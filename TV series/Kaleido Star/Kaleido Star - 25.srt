1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,375
Kaleido Star is about to begin.
So you should make sure that

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,291
your room is brightly lit,
and that you're not sitting

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,250
too close to the television.

4
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,750
That's right, Layla!

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,333
Well, well, well.

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,791
Has anyone ever said
to you 'Don't worry,

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,541
you'll get it next time.'

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,958
Most of the time that's
really great to hear,

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,583
but Layla and I only
have this one chance.

10
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,083
There is no next time for us!
So if I'm going to do this,

11
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:48,083
I have to push myself and fight
for it right now. Right now!

12
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,416
All right, let's eat!

13
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,708
You can really put it away.

14
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,250
I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

15
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,416
I've gotta bulk up, here!

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,250
You're gonna choke
if you don't slow down.

17
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,625
Layla's going to be eating
in her room again today.

18
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,000
She's still trying
to lose weight?

19
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,375
She says it'll help her
keep her concentration.

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,833
I'll take her food up to her.

21
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,708
'An Amazing Bond.'

22
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,125
Here you go, Layla. You look
like you're not feeling

23
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,458
very well today.
Are you all right?

24
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,041
I'm just tired.

25
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,625
Really? I 've got the perfect
thing, it's called 'ume-boshi.

26
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,000
It's so sour but
it gives you energy.

27
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,375
I have some my mother
sent right upstairs.

28
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,833
It's traditional Japanese
medicine. Stay right here,

29
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,166
I'll go get it for you.

30
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,166
No thank you. It's
kind of you to offer,

31
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,041
but I just need a
good night's sleep.

32
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,291
So you don't want it?

33
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,541
Not right now, but I
appreciate the offer.

34
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,708
If you change your mind
you're welcome to it any time.

35
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,208
Sweet dreams!

36
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,541
If I just... get some rest.
It'll be better tomorrow.

37
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,916
It's got to be.

38
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,375
You're making me sick!
Let me go!

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,541
Was was that really necessary?

40
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,083
I'm sorry, Fool.

41
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,375
It's just that I'm so excited
that I'm finally becoming

42
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,541
a real partner for Layla,
just like I'd always hoped!

43
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,208
And this may sound strange,
but I know in my heart that

44
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,541
it doesn't matter what the
Legendary Great Maneuver is,

45
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,750
Layla and I are going
to be able to do it together,

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,208
better than anyone's
ever done it before.

47
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,166
It's almost like
I never had any doubts.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is what I'm
supposed to feel. Isn't it?

49
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,875
So I'm ready to
hear your secret now.

50
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,750
No. It's not time.

51
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:45,416
The inverted Empress. She
is the queen of hardships.

52
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,125
The queen of hardships?
But we're--

53
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,166
What happened?

54
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,416
Did you hurt yourself?

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,541
I thought I just saw
you hit your shoulder.

56
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,500
I just wasn't concentrating and
I scratched it a little bit.

57
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,916
It's all right.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Could it be that
she really hurt herself?

59
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,166
She wouldn't do that! No! No!

60
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,458
We made a promise, no secrets!

61
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,250
She'd never break
her promise to me.

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,583
That's what being equal
partners is all about!

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,333
From the swing,

64
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,375
you'll jump out to the log
but you won't land on it.

65
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
You'll push yourself
off with one hand,

66
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,166
then you'll return to your
platform on your swing.

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,291
Sora. Glad you could join us.

68
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,625
Sorry, Boss! I was
putting these weights on

69
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,291
and I lost track of time.

70
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,291
But the good news is, I should
weigh the same as Layla now.

71
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,500
What are those things?

72
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,375
They're weights
you use for scuba diving.

73
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,541
Sora came up with that idea.

74
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,125
Are you sure about this?

75
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,125
I can't let you bear the burden
of these things all by yourself.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,375
I wouldn't be a very good
partner if I did that,

77
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,750
now would I?

78
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,208
You're right.

79
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,458
Sora you've got a lot of work
ahead of you and these weights

80
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,375
are gonna complicate things.

81
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,333
You're nowhere
near mastering this.

82
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,041
But tomorrow we're going back
to Kaleido Stage for rehearsal.

83
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,375
Right.

84
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,958
You've got to be in synch!

85
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,416
Sora's still too slow.

86
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,208
Maybe it's all the extra weight.

87
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,875
Come on!

88
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,500
We know you can do it!

89
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
I'll take care of the timing,

90
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,041
you just concentrate on
getting out to the log.

91
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,583
Sounds good to me.

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,125
That's right.
Now you're synchronized.

93
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,750
I'd like to try that again.

94
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh my gosh, I did it!

95
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,250
Layla, are you all right?

96
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,125
You didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

97
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,250
No.

98
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,083
I'm sorry. This is
my fault, isn't it--

99
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,250
'cause you had to
match your timing to me.

100
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,291
This has nothing
to do with that. Come on.

101
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,791
Let's get back to it.

102
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,583
We don't have
any time to waste, Sora.

103
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,125
Okay.

104
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,000
Please. Just a little longer.

105
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,583
It just has to last
a little longer.

106
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:00,166
She's crying! Layla, what's
wrong? You are hurt, aren't you?

107
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,541
No. This is none of
your business.

108
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,416
But--

109
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,416
I'm not hurt, so stop asking!

110
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,375
Really, I'm fine.

111
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,541
I know I saw it.

112
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,291
When I walked into the room
she was holding her shoulder.

113
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,791
It doesn't make sense.

114
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,666
If she's injured, why
wouldn't she say something?

115
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,166
Especially after we
promised that we wouldn't

116
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,000
keep secrets from each other...

117
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,416
Yes?

118
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,875
Ta da!

119
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,000
We made her laugh!

120
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,583
All right!

121
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,500
What are you guys doing,
dressed up like that?

122
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,750
Well, Ken told us he thought

123
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,541
you were looking a little
down in the dumps.

124
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,375
And we figured you were probably
feeling worried about the show.

125
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,375
But you shouldn't worry.

126
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,291
That's right, lady.

127
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,916
'Cause we've been to the
future and you rocked it!

128
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,875
Should've quit
while we were ahead.

129
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,375
Yeah.

130
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,458
Thanks, you guys!
You're amazing!

131
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,041
That's what I need. To believe
in myself like I've already

132
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,416
done the maneuver
a million times.

133
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,583
That's the spirit!

134
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,791
Right on!

135
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,416
I've never had any doubt that
Layla would be able to do this.

136
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,333
Now I just have to believe
in myself like I've believed

137
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,458
in Layla all along.

138
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,250
The Moon card. I thought so.

139
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,958
Doubt and anxieties
start creeping in.

140
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,708
How long til you stop
believing in her Sora?

141
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,208
I can't believe we're already
back at Kaleido Stage.

142
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,166
Layla and I have
worked really hard,

143
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,000
and we've both come a long way.

144
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:30,500
But still, I'm not sure
it's gonna be enough.

145
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,541
I'm starting to worry.
What's gonna happen if the Fool

146
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,875
still doesn't think
we're qualified?

147
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,541
It's good to see you.

148
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,541
Glad you're here.

149
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,875
Welcome back you two.

150
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:57,875
Thanks...

151
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,041
...yes, thank you all.

152
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,166
Welcome home. Layla. Sora.

153
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,541
Jean?

154
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,333
Everyone here realizes that
Kaleido Stage isn't what

155
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,500
it could be, or what
it used to be anymore.

156
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,500
But tomorrow's show that's going
to be the first real thing

157
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,916
we've done since you
left and Yuri took over.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,083
That's why we're doing

159
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,541
our best to get everyone
excited about it.

160
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,041
This is the kind of show
we wanna be part of!

161
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,250
You guys...

162
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,000
I didn't think you'd come.

163
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,500
Well has that so-called

164
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,250
spirit of the stage given
you his stamp of approval?

165
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,625
I didn't think so.

166
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,125
Sounds like you won't be
able to do this after all.

167
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,333
You might as well
just admit it.

168
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,500
And fortunately, there's still
plenty of time to cancel.

169
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,416
Just say the word and it's off.

170
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,250
Your juvenile taunting
isn't helping them.

171
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,375
Right. It's you.

172
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,875
The man who cares more about
his wallet than his performers.

173
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,666
I expected you to have
more sense than this, Layla.

174
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,583
You can't perform the Legendary
Great Maneuver tomorrow.

175
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,291
No one can. It's impossible--

176
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,250
That's enough, Yuri.

177
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,583
Do you want to kill yourself?!

178
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,916
Yuri!

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,416
Kalos is just using you!
How can you not see that?

180
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,625
You can't do this!

181
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,083
Then you shouldn't have
announced the show!

182
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,000
We're going on tomorrow
and, what's more,

183
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,791
we're going to succeed.

184
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,750
Everyone else here is
supporting us and wishing us

185
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,083
the best of luck. Except you.

186
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,791
Kalos'll get what he wants.
He'll send you to your death

187
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,083
as long as it helps
the bottom line.

188
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,375
He'll destroy anyone
for money just like

189
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,458
he destroyed my father.
Isn't that right?!

190
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:51,000
Or maybe you were just hoping
that you'd get this place back,

191
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,416
but either way
Kaleido Stage is over.

192
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,500
What are you saying?

193
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,291
My remaining investors
decided to sell Kaleido Stage

194
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,416
after tomorrow's show.

195
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,666
It doesn't matter whether you
can do the maneuver or not.

196
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,666
Well, I guess now you know
how pointless it is for you

197
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,083
to insist on trying that
stupid stunt tomorrow--

198
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,541
I was always proud of
being your partner, Yuri,

199
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,833
so don't make me feel
ashamed of you now.

200
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,166
You need to pull
yourself together.

201
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,166
Sora?

202
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,583
Oh, uh, yes?

203
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,791
The two of us are still
going on. We're going to do

204
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,583
the Legendary
Great Maneuver tomorrow,

205
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,875
no matter what happens.

206
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,916
Right.

207
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,166
We'd never cancel this show.

208
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,958
Oh no. When I slapped
Yuri I made it worse.

209
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,125
The smell of this place--
it's like being home again.

210
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,250
It's so good to be back!

211
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,041
Everyone was waiting for us.

212
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,666
And they all believe
in Layla and me.

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,666
But if the Fool doesn't tell us
what the maneuver is soon,

214
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,291
it looks like they're
all gonna be disappointed.

215
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,916
Sora!

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,791
Do you know where Layla is?
We need to start rehearsal,

217
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,208
but I can't find her.

218
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,833
No, I haven't seen her.

219
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,541
Oh. I wonder where she went...

220
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,375
You go away for a month
and you come back broken.

221
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,083
How could you let this go
for so long before coming in?

222
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,083
The pain must be excruciating.

223
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,125
What probably happened is that
you pulled a muscle in Arizona

224
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,041
and then you kept training
with it and developed

225
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,875
a stress fracture.

226
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,791
It'll probably take
some surgery to fix this.

227
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,375
I can't do that. I've got
a performance tomorrow.

228
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,375
Layla, are you insane?
If you put any more stress

229
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,625
on your right shoulder, I
may not be able to fix it!

230
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,916
I've got to go on.

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,208
Layla! 

232
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
All I want you to do
for me is give me

233
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,875
something to kill the pain.

234
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,833
And I'd appreciate it if you
didn't mention this to anybody.

235
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,750
You're not serious?

236
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,500
Oh, yes I am.

237
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,625
Layla? Layla!

238
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,958
You need to pull
yourself together.

239
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,458
I need to pull
myself together...

240
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,458
Yes?

241
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,708
Layla's where?

242
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,708
What?!

243
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,208
I've gotta see her!

244
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,166
How is she?

245
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,041
Well, right now she's sleeping.

246
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,708
Did she come because
of her shoulder?

247
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,916
How did you know that?

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,333
I thought so.
She did hurt herself...

249
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,625
What happened?

250
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,875
It's nothing, I'm fine.

251
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,541
So she was hiding that from me.

252
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,708
But will she be all right, Kate?

253
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,000
Uh... Well...

254
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,541
We'll have to cancel the
show tomorrow, won't we?

255
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,458
It might be best if her
condition doesn't improve.

256
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,541
I should've said something.

257
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,500
I knew she'd hurt herself.

258
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,750
But she said we wouldn't
keep secrets from each other.

259
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,416
You! Did you want
to kill Layla, too?!

260
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,083
Please, Yuri, he didn't know!

261
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,000
Sora!

262
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,541
Stop it now! This is a hospital!

263
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,083
If Sora saw she was hurt how
could you not notice that

264
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
as her coach, Kalos?

265
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,125
You knew what was going on and
you just kept pushing her!

266
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,250
That's not--

267
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,833
He would never do
something like that!

268
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,583
You're right.
I knew she was hurt.

269
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,625
She was in a lot of pain.

270
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,583
There's no way she could
have hidden that from me.

271
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,916
Then why didn't you stop her?

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,208
Isn't it obvious? Kalos
just wanted Kaleido Stage

273
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,208
back no matter what it cost.

274
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,875
No. That's not true
and you know it.

275
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,625
Layla...

276
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
How do you feel?

277
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,541
I'm sorry, but I felt I had
to contact your friends.

278
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,208
I know.

279
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,791
Kalos knew about my injury and
didn't say anything because

280
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,208
he knew this was something
I had to decide myself.

281
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,041
Isn't that right?

282
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,666
I should've had that same faith
in Arlon all those years ago.

283
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,916
After I saw him practice,
I started to get an idea

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,583
of exactly how dangerous
the maneuver would be.

285
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,791
And of course I was more than
a little nervous he'd fail.

286
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,916
But Arlon was determined to
perfect it for Kaleido Stage.

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
He said that having the
Legendary Great Maneuver

288
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,541
on stage would
'put us on the map.'

289
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,125
He was a shrewd businessman,
and I trusted him.

290
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,458
But after their last rehearsal
I got nervous and said,

291
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,125
'I'll understand if
you want to cancel.'

292
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,250
I put that seed of doubt
in his head. I should have

293
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,083
supported him to the end,
but I didn't.

294
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,291
I won't do that again.

295
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,833
Sora and Layla will have to make
up their own minds about this.

296
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,958
Oh, Kalos, you've finally
broken free from the past.

297
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,333
How ridiculous! Your little
story didn't fool me for

298
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:42,375
a second, Kalos. I'm the one in
charge here and I'm canceling.

299
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,750
If you cancel that show I
will never forgive you, Yuri.

300
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,791
But Layla-- you can't go out
there in this condition.

301
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,416
You'll get yourself killed!

302
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,916
Layla I I think that
maybe we should cancel.

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,250
What did you say?

304
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,708
Just until your shoulder's
completely healed.

305
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,125
We can do the maneuver
some other time.

306
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,458
I mean, when you're
well enough to--

307
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,333
Some other time?

308
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,458
I mean--

309
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,708
When will that be?
A month? Ten years?

310
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,208
I don't-- 

311
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,416
When we're ready, will Kaleido
Stage even exist anymore?

312
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,583
Or that you're not going
to be the one that's injured?

313
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,333
Or that we'll both
still be around?

314
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,125
I can't answer that...

315
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,500
And what about the people who've
already bought their tickets?

316
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,708
As far as I'm concerned Sora,
this show's already started,

317
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,541
and I won't disappoint
anyone by not showing up.

318
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,708
After my Mother died, I watched
my Father give in to his grief.

319
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,208
I swore to myself I'd do
whatever I could to keep

320
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,208
my Father from being
unhappy. And then I--

321
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,916
Make sure you get back to
London and finish the filming.

322
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,250
After that do what you want.

323
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,958
He's disappointed in me.

324
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,375
I don't want to disappoint
anyone else if I don't have to.

325
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:05,333
Layla-- Is that worth risking
your life? This is crazy.

326
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,375
Yuri. How can you,
of all people,

327
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,333
not know why I need this?

328
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,916
It's for the applause
I'll get when I perfect it.

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,583
For the applause you'll get...

330
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,083
So that's why
she's doing this...

331
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:24,083
This is a test of my will,
and I'm going to pass it.

332
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,708
I can do this.

333
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,458
And when I do I'll get
the applause that I want.

334
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:34,083
If I back out now, I may never
be as sure of our success again.

335
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,166
I have to go through with this.

336
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,583
And that's why we can't cancel
this performance. Understand?

337
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,750
Of course. I know exactly
how important this is to you,

338
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,541
Layla because doing the
Legendary Great Maneuver

339
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,250
and hearing the audience applaud
is important to me, too.

340
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,166
But why? Is it just
for Kaleido Stage?

341
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,958
To tell you the truth I
just want to be able to say

342
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:00,958
that I can do it.

343
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,791
That's my reason.

344
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,750
And when I perfect it, I want
you to give me a big hand.

345
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,583
Okay!

346
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,083
Father...

347
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,541
Do what you want.

348
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,041
Yuri...

349
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,791
So the two of you aren't
afraid of dying then, are you?

350
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,541
Why fear it when
it won't happen?

351
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,333
We'll perform the
maneuver perfectly.

352
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,416
The time is now.

353
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,916
The time is now.

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,708
Layla!

355
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:44,541
Sora...

356
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,333
Layla...

357
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,333
Sora!

358
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,208
Layla.

359
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:47,958
Sora...

360
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:48,625
Layla.

361
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:49,541
Sora?

362
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,208
Layla.

363
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,583
Sora?

364
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,416
Everybody, Yume,
we're gonna do this!

365
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,250
Sora, it's time.

366
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,250
Right. Don't miss our
next exciting episode,

367
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,041
'An Amazing Comeback.'

368
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,875
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
