1
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,791
Well, well, well.

2
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,041
Has anyone out there ever had
to keep a really big secret?

3
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,583
If you have, then you
know it's not easy.

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,458
I mean, I promised I wouldn't
say anything, but I'm feeling

5
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,833
kind of bad about having
to keep secrets from people

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,416
I really care about.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Now I understand how Layla must
feel. I do, I do, I really do!

8
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,708
Looks like we can't perform
again. The afternoon show's off.

9
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,458
I'm glad to have
you kids aboard.

10
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,833
Thanks to your show, my park
has more visitors than ever.

11
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,291
I just wanted to
show my appreciation.

12
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,291
Please, I want you to
eat as much as you like!

13
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,541
All right!

14
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,291
I never thought he'd be
this generous of a person.

15
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,333
I guess you can't judge
a book by its cover, eh?

16
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,208
It has nothing
to do with generosity.

17
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,708
If we're well fed,
we'll do better shows.

18
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,083
I always knew you were
a sharp one, Rosetta.

19
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,583
Yeah, real sharp.

20
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,791
But why isn't the Masked Star
joining us for dinner today?

21
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,041
I think she told me she, uh,

22
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,166
had to go to a sickle
and chain workshop.

23
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,416
A sickle and chain..?

24
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,208
Sorry she couldn't make it.
Maybe next time.

25
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,000
'The Amazing Resolve
Beneath the Mask.'

26
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,875
You've received a
bouquet, Miss Layla.

27
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,208
I wonder if it's from your fan

28
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,791
who refuses to believe
that you're in London.

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,541
It's from Yuri.

30
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,416
What?

31
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,666
Are you enjoying hide-and-seek?

32
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,625
Miss Layla, you'll
be late for your flight.

33
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,458
And if you don't
catch the six o'clock,

34
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,875
you'll never make it in time
for filming tomorrow.

35
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,250
I almost forgot.
Let's get going.

36
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,416
I assume you've received
and reviewed the picture

37
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,750
I sent to you.

38
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,416
There's no doubt that
the Masked Star is Layla.

39
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,375
My daughter is busy
filming a movie in London.

40
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,500
It can't be her.

41
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,916
How can you be
so sure of that?

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,291
You know, Yuri,

43
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,541
I hear that Kaleido Stage's
attendance is slipping,

44
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,708
and perhaps you're
having trouble

45
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,333
covering your bottom line.

46
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,791
Even so, it's pretty pathetic
that you would stoop to this.

47
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,916
Well... Sooner or later,
you're gonna find out the truth.

48
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,625
We'll be arriving at Heathrow
Airport shortly, Mr. Hamilton.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,333
And cut!

50
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,458
Fantastic! That was
incredible, Layla!

51
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,416
I'd like to see how
the shot turned out.

52
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
It's my Father!

53
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,750
So, are you in
London for business?

54
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,625
Yes. I'd been planning to come
to one of your little shoots,

55
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,291
so this was the
perfect opportunity.

56
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,833
How is it going, Layla?

57
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,833
Mr. Hamilton, you're not
worried that I'm working

58
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,583
your darling daughter
mercilessly, are you?

59
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,666
Of course not, she'll work as
hard as you feel is necessary.

60
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,125
He knows me too well.

61
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
Well we're glad
to have you here.

62
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,375
A friend of yours called me this
afternoon with some nonsense

63
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,875
about you performing
in an amusement park.

64
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,083
Who did you hear that from?

65
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,875
No, let me guess: Yuri Killian.

66
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, don't be worried about silly
rumors like that, sweetheart.

67
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,208
Just part of being a star.

68
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,625
So, is Dio off today, too?

69
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,666
I think he's got an
afternoon performance

70
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,333
with Theatrical Camp.

71
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,791
Right, when you've got a roof,

72
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,916
it doesn't matter whether
it rains or shines.

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,208
If the rain keeps
coming down like this,

74
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,500
maybe we'll end up
having the whole week off!

75
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,375
Well, if it does keep
raining, we're gonna have

76
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,333
a company meeting so we can come
up with some new show ideas.

77
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,458
You mean we'll have to work?

78
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
Yes, I understand.

79
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,916
But we can talk about a more
detailed schedule later.

80
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:47,958
Rosetta.

81
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,333
If you need to go back home

82
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,416
to take care of your other
engagements, we'll understand.

83
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,541
I know I can go home, I'm
here 'cause I wanna be here.

84
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,041
Don't worry about me, Sora, I've
got everything under control.

85
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,375
I'm glad you're here.

86
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,791
You wanna buy 2,000 admission
tickets to my park per day?!

87
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,791
I'd like to do a promotion
at Kaleido Stage where

88
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,750
we give tickets to the
Marine Park to our patrons.

89
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,375
In order to make this work

90
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,333
I'm going to need 2,000 tickets
per day for the entire summer.

91
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,375
That means I'll need one hundred
eighty thousand tickets.

92
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,833
And I'd like to buy them now.

93
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,875
That's a lot of tickets...

94
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,708
Looks like this is going
to be a rainy month.

95
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,541
As an owner whose business
is affected by the weather,

96
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,041
I don't have to tell you that
this is a dream come true.

97
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
But-- and correct me
if I'm wrong--

98
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,125
aren't we Kaleido
Stage's biggest rivals?

99
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,125
This sale doesn't come
with provisions, does it?

100
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,083
It does. I'll buy
under one condition only:

101
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,708
That you cancel Freedom Lights'
performances and nullify

102
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,541
their contract with the park.

103
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,041
But Freedom Lights
is the biggest draw

104
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,583
we've ever had here.

105
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,250
No one would ever bother to come
if they weren't performing.

106
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,750
That's true even without
the Masked Star, is it?

107
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,916
She may not be back.
Or hadn't they told you that?

108
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,791
No, no need to worry.

109
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,541
I'm glad to hear that the
filming is going so smoothly.

110
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,291
This movie's success is
extremely important, Layla,

111
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,333
it could make or
break your career.

112
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,583
That's why I selected
this project so carefully

113
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,208
and assembled the best
possible cast and crew.

114
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,875
Yes, I understand, Father.

115
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,333
If we keep on schedule,

116
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,541
we should be filming your final
fight scenes by next week.

117
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,833
I'm looking forward
to seeing them.

118
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,083
Thank you.

119
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,541
Looks like she isn't coming...

120
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,250
She what?! The Masked Star
didn't show up today?!

121
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,583
That Mr. Killian
warned me about this...

122
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,208
We're fired?

123
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,750
You can't do that! We
have a binding contract!

124
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,000
That contract is
worthless! You lied to me.

125
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,333
You knew I was more interested
in that masked performer

126
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,666
than any of you.

127
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,541
Now I find out she's not
even part of your company.

128
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,625
I'm so glad that nice Yuri
Killian informed me of this.

129
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,666
Yuri said..?

130
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,833
You heard me. Now all of you
get off my property.

131
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,125
Yuri did this?

132
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,916
Stupid Yuri.

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,333
I never thought
he could stoop so low...

134
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,708
Well, from what I hear,

135
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,250
Kaleido Stage isn't doing
as well as he had hoped.

136
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,708
Freedom Lights is
too much competition.

137
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,291
So do a better job.

138
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,833
We'd never have been a threat
without the Masked Star.

139
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,416
You think so?

140
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,583
We've got to figure out how to
put on a great show without her.

141
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,458
So what is
everyone gonna do now?

142
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,583
Go back to working
humiliating part-time jobs?

143
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,291
I wonder if we could make it
on time for that one...

144
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,541
One what?

145
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,166
The Vancouver International
Performance Festival?

146
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,625
That's right.

147
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,208
I did a diabolo exhibition
there the year before last.

148
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,291
It's perfect! If we raise
our international profile,

149
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,708
the Marine Park will
beg to hire us back.

150
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,250
Forget it, the
deadline's already passed.

151
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,916
No!

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Wait. If you're talented enough
they'll be willing to skip

153
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,833
the application.

154
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,333
I'll ask the admissions board.

155
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,833
I mean... if you want me to...

156
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,833
Of course we want
you to ask them!

157
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,666
Okay, then.

158
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,708
Rosetta, you're amazing!

159
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,541
I know!

160
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,791
You're a rock star!

161
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,625
I'm so glad that
you're on our side.

162
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,166
Let's get everyone over here
and start practicing!

163
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,875
The inverted Magician.
The enemy's trap.

164
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,500
I say no.
They missed the deadline,

165
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,708
they shouldn't be
allowed to participate.

166
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,833
I can't believe they have

167
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,458
the gall to apply
late to a festival.

168
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,041
But wait. This means they're
not aware that I'm on

169
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:42,083
the admissions board. I think
we can include them after all.

170
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,458
So you're telling me the
Marine Park owner canceled

171
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,041
their contract because
of something Yuri said?

172
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
It seems likely.

173
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,333
I knew you'd want to know what
Freedom Lights is doing next.

174
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,875
I found out they
were accepted into

175
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,416
the Vancouver International
Performance Festival yesterday.

176
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,708
That isn't the festival my
Father's going to be judging,

177
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,708
is it?

178
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,375
Yes. And what's more,

179
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,125
Yuri Killian is a
special advisor for them.

180
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,916
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,916
And I took the liberty
of canceling your flights

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,541
to Los Angeles
and San Francisco.

183
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,708
Thank you so much your help.

184
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,250
Don't thank me, you know I'll
do whatever I can to help you.

185
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,416
You're the best.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,583
I hope the rest of
your shoot goes well.

187
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,416
Oh, right. By the
way do you know when

188
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,458
the Vancouver festival is?

189
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,375
Yes, it's this weekend.

190
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,791
This weekend...

191
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,291
If we keep on schedule,

192
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,833
we should be filming your final
fight scenes by next week.

193
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,208
It's funny, you were
my best partner yet.

194
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,708
I don't want to lose this...

195
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,833
I don't want to lose this...

196
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,708
There are new developments
at the festival.

197
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,833
Today a new performance group--
they call themselves 'Z'--

198
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,666
was added to the roster.

199
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,916
They're called 'Z'? I think
I've heard of them--

200
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,708
they're an amateur street
performance group, aren't they?

201
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,708
Yes. I hear they're pretty
unusual because amateur teams

202
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,666
usually aren't
allowed to participate.

203
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,166
But what's more strange is that
their show's really similar

204
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,750
to Freedom Lights'.

205
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,250
Cut!

206
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,125
You're a million miles away.
What's wrong with you?

207
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,666
I'm sorry. Would you
mind if we shot again?

208
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,541
Everyone, take ten.

209
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,708
I called and checked it out
with the festival.

210
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,250
New performers and routines

211
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,291
can be added at any time and
they don't need to be announced.

212
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:16,916
What is this?

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,333
'Z?'

214
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,375
'An acrobatic street performance
team from Vancouver.'

215
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,625
And look at their production--

216
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,041
this is exactly
what ours is like!

217
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,500
Don't tell me
you want to back out.

218
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,666
You probably shouldn't
glare at me like that.

219
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,541
I am pretty influential
at this festival, you know.

220
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:45,166
Z is an extremely talented
group of amateur performers.

221
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,291
It was my suggestion
that they participate here.

222
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,166
I had to bend a few rules to
make sure they were eligible.

223
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,041
I gather you worry there might
be too many similarities

224
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,958
between your programs.

225
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, they are only amateurs.
And you're professionals, right?

226
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,250
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we're proud to introduce

227
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,333
a troupe from right
here in Vancouver.

228
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,000
Please put your
hands together for Z!

229
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,291
Wow...

230
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,958
The crowd loves them.

231
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,333
Ah, our move...

232
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,375
Hey, we do that in our show!

233
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,500
Are they totally copying us?

234
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,583
They are.

235
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,666
Except they've taken our moves
and made them more dynamic.

236
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,500
Once Freedom Lights performs,

237
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll leak to the media that
they stole Z's production.

238
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,333
Then their careers will be over.

239
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,750
It sounds like a good time.
Sure, we'll do it.

240
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,500
And if you do your jobs well,

241
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,000
you will all be welcome
to join me at Kaleido Stage.

242
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,625
Sorry, but I don't
think we're interested.

243
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,666
The audience loves them.

244
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,250
We can't let those guys beat us!

245
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,875
What are we going to do?

246
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,208
Well, if it's an emergency, I
guess we'll have to let you go.

247
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,708
When you come back
for filming next week

248
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,708
I expect you to be perfect.

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,625
Ladies and gentlemen,

250
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,041
give it up for Freedom
Lights from Los Angeles!

251
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,041
It can't be!

252
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,416
How dare you show up here
without giving us any notice?

253
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,041
I just wanted to thank you
for the flowers, Yuri.

254
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,500
All right...

255
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't you get in my way!

256
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,083
Layla, wait!

257
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,791
Uh, well, how about a round of
applause for Freedom Lights?

258
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,958
Layla Hamilton is no longer
a professional performer,

259
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,375
therefore I'm disqualifying
them from this contest.

260
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,458
Layla.

261
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,500
What are you doing here?

262
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,208
Why aren't you in
London on the film set?

263
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,125
I asked them to
postpone my filming.

264
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,458
You had them do what?

265
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,375
I know you can't
possibly understand this,

266
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,500
but being here was
more important to me.

267
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,333
Why? I thought all this
performing nonsense was

268
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,000
over and done with, Layla.

269
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm so sorry. But performing
means so much to me,

270
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,000
and I didn't want to tell you
that because I didn't want you

271
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,750
to be disappointed.

272
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:59,250
I know I should have told you
the truth earlier, Father.

273
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,416
I just couldn't stand

274
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,291
the thought of letting
my friends down...

275
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,541
Oh, Layla...

276
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,875
Besides I realized something:

277
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,583
I won't be happy acting on
film. I want to be on stage.

278
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,500
At least until until I can
perform the perfect show

279
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,416
I won't be satisfied.

280
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,625
I want to earn the kind of

281
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,333
applause that makes
my whole body tremble!

282
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,041
And for the first time

283
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,791
I have a partner that
can make that happen.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,666
Oh, Layla.

285
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,541
I can't leave this
behind, Father, not yet.

286
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,125
Make sure you get back to
London and finish the filming

287
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,541
as soon as possible.

288
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,375
After that do what you want.

289
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:55,458
Father! Did you at least
enjoy what I did out there?

290
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,041
You've got to go after him. You
can't leave things like that.

291
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,583
No, Sora. I've been running
after him for too long.

292
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,333
So what now?

293
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,833
What's this?!

294
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,375
This?

295
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,583
Can you see me now, Layla?

296
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,541
But-- that's impossible, there's
no way to do that maneuver.

297
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,791
So now that Layla is able
to see the Fool, that means...

298
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,791
The Legendary Great Maneuver?

299
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,125
But, I always thought
that was just a myth.

300
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,416
And not only that, but Kalos
finally breaks free from

301
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
the past and begins
to take action.

302
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,958
Looks like the
Legendary Big Maneuver

303
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,333
is finally in our
grasp. Yeah! Yeah!

304
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,875
Don't miss our next episode,

305
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,208
'The Legendary
Amazing Maneuver.'

306
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,875
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
