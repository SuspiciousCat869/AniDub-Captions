1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,500
Okay everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to begin.

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,291
Make sure your room
is brightly lit while

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,708
you're watching Kaleido Star,
and please sit as far away

4
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,833
from the TV as you can.

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,708
Well well well, you've all
given someone a present, right?

6
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,000
You know how you wonder
if they'll like it?

7
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,333
You put all your feelings

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,208
into picking a gift out
for that special someone.

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,958
My gift to people
is performing on stage.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,291
I hope everyone that sees

11
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,041
a Kaleido Stage show
can walk away with a smile.

12
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,583
And I hope the other performers
who work with me feel like

13
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,958
they've been a part of
something great too.

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,166
That would be so awesome,
wouldn't it?

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,125
I am a Kaleido Star, I am, I am!

16
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,958
98...

17
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,125
Practicing during the day
isn't enough for you?

18
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,166
It's nowhere near enough.

19
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,708
The Amazing Injured Swan.

20
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,333
If you keep pushing yourself,
it's gonna continue to hurt.

21
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,416
I know.

22
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,541
You're forcing your body

23
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,833
to compensate for
the basics you lack.

24
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,333
That's why your feet
are in so much pain.

25
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,833
You know he's right, Sora.

26
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,416
Your center of
gravity is unstable,

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,250
so you're compensating
by overworking your toes.

28
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,416
These blood blisters are huge.

29
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,541
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
rest your feet for a few days.

30
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,250
I don't have time to rest...

31
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,875
Okay, fine.

32
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,583
Can I at least
protect the injured areas

33
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,291
so you don't put
too much weight on them?

34
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,333
That would be great, thank you.

35
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,625
We should probably start
working on your balance.

36
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,166
I'll put that on
your training schedule.

37
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,083
One, two, three.

38
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,625
One, two, three.

39
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,375
One, two, three.

40
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,208
One, two, three.

41
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,000
One, two, three.

42
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,958
One, two, three.

43
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,833
One, two, three.

44
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,666
One, two, three.

45
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,708
One, two, three.

46
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,666
One, two, three.

47
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,458
One, two, three.

48
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,625
One, two, three.

49
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,625
Cathy?

50
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,041
I've got a quick
question for you.

51
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,208
What is it?

52
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,500
What scene will
Rosetta be performing in?

53
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,375
None of them.

54
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,375
She's not in the show?

55
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
It wasn't our choice.

56
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,625
There was originally a diabolo
scene written into the script,

57
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,666
but she said she wouldn't
have anything to do with it.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,791
Mia wrote it specifically for
Rosetta, but since she doesn't

59
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,083
want to perform diabolo
we cut the scene.

60
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,541
It really wasn't
necessary anyway.

61
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,250
Does Sora know about this?

62
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,458
Yeah.

63
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,458
Stop everyone.

64
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,375
I'm sorry about this,

65
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,708
but I'm gonna have to rethink
this combination again.

66
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:12,250
Drop this for now, just switch
to individual practice please.

67
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,250
This is the third time.

68
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,375
Hey!

69
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,583
If you guys don't mind,

70
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,458
there's someone I want
to introduce you to.

71
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,125
My feet hurt, but I feel
like I'm getting somewhere.

72
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,208
All this practice is paying off.

73
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,625
I wanna keep practicing.

74
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,208
Sorry I'm late!

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,541
We'll resume your
training this afternoon.

76
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,375
Go.

77
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,000
You should rest until then.

78
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,750
Well, okay.

79
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,541
Welcome all you homely,
I mean, beautiful housewives.

80
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,916
Okay ladies,

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,041
save those vacant looks for
your old tired husbands.

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,583
When you're with me,
I wanna see your wild side.

83
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,041
Cuz I know that's
not gonna happen!

84
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,333
You'd think there'd be
some kind of training gear

85
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,416
that could help Sora
with her problems.

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,875
This chap's brutal.

87
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,416
But he's got this strange
charm and rugged good looks.

88
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,916
I just can't seem
to make myself hate him.

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,458
Clean finish leaves any
surface squeaky clean.

90
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,625
From your kids doodles to the
little secret you've been

91
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,125
hiding from your husband.

92
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,041
It all wipes away.

93
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,666
Come on.

94
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,250
Can't you help me
out a little bit?

95
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,000
Why are you boring us with
this garbage, Junk Baron?

96
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,291
This stuff's not garbage,
it's treasure!

97
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,625
Hey, that's Anna's dad!

98
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,125
What?!

99
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,333
But Anna doesn't
look anything like him!

100
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,666
Our next treasure
helps firm flabby flesh.

101
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,833
Try a pair of
these crazy shoes on.

102
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,833
Don't lose your balance!

103
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,208
That's it!

104
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,833
Hey Jack!

105
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,500
Sorry I'm late.

106
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,541
Hey Anna.

107
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,541
It's the real Jack Baron!

108
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,708
I'm glad.

109
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,375
It sounds like work
is going well.

110
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,916
Yeah.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,333
In fact, I just met with the
producers at the comedy channel.

112
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,208
They want me to do
a half hour program.

113
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,708
Oh wow, cool!

114
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,875
So you're pretty
busy right now, huh?

115
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,291
But you know I've
always got time for you.

116
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,750
I can't refuse
a request from my savior.

117
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,375
I could get hit by lightning.

118
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,916
She's your savior?

119
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,250
Anna is my own little angel.

120
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,291
Okay, I'm ready.

121
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,708
So is the lesson, like,
finally gonna start?

122
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,833
It sure took them long enough.

123
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,708
Maybe that's because
they're close to perfecting

124
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,458
the "Angel's Maneuver".

125
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,375
This is the final
stage of training for

126
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,333
the "Angel's Maneuver".

127
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,833
Already?!

128
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,708
I knew it!

129
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,833
What is the matter?

130
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's get started.

131
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,208
Right.

132
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,375
I'm gonna change the way I
channel my strength every time.

133
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,041
You're going to have to sense
that and adjust for it.

134
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,375
Okay.

135
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,041
We should report to Miss Layla.

136
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:58,916
Let's go.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,291
Like, we're outta here.

138
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,083
Can we do it again please?

139
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,583
Rosetta?

140
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,916
Yeah, what?

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,375
Tell me; is it true that

142
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,125
you're not going to be
performing in Swan Lake?

143
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,416
That's true.

144
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,666
This is an important show

145
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,000
for Sora and I didn't
want to get in the way.

146
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,375
The diabolo scene
was unnecessary.

147
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,833
Hmm.

148
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,125
How mature of you.

149
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,541
But if you don't wanna perform,

150
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,583
why are you peeking in
on everyone's rehearsal?

151
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,500
That's none of your
business, is it May?

152
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,291
If you wanna perform,
why don't you just tell them?

153
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291
I can't.

154
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,666
I've already made my decision.

155
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,583
Amazing.

156
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,083
The "Angel's Maneuver" is
really starting to take shape.

157
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:07,208
But, Sora's balance seems
to be getting worse and worse.

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,416
It's possible for an ugly guy
to play a handsome man.

159
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,708
I'll tell you what,
makeup can do wonders.

160
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,458
But when you look as good as
me there's nothing you can do!

161
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,666
You can push
anything over the top,

162
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,708
and all of a sudden...
it's funny.

163
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,916
Our set design is being
outdone by Sora's energy.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,583
I mean right now it's
a nice little set up

165
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,791
that does what we
need... but that's it!

166
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,208
The only people who will accept

167
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
this kind of textbook
construction are the critics.

168
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,166
It has to be more.

169
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,333
Now hold that
pose and maintain it.

170
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,916
Okay.

171
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,208
That's enough.

172
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,583
The "Angel's Maneuver"
training is over.

173
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,291
Leon, what do you
mean it's over?!

174
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,708
The "Angel's Maneuver"
has been perfected.

175
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,083
I suggest you fine tune it,

176
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,458
and rest your body
until opening day.

177
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,916
Perfected?

178
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,750
You're just saying that!

179
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,250
I can keep going, Leon!

180
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,666
Please wait!

181
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,291
It's over already?

182
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,458
It can't be...

183
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,666
You're breaking off the
"Angel's Maneuver" training?

184
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,916
At the current level

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,333
she can maintain it for
at least five minutes.

186
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,708
And if she saves her strength,

187
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,666
I'm sure she can manage
the two daily shows.

188
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,958
It's enough.

189
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,833
Can you really call that
the "Angel's Maneuver"?

190
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
She lacks basic balance.

191
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,125
She's compensating by
forcibly holding the poses

192
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,500
with her leg strength.

193
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,000
So in that sense,
it's not the real thing.

194
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,541
But the audience won't know.

195
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,833
That doesn't satisfy me Leon.

196
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,666
If she overextends herself,
the show will fail miserably.

197
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,000
I've got it covered.

198
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,083
You just use this time
to work on publicity,

199
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,166
and then you can sit back
and rake in the profits.

200
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,500
Will you be able to make good

201
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,541
on that promise to your
little sister like that?

202
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,708
That is none of your business.

203
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,208
Sora!

204
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,958
What happened?

205
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,041
Where's Leon?

206
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,625
He said my special
training was over.

207
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,750
Oh I see.

208
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,458
But that can't be right.

209
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,500
He gave up on me.

210
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,208
I'm sure that's not true.

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,083
Let me take a look at your feet.

212
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:52,916
Sora!

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
What have you done!

214
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,083
Your balance kept getting worse,
so I knew something was up.

215
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,708
You've torn the
skin off your toes!

216
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,375
If you've come this far
and Leon's given you the okay,

217
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,500
isn't that enough?

218
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,958
No, it's not enough!

219
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,166
I won't give up!

220
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,958
I'll keep going!

221
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,833
There's no way I can wake up
everyone's angel heart

222
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,541
with a maneuver
that isn't perfected.

223
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,541
Her special training is over?

224
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,666
Yes ma'am.

225
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
That's definitely
what Mr. Leon said.

226
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,541
Then Sora...

227
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,458
She, like, totally
didn't accept that.

228
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,083
Really...

229
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,125
Miss Layla,
you're so beautiful!

230
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,916
According to their reports,

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,375
Leon has minimized
her balance training.

232
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,916
He spent that time
strengthening her legs instead.

233
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,625
It seems he's trying to
modify the "Angel's Maneuver"

234
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,875
into something Sora can do
at her current ability level.

235
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,666
But Sora would
never accept a fake.

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,458
She would never do
something half-heartedly

237
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,625
just to keep up appearances.

238
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,791
Well, if Leon can't
completely become a demon,

239
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,833
there's only one way left.

240
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,833
The angel herself will
have to become a demon.

241
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,250
Sora.

242
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,875
You're cutting the
"Angel's Maneuver"?!

243
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,000
You can't do that!

244
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,958
We'll have to rework
the entire stage!

245
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,666
But isn't Sora making progress?

246
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,708
We're making her get
treatment for her feet.

247
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,041
She's ripped the
skin off her toes.

248
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,083
There's no way she can
perform in that condition.

249
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,541
Kalos...

250
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,083
I can still go on.

251
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,958
I can still do it.

252
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,250
Are your feet
feeling any better?

253
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,791
This is ridiculous.

254
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,958
I'll be back.

255
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,000
Wait a minute Sora,
where are you going?

256
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,625
I'm going to ask Leon
to continue my training.

257
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,666
One last time.

258
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,458
Sora!

259
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,791
Oh my, you startled me!

260
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,541
Sarah!

261
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,166
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,208
I have a delivery!

263
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,708
A present from a sensitive man.

264
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,458
You got me a present, Ken?

265
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,958
It's no big deal,

266
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,625
I was just looking for a way
to help you out, that's all.

267
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,416
Woah!

268
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,083
Woah!

269
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,541
I bought some too,
I couldn't resist!

270
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,541
I thought I'd recommend
them to Leon to help with

271
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,125
improving her balance.

272
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,083
They won't put too much of
a burden on her feet either.

273
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:30,125
I'm definitely going to ask Leon
to continue my special training.

274
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,000
So I'll recommend them too.

275
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,375
They're great!

276
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,166
My special training
isn't over yet!

277
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,208
What are you doing out here?

278
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,166
I thought I told you
to rest, Sora.

279
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,083
I have a request: I want you
to continue my training.

280
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,458
I'm begging you.

281
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,708
There's no need.

282
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,750
The "Angel's Maneuver"
has been perfected.

283
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,458
But I know that's not true!

284
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,583
Right now I'm doing all I can
just to fake the appearance

285
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250
of the "Angel's Maneuver".

286
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,291
And it's nowhere near perfect!

287
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't feel right about lying
to the audience like that.

288
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,000
If I say it's over,
then it's over.

289
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,041
If you won't help me, I'll
continue training by myself.

290
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,375
What?

291
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,916
I'm going to keep
training until I'm satisfied.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,250
I swear that I'll perfect
the "Angel's Maneuver"

293
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,875
before opening day.

294
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,833
Then I'll finally
get you to acknowledge me.

295
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,375
Do what you want.

296
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,208
There's a limit to the
amount of pain a person

297
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,625
can put themselves through.

298
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,375
Now who's the fool?

299
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,833
Oh shut up.

300
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,833
It's obviously gonna take
some practice to get used to.

301
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,666
But if I can incorporate balance
training into my daily life,

302
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,750
then eventually I...

303
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,083
The fool aims for
heights, yet unseen.

304
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,250
First, we have to get you used
to the feel of the shoes.

305
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,500
Right!

306
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,708
Rosetta, can you get some water?

307
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,916
Sure!

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,791
Your balance has gotten
a lot better, huh?

309
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,583
Yeah, it has!

310
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,041
It seems that the special
training isn't over.

311
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,666
It's exactly like
Miss Layla predicted.

312
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,291
Head's up!

313
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,166
So how's it feel, Sora?

314
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,541
Awesome!

315
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,500
Since I've been wearing
these shoes I can tell that

316
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,166
I've been overworking my leg
muscles while I was training.

317
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,375
Okay, time to switch legs now.

318
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,166
This is how it should feel.

319
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,958
I just have to get here
without these shoes.

320
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,208
Here's another one!

321
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,166
Okay!

322
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,750
Don't let your pose slip.

323
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,166
Right!

324
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,708
Rosetta.

325
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,416
And if all goes well,

326
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,875
I'm gonna start doing balance
training again tomorrow.

327
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,375
You're fired up, huh?

328
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,875
Will you be able to do the
"Angel's Maneuver" by opening?

329
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,625
I should if I keep practicing.

330
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,166
I promise I'll do my best.

331
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
I really want Leon
to acknowledge me.

332
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,416
I know that you can do it, Sora!

333
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,708
I'll keep
practicing trapeze too.

334
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,541
Then, maybe someday, I'll get
to perform on stage with you.

335
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,916
I look forward to it.

336
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,416
I did it with my leg strength
and I could only do 100 reps.

337
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,833
But if my whole
body is balanced,

338
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,250
I should be able to do more.

339
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,291
She's got even more fighting
spirit than she did before!

340
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,791
This is the
really hard part, Sora.

341
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,250
You have to be in control
of your body at all times.

342
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,291
You can't relax,
even for an instant.

343
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,708
My whole body is straining.

344
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,291
I've only done one rep, and
I feel like I've done ten.

345
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,583
The special training
is moving backwards.

346
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,250
But I don't get why.

347
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,041
She can, like, barely,
like, do it now.

348
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,750
Miss Layla!

349
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,416
It's okay, I'm fine.

350
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,875
So I understand Sora's started
her balance training again,

351
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,625
is that right?

352
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,583
Yes Miss.

353
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,125
That's my Sora.

354
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,041
However, once you've
learned to fake a maneuver,

355
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,291
it's incredibly difficult

356
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,250
to train your body to do
the correct technique.

357
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,625
I have to master the technique
of instantaneously sensing

358
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,458
the flow of my
partner's strength.

359
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,416
Without that,
the "Angel's Maneuver"

360
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,000
will never be perfected.

361
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,791
Sora!

362
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,250
Sora!

363
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,833
Stop!

364
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,250
Why?

365
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,166
Why are you pushing
yourself so hard?

366
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,833
Both you and Sophie.

367
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,791
Why must you be so merciless
towards yourselves?

368
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,750
I thought you were letting
Sora do what she wanted?

369
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,250
Every muscle in your body must
be burning and strained by now.

370
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,833
If you keep doing this,

371
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,916
you'll never be able
to stand on stage again.

372
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,916
I don't care anymore.

373
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,875
I refuse to give the audience
a fake "Angel's Maneuver".

374
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,166
Leon, are you asking me
to do a fake maneuver?

375
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,875
The audience won't
know the difference.

376
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,541
But I do, Leon.

377
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,666
I'll never reach my dream of
a stage without competition.

378
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,208
But what about my dream of
a stage with no competition.

379
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,833
I was fighting all along.

380
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,625
Fighting where
Sophie couldn't see me.

381
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,875
I struck down anyone
who tried to involve Sophie

382
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,750
in their pointless competitions.

383
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,750
Leon, do you think
I can become a true star?

384
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,250
And create a stage
with no competition?

385
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:07,791
Huh?

386
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:08,666
Yes.

387
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,833
I am sure you can do it, Sophie.

388
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
But when all's said and done,

389
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,041
I never believed in
a stage with no competition.

390
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,333
It's nothing but a dream.

391
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,375
It won't happen.

392
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,416
Now, you need to stop this.

393
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,333
I'm not surprised that you
don't believe in it, Leon.

394
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,708
Because nobody's
ever seen it before.

395
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,750
I can't imagine what

396
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,291
a stage without
competition is like either.

397
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:35,250
But you see that's exactly
why I wanna see it one day.

398
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:39,041
And I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make it happen.

399
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,625
I never knew Sophie, but I know
that she wants to see you there.

400
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,750
I know she wants
to watch you perform

401
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,000
on a stage without
competition, Leon.

402
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,416
Promise me, Leon?

403
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,333
I'm sure that
was Sophie's dream.

404
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,083
I know it!

405
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,041
You're saying that her dream
of becoming a true star,

406
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,458
and the promise
I made to her, you think

407
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,458
that was all for my sake?

408
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,500
Sophie knew about your battles.

409
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,500
She knew that you
constantly protected her.

410
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,916
She knew it all, Leon.

411
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,500
Leon, thank you.

412
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,375
I've changed my mind
about training.

413
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,041
We'll start again tomorrow.

414
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes sir!

415
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,541
It seems like Sora is struggling
with something, doesn't it?

416
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,250
What's the difference between
fighting and competing?

417
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,625
Or the difference between

418
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,083
hating each other and
helping each other improve?

419
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,375
Everyone here knows why we
fight and tackle challenges.

420
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,291
Because the audience's
smiles are waiting for us.

421
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,333
They are, they are!

422
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,083
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"Our Amazing Futures".

423
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,000
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
