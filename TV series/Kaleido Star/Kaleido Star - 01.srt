1
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,041
Help me!

2
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,250
Help me!

3
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,750
Help me...!

4
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,291
...help me...

5
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,250
help me...

6
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:36,791
Oh...

7
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,458
I'm so sorry.

8
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,916
My Amazing Stage Debut!

9
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,666
Well, sort of.

10
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,291
So this is home
to Kaleido Stage...

11
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,416
I'm finally here.

12
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
Now all I have to do...

13
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,166
is pass my audition and become
a big, huge mega-superstar!

14
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,625
I can!

15
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,125
I shall!

16
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,125
I will!

17
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:20,458
Okie-doke. So which way
would it be to the stage?

18
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,666
Is it this way?

19
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,416
...Or this way...? Or this
way...? Or this way...?

20
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,833
...Or this way...

21
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,583
Or this way...?

22
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,625
Well which way is it?

23
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh poo, I'm like totally lost.

24
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh good, a newsstand.

25
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,833
They'll be able to help.

26
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,166
Excuse me, ma'am,

27
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,708
I was looking for the
Kaleido Stage and I was...

28
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,291
Kaleido Stage, hm?

29
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,041
Excuse me...

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,458
Hello, excuse me...

31
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,875
Excuse me...

32
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,583
Your muscles
appear very strong.

33
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,125
Whaddya think
you're doing you weirdo!

34
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,041
Stay back.

35
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,875
Careful now...

36
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,291
Huh?!

37
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,125
The only thing I need
to be careful about is creepy...

38
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,125
creeps like you...

39
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,750
you, creep.

40
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,875
And thieves.

41
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
Help with your bag, miss?

42
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:20,750
Hey!

43
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,291
Come back!

44
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,625
You're quick too!

45
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,083
He's tickin' me off!

46
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,666
Stop right there!

47
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,208
Here, use these!

48
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,791
Thanks, young American!

49
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,208
Holy crap...

50
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,791
So that's how
it's going to be...

51
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:41,875
Watch out...

52
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,041
Coming through...

53
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:46,583
Excuse me...

54
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,125
Easy there...

55
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,250
On your left...

56
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,041
I think I'll take this.

57
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,833
Uh...

58
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm really okay, you know...

59
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,291
There's always a lotta
runaways this time of year.

60
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,083
I'm not a runaway,
Mr. Policeman.

61
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,625
I just got here from Japan.

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
Japan?

63
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,791
We don't normally see
runaways from that far.

64
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,791
I told you; I did not
run away from home.

65
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,875
Oh...

66
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,708
I'm going to be
late for my audition.

67
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,416
What am I going to do?

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,750
Hurry up!

69
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,666
Your parents have got
to be worried to death...

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,791
Huh...

71
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh... please don't mind me.

72
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,208
I'm just doing some
warm-up exercises.

73
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,750
Don't worry,
I'm still listening.

74
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,083
That's great.

75
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,625
So you've come to audition
for the Kaleido Stage, huh?

76
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,916
I know I don't look it,

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,583
but I'm actually a huge fan
of the Kaleido...

78
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,375
Augh!

79
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,208
Oh, please don't mind me.

80
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,500
Just pretend I'm not even here.

81
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,833
Yeah, I'll try.

82
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,958
Sora, we can see the Kaleido
Stage just up ahead, here.

83
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,708
Oh wow!

84
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,083
Aauuh!

85
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,750
Well, good luck.

86
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,333
Thank you, Mr. Policeman.

87
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,000
Knock 'em dead, Sora.

88
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,500
Oh poo!

89
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,833
I can't believe I'm so late.

90
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:42,875
therefore...

91
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,083
we will be announcing
the results

92
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,541
from the judges right
after the matinee...

93
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,000
Excuse me...

94
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,708
Oh thank God, I'm here.

95
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,250
Uh...

96
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,875
and you are...

97
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:54,375
Right...

98
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,083
my name...

99
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
is Sora Naegino, sir.

100
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,833
I am very sorry
for my tardiness.

101
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,125
Oh I'm sorry miss, but the
auditions have already ended.

102
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,666
Huh...?! But I came
all the way from Japan

103
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,541
just to be in these auditions.

104
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,041
Uh?

105
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,208
Well perhaps be have time
enough for one more performer.

106
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,208
Oh thank you so much,
you won't regret this I...

107
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,750
 No.

108
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,833
Oh, uh, Miss Leila.

109
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,375
The auditions are over.

110
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,041
 Leila Hamilton...

111
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,083
I can't believe
it's really her.

112
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,708
Uh...

113
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,583
but wait...

114
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,291
there's a reason I'm late.

115
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,458
Don't you know that

116
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,583
a stage production
always starts on time.

117
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,833
But, I...

118
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,791
Go back home.

119
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,125
No wait!

120
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,541
You don't even know
what I can do yet!

121
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,250
Wha...

122
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,583
What are you doing?!

123
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,208
Miss Leila!

124
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,000
Please!

125
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,916
I absolutely, positively,

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,083
desperately want to
join the Kaleido Stage!

127
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,500
 Miss Leila!

128
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,083
I'm sorry, but when
Miss Leila says no...

129
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,208
she means it.

130
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,583
Maybe you can
come back next year...

131
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
I made a promise
to my parents...

132
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,916
that if I failed today,
then I'd quit.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,375
Oh...

134
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,250
Ever since I can remember,

135
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,166
I've always dreamed of
being in the Kaleido Stage.

136
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,125
The show is starting soon --
would you like to come see it?

137
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:49,666
Huh?

138
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,125
Is that okay?

139
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,750
Well, it's the least
I could do for you

140
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,041
since you came all this way.

141
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,083
Oh thanks.

142
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,458
Oh, By the way, I'm Ken.

143
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,000
It's very nice
to meet you, Sora.

144
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
Thank you, Ken.

145
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,250
So did you join because

146
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,916
you fell in love with
the Kaleido Stage too?

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,708
At one time I wanted to be
a cast member, but I have a...

148
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,125
weak heart.

149
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,500
So I decided to provide
support from behind the scenes

150
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,041
in sort of a
management position.

151
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:15,500
Oh...

152
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,458
I gotcha.

153
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,708
Auh!

154
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,500
It's Yuuri...

155
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,666
In person...

156
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,250
He is so coool.

157
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,666
Oh.

158
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,041
I wish there could've been
someplace on that stage for me.

159
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,083
Hey look out!

160
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:10,916
Huh?

161
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,208
Ooow!

162
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,875
You twisted my aaaarrrm!

163
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,500
Ah...

164
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,041
I'm so so sorry!

165
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,291
I'll never
forgive you for this!

166
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,250
I told you not to touch the
sets because they're dangerous.

167
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,583
She's the one
that's dangerous!

168
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,541
I can't go on
stage like this?!

169
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,083
Owie!

170
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:32,458
Owie!

171
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,166
Owie...!

172
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,625
Well this isn't good.

173
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,708
There's a problem,

174
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,250
we need a new trampoline
cast member right away...

175
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,041
I see no need for that.

176
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,125
Heeey!

177
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,000
What is that creep doing here?

178
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,416
B... Boss?

179
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,958
Whu...

180
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,458
the boss?!

181
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,083
You will fill the role.

182
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,500
Huh??!

183
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,625
 Whaaah?

184
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,458
Pardon me for asking sir,
but, what are you thinking?

185
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,041
There's no way an amateur
can just jump into a show cold.

186
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,291
Is that what she said?

187
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:19,791
Uh...

188
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,708
no.

189
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,541
Then it is none
of your concern.

190
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,541
This is my big chance.

191
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,000
Or is it my big demise...?

192
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,333
Oh which is it going to beee?!

193
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,458
Do or die?

194
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,833
You decide.

195
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,041
Anyway, I just have to
think of this as my audition

196
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,333
and do the best I can.

197
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,083
You can do anything...

198
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:44,625
you...

199
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,083
can...

200
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,833
do.

201
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,041
All will be alright.

202
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:52,750
Hmph...

203
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,291
Talking doll...

204
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,000
Ha...

205
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,291
Okay now I've lost it...

206
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,458
Hahahahaha...

207
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,333
Hm?

208
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,541
She's laughing?

209
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,083
Now that's composure.

210
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,833
Sora are you ready?

211
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,458
yeah.

212
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,666
Uhn.

213
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,750
Yalook cute.

214
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,583
Um Ken, what happened
to that girl?

215
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh it was only a sprain.

216
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,291
She'll be back tomorrow.

217
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,833
She's always blowing
things out of proportion.

218
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm glad.

219
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,291
Why'd he pick that girl?

220
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,583
He must have lost his mind.

221
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,125
Another one of Kalos' whims?

222
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,375
It's ridiculous.

223
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:33,916
Shh...

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,958
here she comes.

225
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,583
You.

226
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,750
You're the girl who was
too late for the auditions.

227
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,958
Why are you here?

228
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,625
She's going to be appearing
in the trampoline act.

229
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,333
Hm.

230
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,416
Take off that costume.

231
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,375
Whah...

232
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,916
uh...

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,916
The stage is not so easy that
any amateur can just hop on.

234
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,125
But Layla she...

235
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,583
Didn't you hear me?

236
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,875
Hm...

237
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,916
No I didn't.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,375
Please let me do this.

239
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,750
I'll show you that
I can do it right.

240
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,583
I told her to do the show.

241
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,416
 Kalos.

242
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,458
Now go.

243
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,500
'Kay.

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,333
Okay the performance goes
just like I told you.

245
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,250
Right.

246
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,750
And don't forget
to keep smiling.

247
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,000
Right.

248
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,250
Oh poo.

249
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,500
What am I supposed
to do first again...?

250
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,333
I hope she's going to be okay.

251
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
Oh, man...

252
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,916
Oops!

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Look out!

254
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,208
Oh, Sora...

255
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,541
No...

256
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,708
I can't do it...

257
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,208
I can't perform...

258
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,083
I'm going to fail...

259
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,208
Nooo...

260
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,250
Keep trying, Miss Rabbit!

261
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,500
 That's right...

262
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,375
I can't say that I can't do it.

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,625
I can do it.

264
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,791
I can do it.

265
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,958
Miss Rabbit...!

266
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,166
They love it!

267
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,458
Now if she can
just nail the finale.

268
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,541
Uh...

269
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,208
I can't see below...

270
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:18,875
Oh, no.

271
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,916
Sora...! ungh...

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,125
Move it.

273
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,416
Y-Yuuri.

274
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,291
Just keep smiling 'til the end.

275
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh-kay.

276
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,333
Hey good job out there, Sora.

277
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,625
I'm just glad
you didn't break your neck.

278
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,958
Thanks...

279
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,083
And it seemed like
the crowd was really into you.

280
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,500
Don't encourage her.

281
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,875
How dare you go and make

282
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,833
a mockery of the stage
just before my act.

283
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,375
I...

284
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,083
I'm sorry...

285
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,291
I just wanted to be part of
Kaleido Stage so badly...

286
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,833
And that's reason enough for
our audience to be subjected

287
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,083
to such a
disgraceful performance?

288
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,500
You're a naive little girl.

289
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,583
Don't you
understand that by now?

290
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,166
Yeah.

291
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,083
There is no place
for you here.

292
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,166
Yeah...

293
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,958
I think you should go now.

294
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:38,458
Yeah...

295
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,000
Uh... Sora!

296
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,500
Let her go.

297
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,666
The Golden Phoenix...

298
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,416
The routine Miss Leila
made famous...

299
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,250
Even in death, Juliet's
love burns for eternity

300
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,458
like the flames
of the Phoenix.

301
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,583
It's her unending desire that
the Golden Phoenix is all about.

302
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,916
Compared to that
level of performance,

303
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,708
I can't even get
the fire started yet.

304
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,375
Good job, you two.

305
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,250
And where did she go?

306
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,583
Sora!

307
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,541
Sora wait!

308
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,333
W-wait a minute!

309
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,083
You don't have to go back home!

310
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,500
Huh?

311
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,375
 The--boss--said--
that--you--passed!

312
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,958
Yes Sora!

313
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,833
You passed!

314
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,916
I did it...

315
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,875
I don't understand you.

316
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,125
You're passing

317
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,333
an unknown amateur
who didn't even audition.

318
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,958
Someday, the audience
will come here just to see

319
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,208
this little girl perform.

320
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,291
Is is true?

321
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,875
Yes it is --
that's what Kalos told me.

322
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,583
Are you sure?

323
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,208
Of course I'm sure.

324
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,333
Have some confidence
in yourself.

325
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,833
Besides I'm glad we don't
have to say goodbye to...

326
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,416
Sora!

327
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,541
Mr. Policeman!

328
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,708
How'd it go?

329
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,500
I passed!

330
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,291
I did it!

331
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,875
I'm in the Kaleido Stage!

332
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,125
That's great.

333
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm so happy for you.

334
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,833
I knew you had it in you, kid.

335
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,500
Thank you so much...

336
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,333
Well starting today,
I'm your biggest fan!

337
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,875
Hahahaha!

338
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,083
This is the dormitory
where you'll be staying.

339
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,541
You should probably
get some rest after today.

340
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,708
Thank you.

341
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,416
Good night.

342
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,791
Kaleido Stage...

343
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,083
I can't believe
I'm really here!

344
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,041
Yes!

345
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,041
...huh?

346
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:12,583
Uhn...

347
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,208
uh...

348
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,625
that doll again...

349
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,541
heh?

350
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
Ok, spooky...

351
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,000
How could that same
strange doll end up here?

352
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,416
You see, you see me.

353
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,041
Whah!

354
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:23,791
It talked!

355
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,291
Doll!

356
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:24,791
Talk!

357
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,208
Bwahahahaha!

358
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,791
Please hold the hysterics.

359
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,583
My name, friend, is Fool.

360
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,625
Spirit of the Stage.
