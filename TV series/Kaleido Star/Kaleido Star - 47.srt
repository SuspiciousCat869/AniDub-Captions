1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,750
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,000
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,333
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV!

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,875
Well well well, what are some
of your favorite memories

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,375
from when you were a kid?

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,916
Did you go somewhere cool
with your mom and dad?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Did you do lots of fun
things with them?

8
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,833
I bet you were happy
just to be near them.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,750
Memories are like
gifts you know,

10
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,000
they're treasures that
stay with you forever.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,958
They can even change your life,
just look at me!

12
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,375
The whole reason
I'm here is because

13
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,958
of my memory of that day.

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,458
I'll never forget.

15
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,458
I don't want you guys to forget
either, I don't, I don't!

16
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,666
Leon?

17
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,333
Leon, are you listening to me?

18
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,916
Hello Leon?

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,333
I am listening.

20
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,375
Well, I think that I need
to start training harder.

21
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,750
I really want to perfect
the "Angel's Maneuver"

22
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,625
before the festival.

23
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,041
The circus festival
happens every year.

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,166
There's no need
to rush, Sophie.

25
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,291
I know.

26
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,500
But it's been more than

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,958
five years since we
left Alan's training.

28
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,291
And we are doing fine.

29
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,208
None of that time
has been wasted.

30
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,583
We've been invited to perform

31
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,791
as guest performers
by all kinds of circus troupes.

32
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,666
And even if we are
in the lowest seat,

33
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,125
we've been nominated
for the Circus Festival.

34
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,291
But that's all
because of you Leon.

35
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,208
I'm just a bonus.

36
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,291
You're always in
rigorous training just so

37
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,625
you'll be able to
cover my inadequacies.

38
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,125
I'm tired of
watching you struggle,

39
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,625
I must train harder too.

40
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,125
It's not rigorous training.

41
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,666
It's a habit I've had
since I was a kid.

42
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,125
Oh never mind, I'll just
have to do it myself.

43
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,291
Hold on!

44
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,541
I'll perform a perfect
"Angel's Maneuver"

45
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,041
at the Circus Festival,
without your help!

46
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:32,916
Sophie!

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,458
Okay, fine then.

48
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,291
I'll rework the practice
menu for the Festival.

49
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,041
Only a demon can raise an angel.

50
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,541
Flight of the Amazing Angel.

51
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,333
We are shooting for a
perfect "Angel's Maneuver"

52
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,500
like I described
to you yesterday.

53
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,625
Have you burned that
image into your mind?

54
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,500
Yes.

55
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,750
Good then.

56
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,541
You'll start by doing
right-leg-only squats

57
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,625
on that log.

58
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,625
But you can't
let the water ripple.

59
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,875
We can't go on until
this is perfected.

60
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,541
I'll perfect it then.

61
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,750
Call me when you can
do it on either leg.

62
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,000
Right.

63
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,583
Well, we should get going.

64
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,250
We've all got a lot to do.

65
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,583
Okay.

66
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,041
I wanna stay here with
Sora a little bit longer.

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,250
Take care of her, Marion.

68
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,791
This is gonna take a while.

69
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,958
I'll do it this time.

70
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,250
Do you really think that Sora
can become a true Kaleido Star?

71
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
To be honest I don't know.

72
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,833
But even so, I think my
chances are better with Sora.

73
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,708
Lemme get this straight;
you believe in her that much

74
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,625
but when she went back to
Japan you didn't do anything?

75
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,833
I knew that Sora
would come back.

76
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,541
She knows she's not done
growing as a performer.

77
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,125
Other than invite Leon here,
I haven't done anything.

78
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,833
In all reality, all I did
was terminate her contract.

79
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,875
I'm sure she'll find her own
path to becoming a Kaleido Star.

80
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,666
There may be a few detours along
the way, but I'm a patient man,

81
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,166
and I'll stick by her.

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,041
The truth is she
came back on her own.

83
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,041
It's almost as if the stage
itself loves her and refuses

84
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,458
to let her go.

85
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,541
Really?

86
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,083
I'm not quite sure why,

87
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,666
but hearing you say that makes
me feel... a little jealous.

88
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,583
Kalos.

89
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,208
Listen, I have
a proposal for you.

90
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,708
I need a move.

91
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,833
I need a new move
that can compete with

92
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,000
the "Angel's Maneuver".

93
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,291
Careful...

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,291
It's rippling.

95
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,833
Oh no....

96
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,375
I'm not sure if I can do this.

97
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,708
Sora?

98
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,625
Oh no!

99
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,708
Did you give up
already Sora? Sora?

100
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,500
I... got a little... cold...

101
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,500
Thanks for the food.

102
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,125
It's warming me up.

103
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,166
You really shouldn't
push yourself so hard.

104
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,791
I... I know.

105
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,458
It's a good thing
Marion stayed with you.

106
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,791
Sora!

107
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,791
Hey, I want you
to take a look at this.

108
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,666
Mia!

109
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
Did you come up with something?

110
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,041
Yeah!

111
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,375
I talked it over with Cathy,

112
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,750
and I think it's all gonna
work out beautifully.

113
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,041
I just wanted to
get your opinion.

114
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,625
I want all of you to
tell me what you think.

115
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,625
It's so cute!

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,875
Thank you!

117
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,125
Now there are many different
interpretations of Swan Lake,

118
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,000
but here's the most
traditional one.

119
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,125
In this version the
demon is defeated.

120
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,208
But Odette and Prince Siegfried
die while fighting it.

121
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,458
It ends happily though,

122
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,000
because the two lovers
are reunited in Heaven.

123
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,250
But what about the
demon princess Odile?

124
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,083
Exactly!

125
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,666
You see that's the mystery!

126
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,916
After she tricks the prince,

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,041
Odile disappears from
the story altogether.

128
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,083
Odile loves the prince as well.

129
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,458
Can't there be a story where
Odile gets to be happy too?

130
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,541
I thought you'd say that!

131
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,750
And that's how I came up
with the idea of Odile

132
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,250
being a personality that
lives inside of Odette.

133
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,125
So the loving heart that cares
for the prince is Odette.

134
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,083
Well, Odile is the
hate of that heart

135
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,125
that wants the
prince to herself.

136
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,541
Even though they're in conflict,
they're after the same thing.

137
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,958
Odette realizes that
hate is a form of love.

138
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,416
So she accepts Odile,

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,333
and then her love grows and
becomes all encompassing.

140
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,166
Hate is a form of love?

141
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,250
Odette not only
accepts Odile's hate,

142
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,291
but she turns into love itself.

143
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,166
I want that Odette
to be represented by

144
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,833
the "Angel's Maneuver"!

145
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,375
Wow.

146
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,666
Happy Ending!

147
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,958
It sounds great to me!

148
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,791
I like it more
than the original!

149
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,000
Really?!

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,541
Sora?

151
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,875
Um, do you not like it Sora?

152
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,666
I think it's awesome Mia,
I'm really excited about it!

153
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,875
I'm just worried if I can

154
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,708
play a really beautiful
angel like Odette.

155
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,333
Never fear, the character's been
written for your personality!

156
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,375
Yay!

157
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,208
Alright, I'm getting
all fired up!

158
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,958
The angel Mia envisions...

159
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,500
She accepts her hatred

160
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,041
and becomes a love that
is all encompassing.

161
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,250
A true star may need
to do that as well.

162
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,666
But when I was faced with hate
and anger at the Circus Festival

163
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,166
I crumbled and ran away.

164
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,250
Can I possibly become an angel?

165
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,458
An angel, huh?

166
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,666
Kaleido Stage is
pleased to announce

167
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,833
that our grand reopening
show will be... Swan Lake.

168
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,541
The lead, Sora Naegino,

169
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,250
will perform a move capable
only of a true Kaleido Star.

170
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,416
Would that be the
"Angel's Maneuver"?

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,041
Didn't Miss Naegino withdraw
from the Circus Festival?

172
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,833
I have enough confidence
in her to open the show.

173
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,041
She hasn't mastered
the maneuver yet, has she?

174
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,708
So, Mr. Oswald; are you
completely satisfied with

175
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,958
Sora Naegino as a partner?

176
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,416
Of course I am.

177
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,208
Huh?

178
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,125
It's rippling...

179
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,416
It's no use.

180
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,000
The rippling of the water is
like a wavering of the heart.

181
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,833
She cannot become a true star

182
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,791
while she still harbors
this... uncertainty.

183
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,583
The angel Mia
envisioned for me...

184
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,333
An angel who accepts hatred,
competition, jealousy,

185
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,083
and everything else.

186
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,958
If I can't learn to do that,

187
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,833
maybe I can't become
a true Kaleido Star.

188
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,958
It won't even matter if I can do
a perfect "Angel's Maneuver".

189
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,291
The reality is you beat me
and got the lead in the show.

190
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,125
Even though I'm not trying to,
I'm still competing with May.

191
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,708
Why don't you even try?

192
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,958
Why do you keep running away
from competition?

193
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,125
I think you should take some
time and think about how

194
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,750
your refusal to compete
just now has affected May.

195
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,833
It is impossible to become
a star without being hated

196
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,875
or resented by someone.

197
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,041
If I could just admit to
myself that it won't happen.

198
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,625
I wouldn't agonize like this
if I'd admit that my dream

199
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,208
isn't possible.

200
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,500
So you've decided to take
the easy way out, Sora?

201
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,500
Don't be selfish.

202
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,250
Remember the feelings
of the audience.

203
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,458
I know that I should, but I...

204
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,208
Should go buy new underwear!

205
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,166
These sports bras are so ugly!

206
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,375
What do you think you're doing?!

207
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,833
Didn't you get
something more frilly?

208
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,166
What's the matter with you?!

209
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,208
With me?

210
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,083
I was just trying to be nice
and unpack your boxes for you.

211
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,208
Sorry I helped!

212
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,791
Thanks but no thanks.

213
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,333
Oh, I see.

214
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,125
I thought that you were
finally gonna give me

215
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,833
some advice I could use.

216
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,541
I was. Advice about
your underw--

217
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,083
Thanks but no thanks!

218
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,166
If you've become uncertain,
try taking a break from practice

219
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,541
to see if that can
change your mood.

220
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,708
A break?

221
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,875
You're not getting
much accomplished

222
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,083
by jumping in head
first, are you?

223
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,458
Well, no.

224
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,375
Well then, you're chances
are the same either way.

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,083
Yeah, I guess you're right.

226
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,125
I haven't been to
Cape Mary Park in a while.

227
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,458
Maybe I'll go there.

228
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,791
While you're out,

229
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
why don't you pick up some
of those ruffly panties?

230
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,750
Not gonna happen.

231
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,958
No uncertainty there.

232
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,416
You know, even though these
people look happy to me,

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,416
they be angry and fight when
I'm not there to see them.

234
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,208
I shoulda kept practicing.

235
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,875
This isn't making me
feel any better.

236
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,916
Angels!

237
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,208
It's no use, I don't get it.

238
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,916
Oh, I'm so sorry!

239
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,291
I uh, I didn't notice
you were there.

240
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,791
Is his paw okay?

241
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,625
Yes.

242
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm sure he'll be fine.

243
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,708
Good boy.

244
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,291
You handled that very well Love.

245
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,416
Good dog.

246
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,291
Oh thank goodness!

247
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,416
I'm so sorry.

248
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,666
So you didn't do it
intentionally?

249
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,166
I would never do that!

250
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,750
I'm glad to hear that.

251
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,291
But some people
will step on his feet

252
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,625
when they realize
he's a seeing-eye dog.

253
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:22,791
On purpose?

254
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,375
Can you believe it?

255
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,250
Seeing-eye dogs are trained not
to bark while they're working.

256
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,458
So people will step on him

257
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,958
to see if he'll bark
because of the pain.

258
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,541
I'm Donna Walker.

259
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,708
And his name's Love.

260
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm his trainer.

261
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,125
He's training to become
a seeing-eye dog.

262
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,291
Nice to meet you.

263
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,791
I'm Sora Naegino.

264
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,500
I'm sorry Love,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

265
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,250
You're Sora Naegino?

266
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,666
The same Sora that's going to
play the lead role in Swan Lake?

267
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,041
Uh, yeah.

268
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,666
Skipping practice?

269
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,583
Kalos called me a few days ago.

270
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,541
He told me that I had
to come out and watch

271
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,666
a true Kaleido Star be born.

272
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,083
Yeah?

273
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,125
But skipping practice is bad,
isn't that right Love?

274
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,666
Why would the boss
contact her directly?

275
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,666
Who is she?

276
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,208
I feel like I've seen
her somewhere before.

277
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, we're in
the middle of training.

278
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,708
Alright, let's go Love,
straight ahead!

279
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,708
Are you the Donna Walker
who played Alice?!

280
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:28,708
That's right!

281
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,166
I'm a huge fan of yours!

282
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,250
Oh, do you think you could
sign my shirt for me please?

283
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,541
Yay!

284
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,708
Thank you so much Miss Walker.

285
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,875
I'm sorry, I ended up
following you all the way

286
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,291
to your training ground.

287
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,791
Oh it's alright.

288
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,750
In all honesty it's kinda nice
to know that I have a fan.

289
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,083
I'm not the only one.

290
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,083
Layla's a big fan of yours too.

291
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,041
She was disappointed she
didn't get to perform with you,

292
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,416
but you had already quit the
troupe by the time she'd joined,

293
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,666
right?

294
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,916
Yes.

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,791
I simply couldn't bear
standing on stage again.

296
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,291
I couldn't handle the pain
of climbing to the top.

297
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,500
I hated questioning
people's motives,

298
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,583
and worrying about
someone stealing my spot.

299
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,041
It seemed like everyone around
me had the heart of a demon.

300
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,500
So one day I ran away.

301
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,875
And since that day, I've had no
desire to stand on stage again.

302
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,625
I see.

303
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,708
But that show was
so incredible.

304
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,708
And you were amazing in it.

305
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,958
The whole stage sparkled!

306
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,041
I dunno, I just felt like
the whole cast got along

307
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,375
on stage and off.

308
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,291
You probably didn't have
any hatred or competition.

309
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,625
I just wish every show
could be... like that.

310
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,875
Normally I'd feel obligated
to lie and say "you're right".

311
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,208
But since you're
a stage performer as well,

312
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,333
I'll go ahead and
tell you the truth.

313
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,625
But... you mean...

314
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,208
That's right.

315
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,291
The reason I couldn't perform
any longer was because I felt

316
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,958
like I was deceiving audience
members like you, Sora.

317
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,583
Hey, up Love!

318
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,791
It took me a while
to understand everything.

319
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,125
Working with these dogs
has helped me sort it all out.

320
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,541
I love these dogs.

321
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,000
They're angels.

322
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Angels?

323
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,500
That's right!

324
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,166
Slightly mischievous angels.

325
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,958
Excuse me, but could
you please show me

326
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
why these dogs are angels?

327
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,916
Please Miss Walker.

328
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,125
Now it might be a little
scary at first Sora.

329
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Uh, yeah.

330
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,583
Alright, let's start walking.

331
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,208
Okay.

332
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,958
Love, up!

333
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,958
Love, straight ahead.

334
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791
Don't brace against him.

335
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,041
Right.

336
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,458
He's moving fast.

337
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,041
Wait, that's too fast!

338
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,125
Love, stop now.

339
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,500
Were you really frightened?

340
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,208
Yeah.

341
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,041
And that was much slower
than a normal walking pace.

342
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,375
Wha?

343
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,875
Love could feel your
unease through the harness,

344
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,250
and so he walked
more slowly for you.

345
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,166
Now why don't you trust
Love and try it again.

346
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,541
Sure, Love, go!

347
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,458
Hey, this seems
to be going well.

348
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,666
Alright, alright!

349
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,416
Wait a minute,
where are you going, Love?

350
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
That's not the right way...

351
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,708
He tried to avoid an obstacle.

352
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,541
You've got to trust Love
and let him lead you.

353
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,291
Right.

354
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,541
What's the matter?

355
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,666
Go!

356
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,708
Come on!

357
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,416
Let's go, Love!

358
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,583
Sora?

359
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,041
Take off your mask.

360
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,083
Now you see, if this
were a real street,

361
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,166
you could have been
hit by a car.

362
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,250
Good dog, Love.

363
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,750
Good boy.

364
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,250
You praise him too, Sora.

365
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,666
You did great Love.

366
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,916
Thanks so much.

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,458
Good dog, very good dog!

368
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,708
That was hard, wasn't it?

369
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,291
Yeah.

370
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,583
These dogs have to go through
all kinds of special training.

371
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,000
Only about a third of the dogs
actually become seeing-eye dogs.

372
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,416
The others become family pets.

373
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,541
I feel sorry for them.

374
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,958
Tell me Sora,

375
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,416
do you think that the dogs
are being forced to train?

376
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,416
You mean they're not?

377
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,750
Take a good look.

378
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,500
Does it look like
they're suffering?

379
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,416
No.

380
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,916
They look very happy.

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,625
You see, they know that if
they follow our instructions,

382
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,083
we'll be pleased with them.

383
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,541
There's one thing that
makes these dogs truly happy,

384
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,416
and that's to please
the people they work with.

385
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,583
Love, come here boy!

386
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,125
These little guys don't
want anything more than

387
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,291
to make those around them happy.

388
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,583
That's the reason that
I think they're angels.

389
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,291
When I left Kaleido Stage, I was
so negative and pessimistic.

390
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,208
But that changed once I started
working with these guys.

391
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,000
I realized there's still
a lot of good in the world.

392
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,625
Anyone who stands on stage
must have an angel's heart.

393
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,666
A heart that wants
nothing more than to give

394
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,875
the audience a good time,
and make everyone happy.

395
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,041
Unfortunately, competition
and jealousy can sometimes

396
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,708
turn those angel
hearts to hatred.

397
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,833
In fact, I'm sure you saw our
angel hearts when you watched us

398
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,250
perform in
"Alice in Wonderland".

399
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,125
So performers
all have angel hearts?

400
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,541
That's right.

401
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,541
I just couldn't
see them back then.

402
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,833
I see.

403
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,041
During the Festival,

404
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,666
I couldn't see anyone's
angel hearts either.

405
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,666
But when Mute and the others
were talking about their dreams,

406
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,708
their eyes weren't lying.

407
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,791
They all had dreams, and
they all had angel hearts

408
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,125
that wanted to give
the audience a good time.

409
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,000
All the stress of the
competition simply hid

410
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,625
their angel hearts
and caused hatred.

411
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,458
"Hate is a form of love".

412
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,875
So that's what it meant!

413
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,375
In that case...

414
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,750
You really had
a serious look on your face,

415
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,875
so Love was worried about you.

416
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,833
Love!

417
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,458
Thanks so much boy!

418
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,708
I'd never be able

419
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,625
to move forward again
if it wasn't for you.

420
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,375
Sora?

421
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,541
Yeah?

422
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,291
I'm looking forward
to seeing the birth

423
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,375
of a true Kaleido Star.

424
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,250
Thank you!

425
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,833
I'll do my very best!

426
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,833
Maybe the "Angel's
Maneuver" isn't a maneuver

427
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,583
to become an angel.

428
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,125
Maybe it's really a maneuver

429
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,625
to wake up the angel
hearts inside of everyone.

430
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,416
I'm sure that's what it is!

431
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,125
Now I believe in
the angel inside of me.

432
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,083
I believe in the angel
inside of everyone.

433
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,000
I believe in the
"Angel's Maneuver".

434
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,166
Yeah, looking good, Sora! 

435
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,708
Seems like something's different
about her since yesterday.

436
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,833
She doesn't
doubt herself anymore.

437
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,041
You'd think doing it
that slowly would cause

438
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,666
the water to ripple more.

439
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,625
Yeah, but that log isn't moving.

440
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,458
It's not rippling!

441
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,083
She did it!

442
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,125
Right leg success!

443
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,833
Yeah!

444
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,625
Impressive as always Sora!

445
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,208
She really did it!

446
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,041
Yeah, she's some kinda freak.

447
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,125
Way to go Sora!

448
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,958
It appears that Sora
has passed the first stage.

449
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,375
Let's go home girls.

450
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,250
Yeah.

451
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,583
Like.

452
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,125
Keep pushing yourself.

453
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,333
Stop it!

454
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm not gonna cheat the
audience with a fake maneuver.

455
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,333
Sora's intense
training has begun.

456
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,416
Why do you--

457
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,375
I won't stop!

458
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,208
I've come to reclaim my dream
that I entrusted to you.

459
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,083
The one thing that I forgot
when I left the stage.

460
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,916
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"The Amazing Injured Swan".

461
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,791
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
