1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,791
Hello, everyone,
Kaleido Star is about to start.

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,250
So please make sure that
your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,041
and that you aren't sitting
too close to the television.

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,791
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,791
Have you ever tried really
hard at something even though

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,041
you weren't sure you'd succeed?

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,583
Seems like I'm always
doing stuff like that...

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,541
But this time I think
I'm in way over my head.

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,833
I mean, Layla's just so amazing.

10
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,250
But we're about
to open our show,

11
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,333
and I'm not going
to let her down now.

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,750
I'm not, I'm not!

13
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,583
No Sora, that
wasn't fast enough.

14
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,833
I know. I'm sorry.
Can we try it again?

15
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,583
All right, get back up here.

16
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,250
That routine is so hard.

17
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,791
I know.

18
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,083
All right!

19
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,166
Sorry, Layla.
I was too early with that.

20
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,583
One, two, three!
One, two three--

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,291
Sorry!

22
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,375
They've got less than a week
to go before the show opens.

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,166
I know, and Sora's
way too freaked out

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,958
about the timing of this thing.

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,000
She's so worried about getting
it perfect she messes it up.

26
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,166
'The Amazing Competition
Calls Up A Storm.'

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,125
I don't know what Kalos
was thinking on this one.

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,458
I mean, your performance styles
mix about as well as oil

29
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,166
and water, Layla.

30
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,166
On the other hand, all of
this could be part of some

31
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,583
publicity stunt that he's
dreamed up. What if he's

32
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,916
just using the two of you?
One thing's certain:

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,083
to succeed you're going to have
to perform at Sora's pace.

34
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,708
If she wants to
keep playing leads,

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,375
then she should perform at mine.

36
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,458
Right...

37
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,875
One, two, three!
One, two, three--

38
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,875
Not your most graceful.

39
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,708
I just can't seem
to get the timing right.

40
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,958
If I stay with
Layla I'm too slow,

41
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,208
but if I do my own
thing I'm too fast.

42
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,625
I've just gotta find
some way to match her...

43
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:07,958
Sora?

44
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,041
Yes?

45
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,333
You have a guest.

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,583
Huh? I'm not
expecting anyone... Yes?

47
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,041
But, Layla what are you--

48
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,875
I'll leave you kids to it.

49
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:20,666
Thank you.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,791
Yeah, okay. So what's up?

51
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,875
I'm going to be staying
with you. If you don't mind.

52
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,041
Wha?!

53
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,500
Oh. That's just a video
I had Ken make for me.

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,500
I thought it would help me
get your timing.

55
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,041
That's exactly why I came here.

56
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,000
I need to observe the way
you move in day-to-day life.

57
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,291
By living in close quarters,

58
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,375
I hope we can understand
each other's movements better.

59
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:47,833
So we understand each other's
movements better? Right.

60
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,083
She looks so elegant...

61
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,041
Oh my.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,416
What's that?

63
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,083
Oh, nothing, I just thought
it looked cool how you took

64
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,666
your jacket off just then...

65
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,583
Mercy!

66
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,750
I was just about to go

67
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,833
get some dinner
in the dining hall, Layla.

68
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,375
Want me to bring you something?

69
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,916
No, I'll come eat with you.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,583
Sora!

71
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,875
Wanna get some food?

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,583
What the--

73
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,541
What's she doing here?

74
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,458
Oh, she's going to be living
in my room for a little bit.

75
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,250
Huh?

76
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,333
Let's eat.

77
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,750
If they wanted
a new face for a costar,

78
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,250
they should've chosen one of us.

79
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,583
That fight would be perfect
if I'd done the show.

80
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,166
Could you keep
the line moving please?

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,375
I'm not finished
making my salad yet.

82
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,791
Layla's got a
really graceful walk.

83
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,166
Even when she's not
in front of an audience...

84
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you want me
to make some coffee?

85
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
No thank you. But I would
like to use your shower.

86
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,125
Oh the nerve of her!

87
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,833
Are you sure?

88
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,791
Is something wrong?

89
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,166
Um, I uh--

90
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,041
No, of course not, silly!
Go ahead, take your time.

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,541
This is an outrage!

92
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,458
I'm a free spirit. I can't
be caged up like this!

93
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,500
Even the way she said
no to coffee was...

94
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,416
Look at that!

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,708
Ooh...

96
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,916
Uh, Layla,

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,333
wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a pair of my pajamas?

98
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,666
What's that?

99
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,083
You know, so you can get
in touch with my rhythms.

100
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,333
But how would that...?

101
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,666
Here, I'm pretty sure
this one would fit you.

102
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,791
But I don't--

103
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,250
Look, if you're gonna

104
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,875
stay in my room, you've got
to follow my rules, okay?

105
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,166
Whatever you say.

106
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,708
Oh, no, Layla, I want
you to take the bed.

107
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,375
I'm happy to sleep on the floor.

108
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,708
I'm sleeping on the floor
and that's final.

109
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
Sure.

110
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,250
Having Layla live with me,
having her sleep in my room...

111
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,875
If I can't get the timing
right after this-- No.

112
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,583
Don't think about that. I'll
get her rhythm down, I have to.

113
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,208
She looks like
a sleeping angel.

114
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,916
Hey! How did you get out?

115
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,541
Let's just say I was
exceptionally motivated.

116
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:44,458
The Tower. It means you
should expect the unexpected.

117
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,000
You mean like having Layla
come over for a surprise visit?

118
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,583
Huh. I'm good, aren't I?

119
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,291
Whatever. Just try not
to wake her up, okay?

120
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,250
Layla's movements.

121
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,958
Layla's pauses.

122
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,625
Layla's inner rhythms.

123
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,375
I've got to learn it.

124
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,291
I don't have a minute to lose!

125
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,083
They're spending all their
time together and they still

126
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,791
can't get in synch.

127
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,416
Late!

128
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm sorry--

129
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,416
That's interesting.

130
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,416
I think those two are finally
getting on the same wavelength.

131
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,458
Sora's really been
giving it her all.

132
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,541
They're finally
starting to work together.

133
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,500
Their early scenes
are starting to fly.

134
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,333
But will all that momentum stall
once they get to the climax?

135
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,458
Jump!

136
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,916
I was too close!

137
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,500
Sure, I think
we can open on time.

138
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,333
However, I think we
should tone down the climax,

139
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,666
or else this whole show's
gonna blow up in our faces.

140
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,666
So you're saying you want
to make the fight scene easy?

141
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,666
Yes. For the time being, I think
we should cut the diabolo.

142
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,541
It just keeps
getting in the way.

143
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,750
What--

144
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,625
Breaking in a newcomer
is enough of a risk.

145
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,708
I don't want anyone
to get hurt up there.

146
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,208
As the director, I think this
is our only option right now.

147
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,375
But I can do it.
I've worked so hard--

148
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,375
I know you have, Sora.
But we're running out of time.

149
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,708
Unacceptable.

150
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,208
But, Layla, I'm only--

151
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,541
We can't hold back
on the climax.

152
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,375
The show'll fall apart.
All we need is one more day.

153
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,875
But tomorrow's the final dress!

154
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,041
We can't move that.

155
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
Are you saying we
postpone opening night?

156
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,916
We'll use stand-ins
for the final dress.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you serious?

158
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,375
Afraid so.

159
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,625
You won't be sorry, Kalos.

160
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,625
Sora?

161
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,791
Hey, Ken.

162
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,291
Where's Layla?

163
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,208
She said she needed to go
and make a couple phone calls.

164
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,208
So... What did they say?

165
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,750
Oh, well Layla kind of convinced
them to give us one more day.

166
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,291
Really? That's great!

167
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,291
I know, isn't it? See ya...

168
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:35,166
Oh, right. You're gonna
be awesome out there, Sora!

169
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,541
Thanks!

170
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,958
Good morning. Is it ready?

171
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,083
It's good to see you
this morning, Miss Hamilton.

172
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,416
Everything should be in order.

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,333
I appreciate it.

174
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,250
What is...

175
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,791
Hurry and get on the boat, Sora.

176
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,208
Coming!

177
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,916
And it looks like the weather's
going to cooperate, too.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,166
I think you're right.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,166
Those clouds
don't look good at all.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,958
Excuse me, but ...

181
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,291
We're going to
practice out here.

182
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,541
What?

183
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,458
Uh Layla I know our timing
was starting to get much more

184
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,000
synchronized but is it safe
to do this over the water?

185
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,458
I want you to forget everything
you've learned up to this point.

186
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,833
Huh?

187
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,375
We've been beating our heads
against this routine,

188
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,000
trying to make every single move
perfect, but then I realized

189
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,250
having the fight be
perfect isn't enough.

190
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
It's the same kind of
safe choice I've been making

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,458
on stage for years.

192
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,875
What are you saying?

193
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,916
This has to be a real fight
between the two of us.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,958
A real fight?
Between me and Layla?

195
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,125
So, what?
Will you do it or not?

196
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,708
Yes.

197
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,750
You can use a
lifeline if you want.

198
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm not using one because it'll
just get in the way when I move.

199
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,791
Then I won't use one, either.

200
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,708
Fine.

201
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,000
You're starting to look
like you could be

202
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,833
a real adversary...

203
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,041
She's really serious about
this. If I drop my guard

204
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,500
for one second, she's gonna
toss me into the ocean!

205
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,416
Make that mistake again
and you're gonna be shark bait.

206
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,625
Out on the ocean,
she can't predict

207
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,000
when the next wave's gonna
come. So out here, Layla's...

208
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,375
Mm-hm. You heard me right.
They're in the middle of

209
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,458
a special rehearsal. I suggest
you have the final dress

210
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,000
without them.

211
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,500
I assure you, the show will open
tomorrow as scheduled. Yes.

212
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,000
No, Sarah,
it's not time for you yet.

213
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,916
I'm so sorry! I can't
believe I did that again...

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,625
That's nice. Make sure
you stay evenly spaced, folks!

215
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,291
Rick? Right about now
you need to make your way

216
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,750
to the front for your ad-lib.

217
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,916
Okay!

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
They're doing what?

219
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,458
But we're opening tomorrow--
what if they get hurt out there?

220
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,750
Layla would never do anything
to jeopardize a production.

221
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,291
But I am worried
about the weather.

222
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,166
They're like machines...

223
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,041
Are you ready to give up yet?

224
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,541
No way.

225
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,083
Oh, really?

226
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,250
Stop freaking out!

227
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,458
We just need you

228
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,583
to stay up there
'til we get the lights set.

229
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay.

230
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,666
I don't know what
Kalos is thinking;

231
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,625
there's no way we
can open tomorrow...

232
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
No, Miss Hamilton!

233
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,000
You still in one piece?

234
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,083
Yeah!

235
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,625
I radioed the docks, and the
storm's even worse out there.

236
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,875
We'll be better off staying
out here until morning.

237
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,625
If you think it's best, okay.

238
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
Tomorrow we're doing
the show for real, huh?

239
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,833
Doing it for real...

240
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,250
What?

241
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,708
I wonder if Jean could
add some rain to the effects.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,583
You know, you're
really incredible, Layla.

243
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,791
You're always thinking

244
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,666
of ways to make
Kaleido Stage shows better.

245
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,625
Do you mind if I ask why
you joined Kaleido Stage

246
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,500
in the first place?

247
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,916
When I was a little girl

248
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,166
I came to see one of
their shows with my parents.

249
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,958
It was wonderful, of course,
like a beautiful dream.

250
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,750
But the thing I liked
best about it was that

251
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,166
for the first time in my
life I could see my parents

252
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,041
laughing like children.

253
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,250
Really? Which show
did they take you to?

254
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,791
The show was
'Alice in Wonderland.'

255
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,666
'Alice in Wonderland?'

256
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,625
That's the one I saw with
my parents before they died.

257
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,333
It's one of my
favorite memories.

258
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,291
Because, seeing that
production was the last thing

259
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,500
my parents and I
ever did together.

260
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,958
It was the same way for me.

261
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,791
My mother had been sick.

262
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,958
That day was the first time
I ever heard her laugh so loud.

263
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,791
Unfortunately,
it was also the last time.

264
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,333
After she died,

265
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,291
my father tried to forget by
throwing himself into his work.

266
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,958
Wouldn't it be nice
if your father could see you

267
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,750
perform in this show?

268
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,125
I'm sorry, did I say
something I shouldn't have?

269
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,458
No.

270
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,625
I've never told anyone
about my family before.

271
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,958
It's almost like
she's got the power

272
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,333
to change people's hearts...

273
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,875
I think that one of these days
audiences are gonna flock here

274
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,208
just to see what she's up to.

275
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,625
We should try to get some rest.

276
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay.

277
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,750
Oh, by the way, Sora,

278
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,000
are you aware that
you talk in your sleep?

279
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,708
Huh? No, I didn't know.

280
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,625
I wonder if she just heard me
talking to the Fool at night...

281
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,958
What's this?!

282
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,291
Looks like both of them

283
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,125
decided to spend the night
someplace else tonight.

284
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,833
How could they?!
Why wasn't I informed?!

285
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,083
Maybe they just got
held up somewhere...

286
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,083
Yes. That must be it.

287
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,916
I have no choice.
I'm staying put.

288
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,041
But, please, make sure
you're back by tomorrow night...

289
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,291
Kalos here. Hm.
I see. All right.

290
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,791
It's Kalos. We're going on
with opening night as planned.

291
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,250
Layla and Sora are on their way
to the theatre as we speak.

292
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,375
They should be arriving
any minute now!

293
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,875
Let's move.

294
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,250
So they've heard from Sora?

295
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,875
I'm glad. Looks like
they'll make it just in time!

296
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,250
It's them!

297
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,125
Sora!

298
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
Welcome back!

299
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,458
Jean, could you make it rain
during the fight scene?

300
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,958
Rain? Well, I could try...
I need my crew!

301
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,208
Welcome back!

302
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,875
It's good to be here!

303
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,291
She's faster than
she was yesterday.

304
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,291
Sweet...

305
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,416
All right, stand by
for flame ignition.

306
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,291
Okay, go.

307
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,208
Ignite them now.

308
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,750
Go on the flames.

309
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,000
Sora!

310
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,958
Thank you, Layla.

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,250
It's been a really long time

312
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,458
since I've heard the
audience applaud like this.

313
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,625
I'm so happy.
I don't know what to say.

314
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,958
I don't want this moment
to ever end!

315
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,791
This isn't so easy that

316
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,833
you'll get a standing ovation
for just following the script.

317
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:47,083
And so I've gotta keep working
hard. Even on my days off!

318
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,875
Sora's been asked
to be a guest performer

319
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,333
at another circus company.

320
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,291
And I'm going to look
after her while she's there.

321
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,541
And just when I'd gotten used

322
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,583
to how things worked
at Kaleido Stage...

323
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,791
I feel like I'm jumping out of
the frying pan into the fire!

324
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,250
Ouch!

325
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,000
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'Mysterious Amazing Circus.'

326
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,458
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
