1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,791
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,166
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,458
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, well, well,

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,208
have your friends ever asked
you to do something for them?

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:36,250
When you see someone you
care about having a hard time,

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,708
you just can't
turn away, can you?

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,250
I know that I was only able to
get this far at Kaleido Stage

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,625
because lots of
people helped me out.

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,291
Now it's my turn to help.

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,791
Oh, Rosetta, please
don't look so sad.

12
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,000
It'll be all right.

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,083
Don't worry. Let me handle this!

14
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,500
It's my turn to help
you this time, okay?

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,208
Okay? Okay?

16
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,375
"The Amazing Newcomer."

17
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,333
I hate it!

18
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,125
I want you to
teach it right now!

19
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,916
You mustn't be impatient.
I simply can't--

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,625
I can't stand it
for another second!

21
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,125
Don't be so irritated, May.
Why don't you give this a try?

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,250
Since you're from China,

23
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,875
I bet you probably
know all about this,

24
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,083
the Cat's Paw style
of martials arts.

25
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,541
I don't know any
phony martial arts!

26
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,000
Phony?

27
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,625
I can't ignore
what you just said!

28
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,708
--Never mind that.
--Never mind that?!

29
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,208
Hold on!
If what you said is true,

30
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,958
what about my week-long
correspondence course?

31
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,333
How should I know?

32
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,375
Oh, I'm so irresponsible.

33
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,125
I don't have anything
to do with that!

34
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,166
I can not believe this.
I'm gobsmacked.

35
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,166
Anyway, do something
about this right away!

36
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,500
Now, now, now, both of you.

37
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,666
I refuse to live in the
room underneath Sora's.

38
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,875
Since I'm going to be
a big star one day,

39
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,500
it's not right that I should
have to live under her room.

40
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,666
So please, change my
dorm room right now.

41
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,833
--She's unbelievable.
--Now! Now! Now!

42
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,333
I'm the one who's supposed
to unite Kaleido Stage,

43
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
now that Layla
isn't here anymore.

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,458
But Layla was really
different from you.

45
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,500
Mia's right, you're not gonna
get anywhere by overdoing it.

46
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,083
I got it!

47
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,708
I'll throw a party!

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,958
You'll throw a party?

49
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,375
Yeah, a welcoming party!

50
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,500
We can invite
Mr. Oswald and May,

51
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,041
and if they have fun, I'm sure
they'll be friendlier.

52
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,333
But what if they don't have fun?

53
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,458
Oh no.

54
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,791
No, it'll be all right.

55
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,583
Yeah! I'm gonna go talk to Sarah
about it in a little while.

56
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,875
How could she come up with
hosting a welcoming party

57
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,166
after what May just
said to her down there?

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,333
If I were gonna be a gag
character, I'd be Sora.

59
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,541
Do you really wanna
be a gag character?

60
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,708
Of course.

61
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,333
Of course I'll need
a cake, and then--

62
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,916
Was there a break-in?

63
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,458
It sounds like
someone's in the shower.

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,333
But would a burglar use the
shower in the middle of a job?

65
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,000
Fool!

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,750
It all happened
so quickly, Sora.

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,625
I missed my chance.

68
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,250
Ah, she's coming.

69
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,583
I'm not sure what's
going on here,

70
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,166
but I'm getting you
out of the way.

71
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,333
Leave me alone, I want to see.

72
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,666
Oh my! Rosetta!

73
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,083
Oh, Sora! Welcome back.

74
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
But I-I live here.

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,208
I borrowed your shirt.

76
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,958
What are you doing
out here in the dark?

77
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,541
Oh, I... nothing.

78
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:37,083
I guess I should ask you
what you're doing in my room.

79
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,333
You've got to help me!

80
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,916
So your agent is after you?

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,541
That's right... because
I told her that I wanted

82
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,333
to come back to Kaleido Stage
and perform with you again.

83
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,125
What?

84
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,208
It's true.

85
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,916
But my agent is such a blockhead

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,791
that she refused to listen
to what I had to say.

87
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,291
You came here to
join Kaleido Stage?

88
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,333
Yes. I had to.

89
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,583
After I saw you and Layla do
the legendary great maneuver,

90
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,916
I was so moved.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,250
And I thought,

92
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,000
"I wanna hear that kind of
amazing applause for me,

93
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,291
one day, too." I need it, Sora.

94
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,791
And that's why...

95
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,583
it's impossible for me to
go back to my agent ever again.

96
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,958
Oh please, Sora,
will you please help me?

97
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,458
Rosetta, I'll do anything
I can to help you out,

98
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,916
since you've helped me
so much in the past, but...

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,750
If my agent finds me,
she's going to punish me.

100
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,375
What? She's gonna
punish you how?

101
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,958
Uh, that is...

102
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,541
You mean, like she'll give
you ten lashes or something?

103
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,416
Not ten, she'd
give me a thousand!

104
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,083
A thousand!

105
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,708
Anyway, you're the only person
I can depend on right now.

106
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,500
Hmm.

107
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm so glad.

108
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,250
And I'll help you out by
cleaning and doing laundry,

109
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,000
so if you need me to do
anything, just ask me okay?

110
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,458
Okay.

111
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,500
Right's clear,
left's clear, the front...

112
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,750
So, uh, you were able to
switch rooms after all!

113
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,333
Once I have my welcome party,
we're all gonna get along.

114
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,625
We are! We are!

115
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,291
When she's asleep, she looks
like a normal little girl,

116
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,583
not some kind of
diabolo prodigy.

117
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,833
I have to make sure
I keep her safe.

118
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,041
Stars have appeared that
will affect Sora's sign.

119
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,166
There are so many
bright new players,

120
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,291
they almost outshine her
hopes for the future.

121
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,166
She has difficult times ahead.

122
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,125
But then again, the path
to being a Kaleido Star

123
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,833
has always been an arduous one.

124
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,083
How'd I get down here?

125
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,083
Oh, May!

126
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,083
Get in the elevator!
Shut, shut, shut!

127
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,625
Sora, you're amazing!

128
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,625
You're eating enough for two!

129
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,916
I just... woke up really
hungry this morning.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,750
Well I'm gonna triple
Sora's portions.

131
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,375
Well, I just think I'll
eat in my room today.

132
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,416
That's probably a good idea.

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,666
--Bye.
--Bye.

134
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,291
Oh yeah, you guys,
I'm having a welcoming party

135
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,250
in my room tonight,
so please come.

136
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,166
--Did she say "welcoming party"?
--Hey, I want you to come, too.

137
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,208
I can't wait!

138
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,500
Right, hope to see you there!

139
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,375
Kaleido Star.

140
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,666
Amazing! Amazing!

141
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,125
All right.

142
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,333
Welcome back, Sora.

143
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,375
Sorry to keep you waiting,
now let's eat.

144
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,583
Oh, I tried to do some dishes.

145
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,833
I-I see.

146
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,875
I hope you didn't hurt yourself.

147
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,875
Then I tried to clean
the place up a bit.

148
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,250
Oh, thanks.

149
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,125
And then I tried to
replace a light bulb.

150
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,000
--I can see that.
--I'm really sorry.

151
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,833
Hey, Sora.

152
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,375
Please help me.
I'm trapped in here.

153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,958
I wasn't paying attention,
and I got sucked in.

154
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,166
It's, uh, kind of embarrassing,

155
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,541
so uh, you'll help
me out, right?

156
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,958
I think it's time for
breakfast, don't you?

157
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,541
Hey, Sora, how did it feel to do
the legendary great maneuver?

158
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,708
--How did it feel?
--Yeah...

159
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,541
Weren't you kinda scared?

160
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,208
No, not at all.

161
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,583
I mean, during practice
I worried a lot.

162
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,083
And I got really nervous, but...

163
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,166
I was okay, 'cause
I was with Layla.

164
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,458
Can I tell you something?

165
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,916
I want to be a trapeze
artist, just like you.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,458
What?

167
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,458
Are you serious, Rosetta?

168
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,250
Mhmm.

169
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,666
Hold on, I don't think we can
make those changes right now.

170
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,208
If you increase my stage time,

171
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,916
the quality of this
production will go up.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Mr. Oswald,
Sora is your partner.

173
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,875
Why are you doing this?

174
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,041
I'm not asking to
eliminate her completely.

175
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,250
But she'd only be on
stage five minutes.

176
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,666
And I'm telling
you that right now,

177
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,541
that's all the time she's worth.

178
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,416
If she doesn't like it, she
doesn't have to be in the show.

179
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,125
Leon's suggestion is reasonable.

180
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,583
Do what he says.

181
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,750
Right.

182
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,041
In exchange for that,

183
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,583
will you promise
never to walk out

184
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,583
in the middle of a show again?

185
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,291
I cannot guarantee you that.

186
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,083
But...

187
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,708
Well, I'm going.

188
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,250
Right, good luck today.

189
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,916
And, uh, promise not to take
any more baths or showers

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,583
while I'm gone, okay?

191
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,375
Uh, I promise.

192
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,125
Now that was uncalled for.

193
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,000
Hi, Kaleido Stage.

194
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,125
No way!

195
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,458
Sorry, Sora, we didn't
have any other options.

196
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,541
Most of the ensemble routines
have been shortened as well.

197
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,833
This is turning into
Leon's one-man show.

198
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,291
These are Mr. Oswald's
instructions?

199
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,708
Yes.

200
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,125
I understand how
you feel about this,

201
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,666
but right now Kaleido Stage

202
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,041
really needs a star
like Leon Oswald, so...

203
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,875
Hey, it's alright.

204
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,625
Let's stop moping and do our
best to make the show exciting!

205
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,833
Yeah!

206
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,208
You're right!

207
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,208
Everyone here is gonna do their
best out on that stage today.

208
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,791
That's great, but there's only
one thing I ask of you people.

209
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,000
Do not get in my way.

210
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,291
That is my one request.

211
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,666
You said Rosetta?

212
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,916
Yes.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,833
I haven't heard anything
about her coming here.

214
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,208
I figured as much.

215
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,500
Well, if you do hear
something, give me a call.

216
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,083
I certainly will.

217
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:02,208
By the way, Sora's performances
don't seem very lively lately.

218
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,875
So you've noticed it, too?

219
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,291
After all, I'm Sora's
first and biggest fan.

220
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:11,041
I know that losing Layla must
have been really hard for her.

221
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,125
I hope this new guy
you've got in the company

222
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,208
turns out to be a good
partner for Sora.

223
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,125
Ahh!

224
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,875
Hmm?

225
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,916
By any chance,
are you able to see me?

226
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,041
I am called the Fool.
I'm the spirit of the stage.

227
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,583
The chosen few who can see me

228
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:53,000
are destined to become
truly great performers.

229
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,958
As I have already found
those who could perform

230
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,791
the legendary great maneuver,

231
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,125
my new task is to find someone
who will be a real star--

232
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,041
Oh, I can't wait
to try the trapeze!

233
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,500
So she can't see me after all.

234
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,250
We only have one matinee
performance today,

235
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,666
so why don't you and I go
see the boss after that?

236
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,541
I wonder if I could go see a
little bit of Sora's show today.

237
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,958
Huh, the practice rooms...

238
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,583
I wonder what people
are practicing.

239
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,875
Absolutely wonderful! You're
very impressive, May Wong.

240
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,208
Of course I am!

241
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,791
Oh, and so confident!

242
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,166
Instructor, please tell
me you'll let me appear

243
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,291
in a real performance
sometime soon?

244
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,083
What?

245
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,458
To be frank with you,

246
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,125
I'm much more talented
than Sora Naegino ever was.

247
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,166
I think you should hurry up
and kick her off the stage

248
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
and make me your
new leading lady.

249
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,000
I think everyone should
just admit the truth.

250
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,375
I, for one, feel sorry
for Leon Oswald,

251
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,666
having that amateur
as a partner.

252
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,625
Kaleido Stage doesn't need
a loser like Sora Naegino.

253
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,500
Don't you agree?

254
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,958
Why?

255
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,875
What gives you the right to
talk about Sora like that?

256
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,958
Who are-

257
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,208
You have no idea
what she's capable of.

258
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,375
Oh, I know what
her abilities are.

259
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,000
But they're no match for
the kind of talent I have.

260
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,875
My friend Sora's amazing,

261
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,458
but I wouldn't expect someone
like you to know that.

262
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,375
Huh? Aren't you that Rosetta?

263
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,083
--Rosetta? The diabolo girl?
--Uh, no!

264
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,833
I didn't recognize you.

265
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,541
You may be a genius
at diabolo, Rosetta,

266
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,500
but this is a
Kaleido Stage matter,

267
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,791
and it's not your concern!

268
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,625
Rosetta?

269
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,625
Oh, good, it is you.

270
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,375
Hey, your agent's
looking for you.

271
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,458
Give her a call and let
her know where you are.

272
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,083
You're still not fit
to be my partner.

273
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,875
So I'll be reducing
your role even further

274
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,416
for tomorrow's show.

275
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,375
Right.

276
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,458
This isn't how Kaleido Stage
is supposed to be.

277
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,625
I wonder if we can continue
to create productions

278
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,500
with someone like this.

279
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,541
Leon looked so great.

280
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,875
I'm coming back tomorrow.

281
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,458
I just saw her run into
Kaleido Stage, over.

282
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,000
Thank you.

283
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,541
Hmm?

284
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,291
I'm sorry Rosetta
has imposed on you.

285
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,875
Not at all.

286
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:12,291
But I wonder why she decided to
come out here to Kaleido Stage.

287
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,875
Me too.

288
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,000
Rosetta! Rosetta!

289
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,458
Hey, Rosetta!

290
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,750
Rosetta?

291
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,666
That's right, Sora,
she just ran through here.

292
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,541
This way!

293
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,833
Rosetta!

294
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,291
The agent who'll give
her a thousand lashes!

295
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,166
Where'd she go?

296
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,833
She ran this way.

297
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,083
Rosetta!

298
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,375
Rosetta, get down here!

299
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,916
I won't, now go!

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,333
Rosetta, enough!

301
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,791
Wait a minute!

302
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,208
Listen to what
Rosetta has to say.

303
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,708
She wants to become a
member of Kaleido Stage.

304
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,916
She what?

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,375
I'm ending the contract
with my agent.

306
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
You can pay me a
newcomer's salary,

307
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,250
so Kalos, what do you say?

308
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,708
Yeah, that sounds great.

309
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,041
Well, I'm not going to
let you have your way.

310
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,416
We should take her
wishes into cons-

311
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,041
You won't be able to do
this on your own, you know.

312
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,833
I'm not a little
kid anymore, Mama.

313
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,041
Mama?

314
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,750
Can't you just listen to me?

315
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,875
You don't understand.

316
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:43,250
This place means a lot more
to me than I think you know.

317
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,416
I used to think that
perfecting a routine

318
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,416
was the most important thing,

319
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
but they taught me
that a good performance

320
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,875
is something you create
with an audience.

321
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,875
I was able to get back
the feelings I had

322
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,416
when I first started
doing diabolo.

323
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,041
And that's not all!

324
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,416
After I saw Sora and Layla do
the legendary great maneuver,

325
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,541
I felt like something
inside of me had opened up.

326
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,916
I want to be able to do that
kind of amazing show, too.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,750
That's all I can think
about, all day long.

328
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't stay quiet anymore.

329
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,250
Rosetta.

330
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,083
This time, I wanna become
like someone else.

331
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,625
I wanna be the one who
performs on stage with Sora.

332
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,583
I can even swing, watch me!

333
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,916
Rosetta!

334
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,666
Rosetta!

335
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,791
Rosetta!

336
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,916
Sora!

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
You're too reckless, Rosetta.

338
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,125
Sorry.

339
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,208
We're going back.

340
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,875
Okay.

341
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,250
My Rosetta. She's laughing.

342
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,791
Ta-da!

343
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,666
Thanks a lot, Sora.

344
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,250
Rosetta, I am afraid
of one thing, Rosetta.

345
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,500
That you're going to turn
into a machine all over again,

346
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,166
just like you did with diabolo.

347
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,916
You're very tough on yourself.

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,791
I know I was the one who trained
you hard when you were little,

349
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,500
but then, once you became

350
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,500
the youngest world
champion in history,

351
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,583
you aimed for even
more perfection,

352
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,083
and then you
developed a tendency

353
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,375
to drive yourself into corners.

354
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,875
Mama.

355
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,208
It's so tough to keep
watching you do that.

356
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,333
I'm the one who taught
you to be the very best.

357
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,208
But if you put yourself
back in that frame of mind,

358
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,875
I'm sure that you'll...

359
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,458
Mama.

360
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,291
It's true. When I
was a little girl,

361
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,500
you could be strict and
sometimes a little bit scary,

362
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,375
but I'm still really glad
that you taught me diabolo.

363
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,791
Don't worry, Mama.

364
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,958
I won't turn into a
machine again, I promise.

365
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,166
This'll be some hard training.

366
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,833
She'll go through
all kinds of feelings

367
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,458
and may even want
to cry sometimes.

368
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,125
She won't have time
to be a machine.

369
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,750
You're right.

370
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,750
After all, Kaleido
Stage is the place

371
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,416
that helped you
regain your smile.

372
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,958
Mr. Kalos, may I entrust
Rosetta to your care?

373
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,000
Of course you can.

374
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,708
But if she performs
diabolo for you,

375
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,166
I expect you to pay
her regular rate.

376
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,916
Huh? Right.

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,750
So does that mean you're going
to let me stay here, Mama?

378
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,291
Yes, you can stay here.

379
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,791
We did it!

380
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,916
Listen, I've got a ton of other
clients to attend to now,

381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,416
so I'm going.

382
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,583
Call me if you need anything.

383
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,250
Mama.

384
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,000
I love you a lot, Mama!

385
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,166
That is so sweet.

386
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Welcome to Kaleido Stage!

387
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,250
It's nice to meet you.

388
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,125
Hey, where's Sora?

389
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,291
She was just here a minute ago.

390
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,583
I saw her leave
with a piece of cake.

391
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,958
Who cares about
the welcome party?

392
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,750
I thought you might
want a piece of-

393
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,041
It doesn't matter which one.

394
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,291
Just satisfy me.

395
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,625
And so, Mia's new idea
for a show is 'Dracula!'

396
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,416
It's scary, but it's also
a passionate love story.

397
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,958
But May made a big fuss again,

398
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,166
saying that she deserved
to be Leon's partner.

399
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,750
There's only one day
left until the deadline.

400
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,000
Layla entrusted me
with her dream,

401
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,041
and I will never be
defeated. Never! Never!

402
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,708
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'The Amazing Passionate Rival.'

403
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,875
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky!
