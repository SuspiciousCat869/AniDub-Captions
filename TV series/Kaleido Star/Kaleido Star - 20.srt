1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi, everyone, Kaleido Star
is about to start,

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,708
so make sure that your room is
brightly lit and that you're not

3
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,875
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,500
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,625
Have you ever made
something with your friends?

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,166
Sure, it can be
hard work getting

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,791
a bunch of people organized,
but when you all put your heads

8
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,666
together you can come up with
some really amazing things.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,333
Just like our new show!

10
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm really proud
of how it turned out.

11
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,916
So, you gonna come see it?
Are you? Are you? Are you?!

12
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,583
It's amazing how quickly
time passes, isn't it?

13
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,250
I know, I can't believe
it's already been two weeks

14
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,708
since we moved in.

15
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,583
Two whole weeks! And in all
that time, we haven't done

16
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,750
any work on our company
or found day jobs.

17
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,708
I know I told my Mom
and Dad not to worry,

18
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,250
but now I don't know...

19
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,750
Oh, I wish we had a bigger
place to practice in.

20
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,166
I know.

21
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,666
I just wish our dreams
would hurry up and come true.

22
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,666
Don't worry. It'll happen, Sora.

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,125
Right. Like mine just did.

24
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,791
You all right, Sora?

25
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,083
I was just thinking maybe we
could stage a pillow fight

26
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,583
up on the tight rope.

27
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,333
Uh but seriously Mia, Anna,

28
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,333
please don't go flashing your
underwear around here, okay?

29
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,083
We're all girls. Who cares?

30
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,458
Yeah.

31
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,791
No! Anna what if there's
a peeping Tom at the window?

32
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,291
Or some lecherous spirit
in here watching us?

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,500
Hey what did you just call me?

34
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,250
'An Amazing Change
From Zero To Hero.'

35
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,958
I almost forgot that Yuri's
first show at Kaleido Stage

36
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,208
was going to open today.

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,333
What do you think?
Should we go?

38
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,500
I still can't believe
he sent us all an invitation.

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,166
That was strange.

40
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,000
It's like he's
daring us to come.

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,958
So... should we?

42
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:46,541
Welcome one and all to the
rebirth of Kaleido Stage.

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,375
Today you will see things you
never dreamed were possible.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,791
Before your eyes, the phoenix
will rise from the ashes.

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,291
He spent a lot on this show.

46
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,166
I knew it. He just
invited us to gloat.

47
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,125
I performed opposite
Layla on that stage.

48
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,458
We made shows where

49
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,291
everyone pushed themselves
to do their very best.

50
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,583
But I guess that kind of Kaleido
Stage doesn't exist anymore...

51
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,416
What's wrong, Sora?

52
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,250
Are you looking
for someone down there?

53
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh. I was just wondering

54
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,916
if Layla might've come here
to see the show today, too.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
Yeah she might...

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,125
Yuri probably sent her
an invitation, too.

57
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,291
But I'll bet she was
too busy to come.

58
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,750
I read in a magazine that
she's filming another movie.

59
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,666
Guess she won't
do shows anymore...

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,916
That can't be true! She's too
good to stop performing.

61
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,291
Look, it's Yuri.

62
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,166
Mister Yuri?
Could you sign this for me?

63
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,041
Sure.

64
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,750
Will you sign my program, too?

65
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,750
I would be honored to.

66
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,333
Uh do you guys know why
we're hiding down here?

67
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,666
No...

68
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,791
How about we rent the
Empire Stage for a few days?

69
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,458
It's only three hundred
and fifty per show.

70
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,458
Then we've only got
enough money for three shows.

71
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,791
We've got to find
someplace cheaper.

72
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
If we can't have a space for at
least ten days there's almost

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,000
no point in doing a show there.

74
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,041
You're right.

75
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,333
Hey!

76
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,916
Did you find someplace?

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,416
'Wanted: three acrobats to
perform at the grand opening

78
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,958
of a seafood restaurant.

79
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,458
Applicants must audition.'
They pay pretty well, too!

80
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,208
Wow that's perfect!

81
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,333
But what'll we do
for the audition?

82
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,000
We'll think of something.

83
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,625
Right. Getting this job's
gonna be a piece of cake.

84
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,958
Yeah!

85
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,333
This is it.

86
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,875
Come on let's go get a job.

87
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,166
Let's do it.

88
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,541
You want to hire us! Yes!

89
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,416
Yes!

90
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,666
Yes!

91
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,458
You got yourself a job!

92
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,375
All right!

93
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,666
Welcome to the Seaside.

94
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,250
If we're just here
to hand out balloons

95
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,208
and wear these costumes,
why'd he have us audition?

96
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,500
At least you got
the crab costume.

97
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,041
That's way funnier
than a shrimp any day.

98
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,208
I know. But this is our job, so
we've gotta do our best, right?

99
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,500
Right.

100
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,708
Welcome to the
Seaside, everyone!

101
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,875
Mia!

102
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,083
Right.

103
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,791
One for you, one for you,
one for you, one for you.

104
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,458
I thought that I'd made
myself perfectly clear.

105
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,625
You're to stand out there
and hand out balloons--

106
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,625
if they like you too much
they won't want to eat seafood.

107
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,666
Yes, sir...

108
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,833
Come right in...

109
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,416
...and have yourself...

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,916
...some tasty...

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
...seafood!

112
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,791
Look, from now on no talking.
Just hand out balloons to

113
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,333
the people as they walk by.

114
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,500
Yes, sir...

115
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,750
Why'd he even bother
having us audition?

116
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,916
Come on, we've gotta
keep smiling, Mia.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,416
I'm taking a break,
hold down those balloons.

118
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,416
What's she upset about?

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,916
At least she got
to wear the crab.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,583
It's humiliating
being a shrimp.

121
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,375
Smile. Anna, come on...

122
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:04,416
We've been smiling.
So much my face hurts...

123
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,291
Come have some
delicious seafood!

124
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,458
Yuri.

125
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:18,833
No way!

126
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,291
What what are you doing?

127
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,375
Um well, we're...

128
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:45,083
Hey, I'm sorry. You just look so
ridiculous in those costumes.

129
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,125
Sora...

130
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,291
Oh no, Mr. Killian!
You're not injured, are you?

131
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
No, just caught off guard.

132
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,916
Please accept my apologies.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,541
I've reserved you
a special table inside.

134
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,583
Please, follow me, Mr. Killian.

135
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,416
You're fired.

136
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,958
Last person I'd want to see

137
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,083
when I'm dressed in
a crab costume is Yuri.

138
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,500
You don't know

139
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,791
what real humiliation is
until you dress like a shrimp.

140
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah?

141
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,375
Who-- Who's there?

142
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm back!

143
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,458
Miss Sarah?!

144
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,750
I asked your friend the
Policeman and he told me

145
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,500
this is where you live now.

146
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,333
So here I am.

147
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,041
This is a lovely place!

148
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
Did you finish your
training already?

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,291
Yep and I can sumo wrestle
with the best of them now.

150
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,333
I thought the training
was for your singing.

151
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,375
Heavens no! Where's the fun in
that? I think sumo's brilliant.

152
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,750
You should all come with
me sometime for a seminar.

153
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,333
But Sarah, shouldn't you be
seeing how the Boss is doing?

154
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,708
What? Is something wrong
with Kalos? You must tell me.

155
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,000
We just figured
you know well...

156
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,500
You know, I haven't
heard anything from Kalos

157
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,875
in more than a fortnight...

158
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,458
What?!

159
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,125
I think he's taking some time
alone to see what he wants to do

160
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,708
with his life now.

161
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,708
Why hasn't he talked to you?
Aren't you worried about that?

162
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,375
Worried?

163
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,708
That he's faithful.

164
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,125
Oh, I don't need
to worry about that.

165
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,000
After Sora's little trick at
Kaleido Stage, I feel pretty

166
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,416
secure Kalos is still head
over heels in love with me.

167
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,416
Right...

168
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,250
And by the way, I found
a you job if you're interested.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,916
Good! Here it is.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,416
It says they're looking for
performers at Marine Park?!

171
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,000
I just happened upon this
flyer when I was in town.

172
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,041
And I thought 'what have we
got to lose,' so I talked to

173
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,208
the owner of the Marine Park
and set everything up.

174
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,250
But we're only booked for one
day -- the day after tomorrow.

175
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,625
The day after tomorrow?

176
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,875
Sorry, girls, it was
the best I could do.

177
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,416
They usually have a band
that plays on that stage,

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,291
but that day they're going to
be off so we're going to be on.

179
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,708
And one more thing:

180
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,625
they're going to clear
the set tomorrow night,

181
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,666
so we won't have a chance
to rehearse on the stage.

182
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,000
Well?

183
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,125
I can't wait to
perform again. Well?

184
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,125
Yeah. We should do it, it's not
like we have any other offers.

185
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,458
And if they like the company,

186
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,291
maybe we can work for them
on a long-term basis.

187
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,041
Thanks a lot, Sarah!

188
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,291
I'm so glad this
worked out for everyone.

189
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,125
You should take a shower
and a nap, Sarah.

190
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,125
You must be exhausted.

191
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,250
Good idea!

192
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,875
Take your time.

193
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,458
Now, what did I do
to deserve this?

194
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,250
So, what should we do?

195
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,791
Well, we don't have much time,

196
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,125
so we probably shouldn't try
to do something with a story.

197
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,500
It'd be too elaborate...

198
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,875
Should we just work up
a couple routines, then?

199
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,500
Hey. What do you think about
calling up everyone who was

200
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,833
in 'Freedom' with us?

201
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,166
That's a great idea.

202
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,250
I'll send out an e-mail
to them right away.

203
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,666
Layla too.

204
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,583
I think we should ask Layla
if she wants to do it.

205
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,833
I don't know that
she'd be interested...

206
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,500
Yeah. But if Sora wants
to ask her, we'll ask her.

207
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,375
All right. Let's go over
to her house and see.

208
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,875
So we thought we'd get everybody
from 'Freedom' together

209
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,458
and create our
own Kaleido Stage.

210
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,875
And we'd like for you
to be a part of it, Layla.

211
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,041
I've got a screen test today
and a costume fitting tomorrow.

212
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,583
Sorry to disappoint you,

213
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,875
but I'm too busy. I wouldn't
even have the time to rehearse.

214
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,416
Besides, my Father's
handles my schedule now,

215
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,541
and he feels I should do film.

216
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,125
Are you happy with that?

217
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,208
I mean, you seem to
really love performing.

218
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:55,500
I won't disobey my Father; he
has my best interests at heart.

219
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,875
But, Layla, that doesn't
mean you're never going

220
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,666
to perform again, does it?

221
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,625
I-- I was hoping I was hoping
we'd get to star opposite

222
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,416
each other again someday.

223
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,708
Sora?

224
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,208
Yes?

225
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,666
Have you gained weight
since I saw you last?

226
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,666
You don't seem to understand
how hard it is to get yourself

227
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,666
back in shape if you let
your training slide, Sora.

228
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,458
I I guess you're right...

229
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,125
It looks like Layla isn't
going to be joining us

230
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,750
for our new show
at the marine park.

231
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,750
I hope she can be happy with
following her Father's orders.

232
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,041
Yeah.

233
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,875
And you can get this
three-volume instruction video

234
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,458
for just two hundred dollars!

235
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,958
Wow!

236
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,708
You're back already?
What did she say?

237
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,250
She's too busy, just like
we thought she would be.

238
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,750
Really?

239
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,708
Well what a pity, but I'm sure
we'll make do without her.

240
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,166
I got some
responses to my e-mail.

241
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,583
Really?

242
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,791
Yeah, from Elena, Jeanne,
Clair... Even from Emilio!

243
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,000
And they're all coming!

244
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
All right!

245
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,625
We're gonna give that park the
greatest show they ever saw!

246
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,208
I know. It's just too bad we'll
only be performing it for a day.

247
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,125
What? What?

248
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,375
And Rosetta...

249
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,291
It's been a long time.
I've read your e-mail.

250
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll go there
immediately. Rosetta

251
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,333
I sent her an invitation,

252
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,791
but I never thought
she'd be able to come.

253
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,250
Wow...

254
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,708
Well, this is it,
this is where they live...

255
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,000
What that?

256
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,166
Come on up.

257
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,333
We're trying!

258
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,875
Hey, watch where
you're stepping.

259
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,666
Quiet, everyone!

260
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,500
Yes?

261
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,250
Let's do a show!

262
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,958
Hi, guys!

263
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,291
So it's all ours. The day after
tomorrow we'll be performing

264
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,500
on the Marine Park's stage.

265
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,208
As you can tell, we don't
have a lot of time to prepare.

266
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,083
So, if any of you
have any suggestions

267
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,625
or anything you'd like to try,

268
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,333
I'd really appreciate it if you
shared that with the group.

269
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,250
You know, I stopped by
to look at the stage

270
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,916
on the way here and...

271
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,375
How's it look?

272
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,833
The ceiling's a lot lower
than I thought it would be.

273
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,833
I guess that rules out
maneuvers on the trampoline...

274
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,875
And the stage is also
kind of a weird shape:

275
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,041
it's really wide, but
it's not very deep at all.

276
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,541
So I guess that means if
everyone does end up coming

277
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,541
it'd be impossible for us
all to be on stage together

278
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,958
at the same time.

279
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,125
And Rosetta will be pretty
limited in what she can do

280
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,000
with her diabolo.

281
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,083
It's not the best
situation, is it?

282
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,000
Why can't you just take
the roof off the place?

283
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,291
Please, we're talking.

284
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,916
It's not an ideal venue,

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,916
but I guess we'll have
to make the best of it.

286
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,750
I'm sure we can alter some of
our routines to work there.

287
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,875
It may not be exactly
what we'd hoped for,

288
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,291
but at least I'll be performing
again. I'm so excited!

289
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,000
And we'll get to see Rosetta
soon, too. I can't wait!

290
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm free!

291
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,500
Great! The jumps look great!

292
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,750
Clair, Jeanne, could
you pick up your pace?

293
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,958
Sure.

294
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,708
It's good to be working again.
Don't you think so?

295
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah. But still...

296
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,166
I went to measure the
stage today and it's tiny.

297
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,750
Jean told me it was
small yesterday,

298
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,458
but I justI don't know how we're
gonna get half the cast on it.

299
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,083
I wish we could do
something really big.

300
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,458
I know, but if we did
we'd fall off the stage.

301
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,625
I know.

302
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,750
Rosetta!

303
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
--Sora!
--It's been so long!

304
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,416
I can't believe you're here!

305
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,750
We're glad you could make it
on such short notice.

306
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,666
We thought you'd be too busy.

307
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,208
Not a chance.

308
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,333
I'm never too busy for you,
Sora, 'cause I owe you too much.

309
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,708
Besides, I'd be honored to
be part of your new company!

310
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,083
Just to warn you the
stage is really small.

311
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,708
So this is gonna be tough.

312
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,958
That's okay. The Diabolo Battle
doesn't take much space.

313
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,833
The Diabolo Battle?

314
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,750
You mean, like the one
we did at Kaleido Stage?

315
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,458
That's going to be impossible.

316
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh.

317
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,541
But I thought...

318
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,750
Rosetta?

319
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,041
Well, guess I'll have to
come up with something else.

320
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,750
Thanks so much!

321
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,458
Okay, guys. Breaktime's over,
so let's get back to work.

322
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,583
Yeah!

323
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,250
What?!

324
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,000
This must be some
kind of mistake.

325
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,791
But didn't someone call you?

326
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,250
Your show's been
canceled for today.

327
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,250
Nobody told us about this.

328
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,625
Can't you do something
to cancel the cancellation?

329
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,500
But no one struck
the band's set,

330
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,375
and it's too late
to strike it now.

331
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,125
That means we have no place
for you to perform.

332
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,208
I wonder...

333
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,208
Huh?

334
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,666
Did somebody
put you up to this?

335
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,791
I'm not at liberty to --
I mean, no...

336
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,875
This has Yuri
written all over it.

337
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,458
Could be.

338
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
It looks like he's beaten us,
so we might as well go home...

339
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,416
But we can't give up
this easily can we?

340
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,708
I mean, not when
everyone came all this way.

341
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,916
Even Rosetta came to perform...

342
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,750
Why can't you just take
the roof off the place?

343
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,333
The roof... That's it!

344
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,333
You're not serious!
You are, aren't you?

345
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,750
The park's not going to pay us,

346
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,125
so none of you have to do
this if you don't want to.

347
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,583
Right.

348
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,083
Don't be stupid. I came all
this way and I'm not gonna

349
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,416
go home without performing.

350
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,708
Rosetta...

351
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,250
That goes for us, too.

352
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,541
And me.

353
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,583
Awesome!

354
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,166
Thanks, guys!

355
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,875
All right it's agreed.

356
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,916
Everything in this
amusement park is fair game

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,416
to perform on today.

358
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,916
And all the customers
are gonna be our audience.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,375
And our costumes are
what we're wearing now.

360
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,750
Then let's get this
show started. Ready?

361
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,208
Yeah!

362
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,541
Do you think that
this is gonna work?

363
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,958
I guess we'll find out.

364
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,500
The thinking man. The
running man. The falling man.

365
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,541
Well, they're not on stage... 

366
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,208
What's going on?

367
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,041
Sarah?

368
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,666
Oh, hello, Marion.

369
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,875
Uh do you mind telling me
what's going on out here?

370
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,166
They couldn't use the stage, so
they're performing out here.

371
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,000
We had a change in plans...

372
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,791
What's going on out here?!

373
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,875
Hey you people get
off of my carousel!

374
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,541
What are we gonna do,
what are we gonna do?!

375
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,958
And... up!

376
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,208
A rose?

377
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,166
It's Dio!

378
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,916
You mean the guy with the
whip from Theatrical Camp?

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,666
Yeah. I asked Mia to
send him an e-mail, too.

380
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,833
Thank you so much
for showing up, Dio!

381
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,458
I had some free time,
so I figured I'd drop by.

382
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,583
You didn't tell me
he was so good-looking!

383
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,291
It looks like it was a good
thing that we didn't have

384
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,041
to use the stage then.

385
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,333
I agree.

386
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,083
I wonder if... If the person who
canceled the show today was...

387
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,083
It was Kalos.

388
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,541
If they'd performed on
that tiny little stage

389
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,666
they never would've had
this kind of response.

390
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,416
This is just like him.

391
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,916
If only Layla could've
been here today...

392
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,750
Hey, Sora?

393
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,541
Hm?

394
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Who is that?

395
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,625
That scared the pee out of me!

396
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,041
I know...

397
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,125
But who could
who could that be?

398
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,458
That was our biggest crowd
draw since I opened this park!

399
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,916
And so, thanks to the
appearance of the masked star,

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,125
the owner of Marine Park
owner offered us a contract!

401
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,791
Not just a contract,
a long-term contract!

402
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,166
I always thought Layla was
amazing, but this person is...

403
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,500
Who is she, anyway?

404
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,500
And how can we get her
to perform with us again?

405
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,041
How, how?

406
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,750
Be sure to join us next time
for 'The Amazing Mystery Star.'

407
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,541
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
