00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,125
Hello everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,291
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,625
and that you're not sitting
too close to the television.

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,750
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,250
We've not seen each
other for a while.

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,833
It's Layla.

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,541
Did you see the legendary great
maneuver that I did with Sora?

8
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,541
I bet everything on that show,

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,708
risking my own fate
and my relationship

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,333
with the best
partner I ever had.

11
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,041
Now I'm no longer able to
perform at Kaleido Stage,

12
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,291
but I have no regrets.

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,750
Because I found a new dream.

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,875
Sora, follow me!

15
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,333
Wow, we've got a whole
week of vacation coming up!

16
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,083
Thank goodness for
annual maintenance!

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,750
Yeah, this is my chance
to make the rounds

18
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,583
at all of the comedy clubs.

19
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,375
I'll use my time off
in the library

20
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,625
to plan new productions
for us to do.

21
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,666
I'm gonna spend my days and
nights training on the trapeze.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,250
Sora, would you like to join me?

23
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,125
Huh?

24
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,375
Everyone's so motivated.

25
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,750
You will play Mina Murray.

26
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,125
Oh, yes.

27
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,833
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,916
If I stay like this, I'll never
be a real Kaleido Star.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,166
Is something wrong?

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,125
It's nothing.
It's nothing at all!

31
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm fine, you guys.
Really, I'm fine.

32
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,375
Sora, when you've finished
changing your clothes,

33
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,125
please go to the Boss' office.

34
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,333
He has a surprise for you.

35
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,708
Somehow I have a really
bad feeling about this.

36
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,625
I think you're overreacting.

37
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,833
It's not like he's never made
you work during your vacation.

38
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,250
Just in case,
you should go there

39
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,708
expecting the absolute
worst to happen.

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,875
That way the shock
won't feel so bad.

41
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,166
You can handle it, Sora!

42
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,708
Okay.

43
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,208
Huh?

44
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,166
I've been asked to appear
in a show starring Layla!

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,958
Are you serious?

46
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,375
Layla recommended you,
but it's during your vacation.

47
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,708
Should I tell them no?

48
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,208
Huh?

49
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,666
Tell 'em that I'll do it!

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll go to the North Pole!
I'll go to the South Pole!

51
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,500
I'll go anywhere.

52
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,541
Sora is going to appear
on stage with Layla?

53
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,666
I'm gonna see Layla again!

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,958
Layla!

55
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,375
"The Ever Amazing Miss Layla."

56
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,041
Excuse me, sir, I'm looking
for an off-Broadway show.

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,875
It's called "Salome in Vegas."

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,208
Follow that taxi in front of us.

59
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,833
It's Layla.

60
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,333
Sora!

61
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,791
Huh?

62
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:40,208
Well, Sora, it's been
a long time, hasn't it?

63
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,000
Layla!

64
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,750
Sora.

65
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,625
Hey!

66
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,166
Sora!

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,958
Charlotte! Julie!

68
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,541
We're working in the show as
Layla's personal assistants.

69
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:06,041
Oh wow, Sora, you like
haven't changed at all.

70
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,833
Let me present Kaleido
Stage's Sora Naegino.

71
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,625
This is our producer,
Mike Abbott.

72
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,916
Hi there.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I look forward to working
with you this week.

74
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,791
I look forward to
working with you, too!

75
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,666
And, standing up
here on the stage

76
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,708
is the writer and
director of our show.

77
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
This is Cathy Taymor.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,083
Hello there.

79
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,833
It's nice to meet
you Miss Taymor.

80
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,416
Ah!

81
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,041
Hmm, yes, I think the
costume will fit her.

82
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,166
You see, our dear Layla
fired the previous performer.

83
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,000
Uh, she was fired?

84
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,250
She was a good performer
with a respectable career.

85
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,958
But it seems Layla
didn't like her.

86
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,166
Layla fired her in the middle
of a live performance

87
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,541
without consulting the
director or the producer.

88
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,708
Is that professional behavior?

89
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,500
Uh...

90
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,291
No, it's not professional!

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,083
Cathy, I refuse
to appear on stage

92
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,833
with anyone who isn't
driven to do their best.

93
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,083
You spoiled rich girls
are such a pain.

94
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,541
Lucky for us we could book her,

95
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,416
because her schedule
happened to be open.

96
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,750
But what were you planning to do

97
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,791
if we couldn't find a
replacement for the role?

98
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,916
--Well, maybe-
--Thank you for coming, Sora.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,166
Uh, thanks.

100
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,208
But I can only appear in
your show for one week,

101
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,041
and then I have to
return to Kaleido Stage.

102
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,500
That'll be fine.

103
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,416
We'll figure out the
rest when the time comes,

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,041
so don't worry about it.

105
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,250
Oh, okay.

106
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,541
You're only in one scene,

107
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,208
but it's one of the
most important scenes

108
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,208
in the entire show.

109
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,416
This is the scene in which

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,625
Salome dances in the
back half of the stage.

111
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,916
Got it.

112
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,083
Anger and sorrow. Love and hate.

113
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,333
All of Salome's passion
is poured into this scene.

114
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,666
And I want you to fire up
those emotions by playing

115
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,000
the shadowy representation
of my character's psyche,

116
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,750
and raise the temperature
of the stage.

117
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,750
Raise the temperature.

118
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,375
Once we choreograph the rough
outline of your routine,

119
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,083
the way you perform it
will be left up to you.

120
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,083
In other words,
you're free to ad-lib.

121
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,625
You want me to ad-lib?

122
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,208
Alright Sora, let's run
through the basic outline.

123
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,625
Okay.

124
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,791
Hold on!

125
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
That sounds like...

126
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,375
It's May!

127
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,458
Who are you?

128
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,750
Hello, Layla,
my name is May Wong.

129
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,708
I've always been
inspired by you,

130
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,000
and earlier this year,
I joined Kaleido Stage

131
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,291
and scored higher
than any new entrant.

132
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,125
Why are you here?

133
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,666
This is for you.

134
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Thank you.

135
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,458
So then, you're the one
who was chosen to be

136
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,291
Leon Oswald's partner in the
new Kaleido Stage production.

137
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,875
Yes. I beat out Sora in the
competition for the role.

138
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,208
So instead of Sora,

139
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,458
you should choose me to
be your partner on stage.

140
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,833
What?

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,916
Rolling Flower!

142
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,750
How did May find out I was
invited here by Layla?

143
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:11,041
And why did she come to
New York planning to do this?

144
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,208
Shining Flower!

145
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,833
Miracle Great!

146
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,791
That's enough, May! Stop it!

147
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,958
I won't!

148
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,916
You weren't the
one invited here.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,916
So get off the stage, now!

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,333
You were invited to
appear in the show,

151
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,541
because Layla didn't know

152
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,458
that a person of my
talent was available.

153
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,541
Wow, looks like
this new hot shot

154
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,333
might be some real competition.

155
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,041
Like Sora doesn't
stand a chance.

156
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,208
Wouldn't it be
interesting to put

157
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,458
both of them on stage, Layla?

158
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,333
Both of them on stage?

159
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,750
I think that's a good idea.

160
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,916
All right, let's
start rehearsal.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,916
Yeah, that's right,
we need another costume.

162
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,916
Well?

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,583
I think the scene needs
just one more idea.

164
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,250
But we can work it out tomorrow.

165
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,166
Ladies, please come with me.

166
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,833
I was able to get you the last
room at the Century Hotel.

167
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,333
You're putting me in
the same room as Sora?!

168
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, yeah. I am.

169
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,458
I refuse!

170
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,208
May, don't be a prima donna.

171
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,875
I'd rather sleep outside

172
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,625
than have to share
the same room with you!

173
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,916
Oh yeah, well who'd
wanna stay with you?

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,458
Stop your whining!

175
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,166
You two should be saving your
energy for tomorrow's show!

176
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,791
Uh, yes ma'am.

177
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,416
Perhaps there is
another solution.

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
You could cancel the hotel
and come stay at my place.

179
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,166
Well, this is it.

180
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,208
Wow.

181
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,125
Amazing.

182
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,333
--Look at New York City.
--It's beautiful!

183
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,666
Make yourselves at home.
I'll try to make us some coffee.

184
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,541
Try to make?

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,416
Miss Layla, that's the place
where you pour in the water.

186
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,833
And the coffee beans
have to be ground first.

187
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,708
Oh, I forgot.

188
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,958
If you made coffee more often,
you'd remember how to make it.

189
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,666
Thank goodness
you're here to help me.

190
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,875
Oh, I'm so honored to be
of use to you, Miss Layla.

191
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,458
You know I always love to help.

192
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,791
Layla has started
a brand new life.

193
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,916
On a new stage, in a new city.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,833
I wonder if the
legendary great maneuver

195
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,500
is already nothing more than
a distant part of her past.

196
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,666
Wouldn't it be
interesting to put

197
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,000
both of them on stage, Layla?

198
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,000
Both of them on stage?

199
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,625
I think that's a good idea.

200
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,500
It seems that I'm not the
only one she has hopes for.

201
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,166
Sora, would you
quit moping already?

202
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,416
Moping?

203
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,291
Now that both of us are
going to be in the show,

204
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,666
you'll have to pull
yourself together

205
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,416
if you don't want to
embarrass Layla on the stage.

206
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,833
I had so many things I wanted
to talk with Layla about,

207
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,833
but it looks like I won't get
that chance because of you!

208
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,083
Layla isn't your
private property!

209
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,125
For your information,
I wanna talk to Layla, too!

210
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:59,708
And it was always my dream to
appear on the stage with her.

211
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,541
I came here so Layla would
know I'm better than you.

212
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,208
And see I can achieve things
far beyond your abilities.

213
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,500
I will not lose to a
performer so incompetent

214
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,666
that she injured Layla on stage.

215
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,458
Wait just a second.

216
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,166
Did you just say that
Sora injured me?

217
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,375
If Sora hadn't been your partner
on the legendary great maneuver,

218
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,666
I'm certain you would have
never been injured, Layla.

219
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,958
Why don't both of
you have a seat?

220
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,708
I was injured because
I wasn't concentrating

221
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,583
on what I needed to be doing.

222
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,250
Even though I
smashed my shoulder,

223
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,750
I attempted the legendary
great maneuver.

224
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,833
I did it of my own free will.

225
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,250
So it would be wrong
for you to blame Sora.

226
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,750
Of course, as a result,

227
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,875
I can no longer do
that kind of performance.

228
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,625
However, on the bright
side of things,

229
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,083
I find myself looking
at a new opportunity.

230
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,708
Layla, if you had never
injured your shoulder,

231
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,833
right now you would be in
even more spectacular shows.

232
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,625
I chose to go on stage
and perform that show.

233
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,958
What?

234
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,750
After I performed the
legendary great maneuver,

235
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,583
and people heard that
I wouldn't be able

236
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,125
to go back to Kaleido Stage,
I received a lot of job offers

237
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,333
to be in movies and plays
and television shows.

238
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,666
But after accomplishing
something like

239
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,041
the legendary great maneuver,

240
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,000
I didn't feel
interested in anything.

241
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,791
And then...

242
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,208
You-You have a visitor.

243
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,166
Thank you for seeing me.

244
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,125
Here's the script.

245
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,625
And if I might ask, when
will your injury be healed?

246
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,333
To recover any range
of motion in my arm

247
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,166
will probably take
about a month.

248
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,166
I would be grateful if you could
find a way to recover faster.

249
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,250
But I guess I'll have to wait.

250
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,833
So why don't we team up?
You won't regret it.

251
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,333
"Salome in Vegas"?

252
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,500
Everything about it was fresh.

253
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,833
Yes, there were some people

254
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,666
who murmured that I had
fallen in the world,

255
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,208
because I was
willing to appear in

256
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,000
an off-Broadway show
that wasn't very big.

257
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,250
But things like that
have never bothered me.

258
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,000
And I paid no attention to them.

259
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,500
Because in that show,

260
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:06,541
I had once again found
something that motivated me.

261
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:11,583
And that's when I knew that
this stage would be my new home.

262
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:16,083
And I also knew then that
Cathy would be my new partner.

263
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,916
So you now consider
Cathy to be your partner?

264
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,083
I do.

265
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,458
Layla, I will do my
very best on stage,

266
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,458
to prove to you that I
should also be considered

267
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,875
as your partner.

268
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,000
I have always
dreamed that one day

269
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,666
I would appear
on stage with you.

270
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,875
And what's your
dream after that?

271
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,500
Wha-What?

272
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,416
My dream after that dream?

273
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,750
I'm curious,

274
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,500
because your current dream
will come true tomorrow.

275
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,750
You're right.

276
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,583
I guess I was preoccupied
with beating Sora,

277
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,083
so I never thought about it.

278
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,041
So it's really true then, Layla?

279
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,666
Your current dream is here, huh?

280
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,875
Sora.

281
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,583
That's right.

282
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,000
You haven't touched
my coffee at all.

283
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,458
Disgusting.

284
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,083
And I also knew then that
Cathy would be my new partner.

285
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,166
I'm no longer Layla's partner.

286
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,625
I know that.

287
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,833
Since Layla left Kaleido Stage,

288
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,166
and we started walking
on different paths,

289
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,375
it's natural that
things would change.

290
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,750
I know that.

291
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,958
But still, I never
expected to hear it

292
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,916
said so clearly straight
from Layla's mouth.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,208
I never expected I would
feel so totally alone,

294
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,375
just hearing Layla
utter those words.

295
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,958
When it comes down to it,

296
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,041
I can't stand on my own,
even a little bit.

297
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,541
It's so pathetic!

298
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,791
This isn't good.

299
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,875
I can't perform tomorrow
feeling like this.

300
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,333
I have to pull myself together.

301
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:10,333
Layla's constellation is Leo,
which emits a blinding light.

302
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,125
And hidden in its shadow
is Sora's Sagittarius,

303
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,500
who's lost sight of the target
at which it should be aiming.

304
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,166
I wouldn't worry about anything.

305
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,958
Just perform the role
however you feel like it.

306
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,625
Okay.

307
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,583
Stop looking at me with
those puppy dog eyes.

308
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,958
I want you to get on the
stage with enough spirit

309
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,958
to steal the part
of Salome from me.

310
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,000
Salome, please
come dance for me!

311
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,708
I don't want to dance right now.

312
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,500
Herron, I think my heart
might be the only thing in

313
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:02,333
the whole country that doesn't
do exactly as you please.

314
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,958
Salome.

315
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,916
Johann, your skin is so white
it's like new-fallen snow,

316
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,916
and your lips are so soft...

317
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,083
Salome, don't ever
touch me again!

318
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,916
Johann!

319
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,750
Johann...

320
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,541
I love you.

321
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,541
I want you to get on the
stage with enough spirit

322
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,208
to steal the part
of Salome from me.

323
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,500
Stand-by.

324
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,833
Herron, I will
dance for you now.

325
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,208
But in return, I want
you to grant my wish!

326
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,375
Now, the match begins.

327
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,875
Steal the audience's eyes.

328
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,958
Intimidate me!

329
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,333
In order to meet
Layla's expectations...

330
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,666
I'll have to give a performance
that's even better than Layla's.

331
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,541
Layla!

332
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,083
I want to be acknowledged.

333
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,833
I won't lose to May.

334
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,625
I won't lose to Sora.

335
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,041
I will win no matter what!

336
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,041
I'll make sure I win!

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,333
This is great!

338
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,000
But...

339
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,666
I just cannot beat Layla.

340
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,833
Ask me for anything your
heart desires, Salome.

341
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:11,125
There is but only one
thing I want, Herron.

342
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,500
So, this is what you want, huh?

343
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,250
I do.

344
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,125
Layla shines so supremely
up there on that stage.

345
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,916
But no matter what I do, I can't
catch up with her at all.

346
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,458
We couldn't even match the
performance that Layla gave.

347
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,833
Mmm.

348
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,666
Thank you for coming this week.

349
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,291
Thanks to you, the show
was a great success.

350
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,458
Was it really?

351
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,291
Really. Because of you,

352
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,708
Cathy finally understands
what I'm talking about

353
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,958
when I say there's not
enough fire on the stage.

354
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,541
You mean...that's the reason
you invited me here?

355
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,791
Yes, I thought you
could help me show Cathy

356
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:13,125
what a fiery stage was like,
but you've changed, Sora.

357
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,541
When I was still
performing at Kaleido Stage,

358
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,083
I was always fearful
that you would

359
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,583
come up from behind
and surpass me.

360
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,750
But this time around,

361
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
I didn't feel any
kind of competitive edge

362
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,416
from you out there at all.

363
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,875
When times get rough,

364
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,541
you're the only person
who can save yourself.

365
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,125
What you're aiming for in life,
what you're hoping to grasp...

366
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,500
The only one who knows is you.

367
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:40,875
The answer to all of these
are to be found inside of you.

368
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,083
I will find my current dream
on this stage in New York.

369
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,541
Of course, I still have my
dream for Kaleido Stage,

370
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,750
and it's very important to me.

371
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,666
I'm putting all my
faith in you, Sora,

372
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,500
because I know you have what it
takes to be a true Kaleido Star.

373
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,416
Layla!

374
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,416
Go after your dream,
and don't let yourself get lost.

375
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,916
If you do that,

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,708
the road to becoming a Kaleido
Star will appear for you.

377
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,125
Going after my dream...

378
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,750
That's right, just
keep going, Sora.

379
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,083
I will.

380
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,416
Say hello to everyone
at Kaleido Stage for me.

381
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,625
--Yes.
--Yes! Don't worry.

382
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,875
I'll take care of it for you!

383
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,375
Fool!

384
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,000
I can still see you.

385
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:33,083
I admit I didn't understand
your relationship with Layla,

386
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,916
but don't get the wrong idea.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,458
We're still competitors.

388
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,916
Yeah, I understand.

389
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,375
Still, I wonder what
I wanna do now.

390
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,166
The answer is inside me.

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,750
I don't want my dad
looking sad like that.

392
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,125
And so, we decided to do
a kids show at Kaleido Stage.

393
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,125
Wow, Marion is really
good at the trampoline!

394
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,833
I'm not doing the trampoline!

395
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,708
Are you gonna bury your dream
with your mother's memories?

396
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,250
I wanna bring back
a smile to Marion's face.

397
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,833
I want to! I want to! I want to!

398
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,666
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"Marion's Amazing Debut."

399
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,708
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
