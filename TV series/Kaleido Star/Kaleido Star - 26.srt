1
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,041
It is now time to watch Kaleido
Star, so keep your room bright,

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,958
sit far enough away from
the TV, and wait for

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,791
the hour of your fate.

4
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,208
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,458
As the Fool said,
'The time is now.'

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,958
Finally, Layla and I
are going to attempt

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,750
the Legendary Great Maneuver!

8
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,416
It's been a really rough road,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
and I've thought
about quitting a lot.

10
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,583
But this show is going to make
all my hard work worthwhile.

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,458
The next tears I cry will be
tears of joy! Tears of joy!

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,958
Why fear it when
it won't happen?

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,791
We'll perform the
maneuver perfectly.

14
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,833
The time is now.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,916
You both were
chosen by the stage,

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,875
and you have persevered
through many hardships.

17
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,083
You have finally earned
the right to learn about

18
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,583
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

19
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,666
You must only attempt
this maneuver if you have

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,250
unshakable confidence. Now
I will tell you all I know.

21
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,500
'An Amazing Comeback.'

22
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,458
What's going on?

23
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:02,000
The spirit of the stage must
be here. Instructing them.

24
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,333
Huh?

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,916
I think you're right.
Anyone wishing to attempt

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,833
the Legendary Great Maneuver
must have great confidence.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,791
Once they tell the spirit
they have no fear of failure,

28
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,291
no fear of death, he
begins to instruct them.

29
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,291
Oh. But what would happen
if they said they were

30
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,625
afraid of dying?

31
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,458
Then the spirit of the
stage would've disappeared

32
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,541
and we'd have been
forced to cancel.

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,500
Unless they decided
to perform anyway...

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,833
So that's the
Legendary Great Maneuver?

35
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,875
Amazing.

36
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,666
It's even better
than I imagined.

37
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,833
I think the best thing would be
for you to rest your shoulder

38
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,375
and for me to rehearse more.

39
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,708
That way, both of us
will be ready for tomorrow!

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,791
That sounds perfect. Mia?

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,375
Yes?

42
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,791
I'd like to talk to you about
the set we'll be on tomorrow.

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
Could you pass my suggestions
along to the director?

44
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:51,708
Sure.

45
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
Everything is in motion.

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,416
Your wait is almost over:
tomorrow Sora Naegino

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,083
and Layla Hamilton will attempt
the Legendary Great Maneuver!

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,083
Good! Keep that height
and rhythm, people!

49
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,791
And after that, Layla
says they'll need to switch

50
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,583
to the trampoline.

51
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,833
All of you will wait at
this gate until it's time

52
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,041
for your entrance.

53
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,250
Hey, Anna!

54
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,916
Hey! You guys all came!

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,333
Of course we did.

56
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,708
There's no way we were
gonna just sit at home.

57
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,541
So what's the deal with this
Legendary Great Maneuver, huh?

58
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,958
I don't know.

59
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,333
I've just rebuilt what
Arlon had me build years ago.

60
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,166
One, two, jump!

61
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah!

62
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,750
Higher, folks you've really
got to get up there!

63
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,000
Yay, that was incredible!

64
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,750
Hi, Marion, Jonathan!

65
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,958
Come see!
Everybody has come back!

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,083
What?

67
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,500
Everyone from
Freedom Rights is here.

68
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,916
Even the people who quit
Kaleido Stage came back

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,541
just to see this, Sora!

70
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,750
Really?

71
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,791
Kaleido Stage is just
the way it used to be!

72
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,458
We did it!

73
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,416
I haven't seen you in a while.

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
The last time was at that
festival in Vancouver. Right?

75
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,916
That's right.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,958
I'm going to Asia
on business tomorrow

77
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,500
so I don't have much time here.

78
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,250
Why don't you just
tell me what you want.

79
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,708
You need to see
Layla's show tomorrow.

80
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,291
It's extremely important.

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,750
I figured you'd say
something like that.

82
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,250
You see, I've already
heard Kaleido Stage

83
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,958
is going up for sale.

84
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,125
Well, you couldn't be more
wrong if you think I'm the man

85
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,583
who'll help you keep it

86
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,250
I got out of that venture
and I've never been happier.

87
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,291
You and I are two of a kind,
do you know that?

88
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,125
Isn't it funny? I tried to
create the Kaleido Stage

89
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,083
I thought my Father
would've wanted.

90
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,500
But it turns out, all the things
I thought were important weren't

91
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,416
his priorities at all.

92
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,791
I wasn't trying to understand.
Just like you don't ever try

93
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,625
to understand how
your daughter feels.

94
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,333
I don't try to
understand? Ridiculous.

95
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:10,583
I'm a fool. I've been fixating
on a wrong that never existed.

96
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,333
And now I know that my
Father would've hated

97
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,833
what I've been doing.

98
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,625
And you're a fool for making
your daughter choose between

99
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,791
her love for you and her
love for Kaleido Stage.

100
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,333
Make no mistake, she can
live without your help.

101
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,958
She can do more than
that she can fly.

102
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,666
Honestly, I've never seen anyone
who was as good as Layla.

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,208
But it doesn't matter
what I think of her,

104
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,458
because the only one
she wants to please is you.

105
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,625
But you're too busy with
your money to notice that.

106
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,375
You've been blind, Hamilton.

107
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,250
Did you at least enjoy
what I did out there?

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,000
So tomorrow I'm
reserving you a seat.

109
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,333
Hi, Mom. It's me.

110
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,583
That's right, the show's
going to be tomorrow night.

111
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:57,208
I'm really sorry about
the short notice on this...

112
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, really? How's Yume? Ohhh.
No, don't worry about that.

113
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,041
I've already
reserved your seats.

114
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,791
So, how's the pain
in your shoulder?

115
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:16,541
Better. I should be able to
perform tomorrow after all.

116
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,583
It's funny...

117
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,541
I'm usually really nervous
before opening a new production.

118
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,541
But I haven't felt
this calm in years.

119
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't wait to step
on that stage tomorrow.

120
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,541
As your doctor, I want
to remind you again that

121
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,916
performing with that shoulder
is a terrible idea.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,041
But I know you're going
to do it anyway so I promise

123
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,291
I'll do everything
I can to get you through

124
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,166
that show tomorrow night.

125
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,625
Yeah that's great. Thanks Kate.

126
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,125
Sora, are you in here?

127
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,208
No way! She can do all
that with just one arm?!

128
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,291
Hey, Rosetta!

129
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,500
Oh wow. This is gonna be great!

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,625
Sora.

131
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,625
We're all ready
for the show, too.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,375
Layla...

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,791
And then after they finish
with that routine, the rest of

134
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,750
the cast is going to
clear off of the stage.

135
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,458
Then it's time for you to do the
maneuver. This'll be your set.

136
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,833
Now I know how you must've felt
when my father went on stage

137
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,625
for the last time.

138
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,541
The performers chosen by
the spirit have to attempt

139
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,250
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

140
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,041
Nothing can keep them from it.

141
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,625
No.

142
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,125
I wanted to make Kaleido Stage
a place where no performer

143
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,666
was injured or
killed ever again.

144
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
I never meant
to destroy this place.

145
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,666
You haven't lost
Kaleido Stage yet.

146
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,250
Things could still
look up for you.

147
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,791
You've actually done
a pretty good job.

148
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,000
You know, before your father
died I considered making him

149
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,583
our business manager.

150
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,916
Really? I guess he probably
would've had the sense

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,333
to let you keep Kaleido Stage.

152
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:43,416
No one can nurture talent like
you. Sora's a testament to that.

153
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
I can't take credit for her.

154
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,458
She dashed into this
thing all by herself.

155
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,208
So. Tomorrow's the day...

156
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,333
Yep. This time tomorrow
night we'll be on stage.

157
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,541
The Legendary Great Maneuver...

158
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,916
We're gonna show
that audience something

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,041
they've never seen before.

160
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,958
Now, the swing is longer than
the one we used in practice,

161
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,375
so make sure to
watch your timing.

162
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,541
Right.

163
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,458
You and I are gonna
go out on that stage

164
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,291
and do the
impossible this evening.

165
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:23,500
Yes. But, Layla do you mind
if I ask you something?

166
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,833
Go ahead.

167
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,583
What would you have done
if the Fool had decided we

168
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,166
weren't ready to learn about
the maneuver yesterday.

169
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,000
If he hadn't thought
we were qualified?

170
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,208
I never doubted that
he would tell us.

171
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,083
What? You mean never,
not even once?

172
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,583
No. Honestly, it never
crossed my mind that

173
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,416
he wouldn't find us qualified.

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,958
But that's usually how
I feel when I decide

175
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,333
I'm going to do something.
What about you?

176
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,125
What, me? Well, I guess
I felt the same as you did.

177
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,791
It it sounds like they're
both laughing. Hey, Sora?

178
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,916
Yes?

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,583
You have some visitors.

180
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
I'll be right there.

181
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,958
Hello, Sora.

182
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,833
You made it! I'm so glad!

183
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,500
Yume... Have you
been a good girl?

184
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,833
Thank you for inviting us. 

185
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,041
No, I'm the one who
should be thanking you guys

186
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,916
for coming all this way.

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,458
We're just so glad that you
asked us to be here for you.

188
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,458
Just a few months ago you never
would have asked, because you

189
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,250
thought traveling would be too
much trouble for us, remember?

190
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,791
Yeah. I guess you're right.

191
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,166
You wanted to fly in and
out of Cape Mary on the day

192
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,791
of your audition
to save us a hotel bill.

193
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,375
I'd forgotten about that.
I was so worried about her.

194
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,041
Yeah. It wasn't
the greatest idea...

195
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,000
Sora, you seem to be
in good spirits today.

196
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,333
Yes, I think you
seem very confident.

197
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,041
I am. That's why I wanted the
both of you to be here so badly.

198
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,208
Oh, and you too, Yume.

199
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,291
We're not your only
family who'll be here.

200
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,208
After all,
you have four parents.

201
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,791
And every one of us
will be cheering you on.

202
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,750
You're extremely pushy,
you know that?

203
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,708
Say what you want about me,
but please keep an open mind.

204
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,000
Just watch the show
tonight and tell me if you

205
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,041
still wanna sell Kaleido Stage.

206
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,000
Look, kid, it's already sold.

207
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
Mr. Kenneth?

208
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,000
Then maybe I should consider
buying it back again.

209
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,625
By yourself? That's ridiculous.
You'd take a bath on it.

210
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,791
A bit of advice: people who
don't take chances won't reap

211
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,458
the greatest rewards
of this life, chump.

212
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,125
Just keep it nice
and still, Sora.

213
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,291
Right. 

214
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,041
Once we do the
Legendary Great Maneuver,

215
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,583
I think the audiences will
start coming back here.

216
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,583
I think so too.

217
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,791
And when they come back

218
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,416
we'll have to have a new
production for them.

219
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,541
Something both kids
and adults can enjoy,

220
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,375
just like the old days.

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,916
Oh, how is everybody?
Good, I hope.

222
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They're all fine.

223
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,708
That's what I like to hear.

224
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,500
The final card is The Fool,

225
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,875
foretelling almost
unlimited possibilities.

226
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,875
The door to great things will
only be opened for those

227
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,333
foolish enough not to be afraid.

228
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,291
It doesn't look like
they're wearing lifelines.

229
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,166
That means that if they drop...

230
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,000
That would be awful.

231
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,166
This performance with Layla

232
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,958
is gonna be the best
Kaleido Stage ever.

233
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,250
Sora...

234
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,708
I don't know.
This is making me nervous...

235
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,333
They're really high up there,
but it still feels like I could

236
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,958
touch them. It feels
just like magic.

237
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,125
Are you ready, Sora?

238
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,291
Yes.

239
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,625
Just focus on
what Layla's doing.

240
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,666
Let's do this Sora.

241
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,666
Jump towards Layla. Now!

242
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,916
Amazing.

243
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,833
They did it!

244
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,791
They're flying!
They really are!

245
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,625
It's like they both grew
wings. It's incredible!

246
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,375
H-How is something
like that possible?!

247
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,458
I always knew those girls
would pull this off.

248
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,250
As long as I can
stay up here with Layla

249
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,458
I won't ever be afraid.

250
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm so happy I feel like crying.

251
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,250
I don't ever want
this moment to end.

252
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,791
I want to keep performing
like this forever!

253
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,458
An absolute faith in life,

254
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,416
one so complete
that it knows no fear.

255
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,166
That is the
Legendary Great Maneuver.

256
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,500
I see now. The
Legendary Great Maneuver

257
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,375
displays such faith in life,
it keeps death at bay.

258
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,666
That's why we thought
it was impossible.

259
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,416
But to find faith
as great as theirs...

260
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,291
Arlon I think you must
have glimpsed it:

261
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,291
an act so powerful it gives
all who see it new strength...

262
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,208
Amazing. And I thought
I had the power to stand

263
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,791
in the way of this...

264
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,833
Sora, it's time to go back.

265
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,333
Right.

266
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,208
It looks like the wind is
pushing the swings further out.

267
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,666
We'll have to push harder.

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,166
I'm ready.

269
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,583
One. Two. Three!

270
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,250
It it's over now.

271
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,083
Quick, dim the lights on Layla.

272
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,291
Now? But I--

273
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,750
Do it. Right now.

274
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,916
Sure.

275
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,125
Layla's hurt.

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,541
That was great!
Sora, you're my hero!

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,416
Perfect! I've never
seen anything like it!

278
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,291
Sora, you did it.

279
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,125
How strange, it still
feels like I'm flying.

280
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,791
Layla.

281
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,208
Father?

282
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,125
That was a wonderful show.

283
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
You were watching?

284
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:26,833
Yes. And now I understand
what Yuri meant.

285
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,416
Yuri?

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,416
You really can fly and you
don't need my help to do it.

287
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
You've become a remarkably
strong young woman, Layla.

288
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,458
Father, thank you.

289
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,541
Did you hurt your
shoulder up there?

290
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,666
Yes.

291
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,208
Is it bad?

292
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,916
I think it is. There's no way
I'll ever be able to perform

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,750
at Kaleido Stage again.

294
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,833
What?

295
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,000
Do you really mean that?

296
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,791
Yes, I do.

297
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,250
It can't it can't be...

298
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:05,041
Kate told me this would probably
happen. But I had to do this.

299
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,750
We achieved the impossible
and got the best applause.

300
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,500
But if this has to be my last
show ever, I couldn't have

301
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:17,875
wished for a better performance
or a better partner.

302
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:22,791
But you...
it can't... it can't be

303
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,541
Sora!

304
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,250
Sora.

305
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,916
Sora, you have to be strong.

306
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,083
But I can't I can't!

307
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,333
When I decided to attempt
the Legendary Great Maneuver

308
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,333
with you, I knew
there would be a price.

309
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,041
But I was willing
to try this with you,

310
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,750
no matter what
the risks might be.

311
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,166
Sora. Today before the show
you told me you never doubted

312
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,583
you'd be able
to do the maneuver.

313
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,458
I need you to have
that kind of faith now.

314
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,458
You need to stand up, Sora.

315
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:50,583
Sora from now on
I want you to be my dream.

316
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,458
I'm putting all
my faith in you, Sora.

317
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,000
You want me to be
your dream, Layla?

318
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,750
I do. Because I know you
have what it takes to be

319
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,250
a true Kaleido Star.

320
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,875
A true Kaleido Star...

321
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,708
Sora!

322
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,958
Sora? Come on, hurry!

323
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,500
Hey, Sora!

324
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,708
Coming!

325
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,583
For Layla, I'm going to
become a true Kaleido Star,

326
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,708
no matter what it takes.
I will! I will!

327
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,875
Looks like I've got
a long way to go...

328
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,041
Hi, everybody! I bet you all
want to know what it was like

329
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,000
to do the Legendary
Great Maneuver.

330
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,666
Well, it was really hard.

331
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,041
I cried a lot and we
trained all the time.

332
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,500
But it was a great feeling
when we finally did it.

333
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,333
And now that Layla
can't perform anymore,

334
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,791
I'm gonna work hard to
make her dream come true.

335
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,833
I'm going to become a Kaleido
Star for her, no matter what.

336
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,541
I'll do it! I'll do it!

337
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,666
Don't miss the next
episode of Kaleido Star,

338
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,791
'The Amazing Prologue
to Stardom (Part 1)'

339
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,166
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
