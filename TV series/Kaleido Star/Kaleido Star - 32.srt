1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,375
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,833
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,250
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,458
Well, well, well, have you
ever wanted to go ice skating?

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,416
To feel yourself
gliding gracefully

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,125
across the ice in a turn?

7
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,666
It's so cool!

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,000
This is my first time on the
ice, and it's super difficult.

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,208
I thought this would be a cinch,

10
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,166
'cause I'm really good
at inline skating,

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,875
but I just keep falling down
and slamming into walls.

12
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,166
Ouch!

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,375
Unless I'm able to do this,

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,541
I'm gonna get
beaten by May again.

15
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,166
I can't back down now!

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,583
I can't! I can't!

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,125
Everyone wants to reach the top,

18
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,833
but no one has ever
managed to get there.

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:40,041
Sora, to be on top, you must
first aim to be a real star.

20
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,875
A real star?

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,625
Yes. Become a real star,

22
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,375
one whose performance
will unite the hearts

23
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,250
of an entire audience.

24
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,166
Of course, you will have to give

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,958
the greatest performance
ever seen on stage.

26
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,458
Sora, surpass me.

27
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,041
Oh no! I can't! Not me.

28
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh yes you can.

29
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,708
I want you to become a star.

30
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,041
A real Kaleido Star.

31
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,666
Let me see you shine.

32
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,208
When you do,

33
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,291
I'm sure that Kaleido Stage will
spread its wings once again.

34
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,083
Layla entrusted me
with the job of

35
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,083
making Kaleido Stage
a great place again,

36
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
but I think everything
I've done so far

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,625
would only be a big
disappointment to her.

38
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,916
What's worse, I've hurt
Layla's reputation.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,416
Layla Hamilton was probably

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,916
every bit as soft
as you people are.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,208
I can't stand to hear him
talk about Layla like that.

42
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
But the only thing
I can do right now

43
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,375
is to work as hard as I can
to get acknowledged by Leon,

44
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,583
and to be chosen as his partner.

45
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,041
Then one day, I will
make him take back

46
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,708
all the horrible things
he said about Layla.

47
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,791
He will take it back.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,041
"Amazing Match on Ice."

49
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,000
These are the things
you need to change,

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,833
based on what I've seen.

51
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,416
It may be depressing hearing
this first thing in the morning,

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,708
but I say it to help you out.

53
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,458
--Sora!
--Yes?

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,750
Oh, good morning, Ken!

55
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:17,375
Sora, were you listening
to what I was saying?

56
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,666
What you were saying?

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,375
Oh, well, it wasn't
anything important at all.

58
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,833
Just small talk.

59
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,583
Okay, bye.

60
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,500
You're a real non-entity.

61
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,541
But you could also be
a great gag character!

62
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,708
Hey, Ken?

63
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,250
Yeah.

64
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,958
Do you wanna be my partner?

65
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:38,875
No.

66
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,291
Have you seen May?

67
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,458
There's a cast meeting for
those playing town girls,

68
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,041
and she hasn't shown up for it.

69
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,083
No, I haven't seen her.

70
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,208
I know it's only a minor part,

71
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,625
but I thought she
would be all excited

72
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,416
about finally getting
a nod to perform on stage.

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,416
Well, I don't think that's the
kind of role May wants to play.

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,541
Then she's getting
special training

75
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,291
from a mysterious master?

76
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,250
I doubt that.

77
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,166
Then she's with a
handsome stranger?

78
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,625
No, I don't see her
doing that either.

79
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,541
And I have no idea what
you're talking about.

80
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,416
Then I wonder what
happened to her.

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,583
Hmm.

82
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,750
Leon!

83
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,666
--Wait a minute.
--Who is that?

84
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,166
Who's that?

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,916
--I've never seen her before.
--She has a lot of nerve.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,291
May!

87
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,125
May, all cast members
assigned to play town girls

88
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,458
should be in the
meeting room right now.

89
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,208
I am not interested in
going to that meeting.

90
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,916
Oh man, here we go again.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,625
Leon, please come
with me right now!

92
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,791
Huh? You mean right now?

93
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,416
I'll show you just how good
I can be when I really shine.

94
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,083
Do you know what she's
trying to do this time?

95
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,666
No.

96
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,125
She wanted to show him how she
looks when she really shines.

97
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,125
But why ice skating?

98
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,250
Isn't that May?

99
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,291
Yeah, you're right.

100
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,583
Hey, May. It's been a while.

101
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,666
I had no idea May was
so good at skating.

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,208
I know, and she's way
better than just good.

103
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,625
Now ya know why we call
her the ice fairy.

104
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,541
Mina Murray.

105
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,958
Huh?

106
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,041
May is performing the role
of Dracula's leading lady,

107
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,625
Mina Murray.

108
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,708
But if I remember right,
isn't Mina Murray

109
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,166
supposed to do a
Screw Spin on the trapeze?

110
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,958
Um, yeah.

111
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,958
So, being good at skating
can't possibly get her the role.

112
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,041
True.

113
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,875
But she's really shining
out there on the ice.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,250
Look at that!

115
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,500
Yeah!

116
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,583
Wow, May really
knows how to skate.

117
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,541
Mia, change the script.

118
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,916
What? Change it?

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,416
Dracula will be an
ice skating show.

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Huh?

121
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,833
Skating?

122
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,166
Then, does this mean you've
chosen me as your partner?

123
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,291
Mademoiselle, do you think I was
impressed by your performance?

124
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,291
How can you say that?

125
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,125
My performance was
technically flawless.

126
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,958
You may have been satisfied,

127
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,250
but I was not
impressed in the least.

128
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,833
In fact, I was bored.

129
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,625
I just like the idea of
doing the show on ice skates.

130
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,375
First he wants it
without Mina Murray,

131
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,166
and then he wants it on skates?

132
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,375
This is nothing like
my original concept!

133
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,583
It's okay.

134
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,333
Skating. Oh, well.

135
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,750
All right! I'm gonna
challenge you at skating.

136
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,791
--Huh?
--What?

137
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,208
If I have to master skating

138
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,291
in order to play the
role of Mina Murray,

139
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,500
then that's what I'm gonna do!

140
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,791
Are you kidding?

141
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,625
Do you seriously think
you stand a chance

142
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,083
at beating me at skating?

143
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,791
Well... Well, I won't
know until I try it.

144
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,458
So let's begin.

145
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,000
She isn't too bad.

146
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,833
Well, she is good
at inline skating.

147
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,458
Huh, what's going on?
Why am I not turning?

148
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,833
Oh goodness!

149
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,708
This could be pretty difficult.

150
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,208
Oh yeah.

151
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,500
Now she's worse than a beginner.

152
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,000
More than worse.

153
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,375
But I have to get used
to keeping my balance.

154
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,458
Straighten your back.

155
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,166
Yes!

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,500
Put your feet sideways.

157
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,250
Huh?

158
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,208
Keep your legs apart.

159
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,375
I-I...

160
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,916
Keep your back straight!

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,166
Wait, I didn't fall down.

162
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,375
Unlike inline skates,
the way you avoid slipping

163
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,541
on ice skates is to keep
them at an angle to the ice.

164
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,791
Oh.

165
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,875
Now hold that pose.

166
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,125
Whoa!

167
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,583
Huh? I'm skating!

168
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,375
Well now, you must
have real talent

169
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,875
to pick things up so quickly.

170
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,416
You think so?

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,416
Who's that?

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,583
Beats me.

173
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,833
Oh, I forgot to
introduce myself.

174
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,041
My name is Meryl.

175
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,708
I work here at the ice rink.

176
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,375
I'm Sora Naegino.
I work at Kaleido Stage.

177
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,083
Are you competing for a role
with May or something?

178
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,291
You know about May?

179
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,500
I do.

180
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,250
I haven't seen her
in some time now,

181
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,583
but her skating hasn't
lost any of its edge.

182
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,125
It's such a waste,

183
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,375
because she could really shine
on the international stage.

184
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
She's really that good?

185
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,708
Yes.

186
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,333
When May first came
to the skating rink,

187
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,291
she was just a little girl,
maybe three or four years old.

188
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,250
When I saw her,

189
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,083
I knew instantly
May had the talent

190
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,208
to compete at the world level.

191
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
If she kept on practicing,

192
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,958
I thought there
was a good chance

193
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,791
she might even go on
to win a gold medal.

194
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,708
But May had already gone and
found herself another dream.

195
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,333
A great big dream.

196
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,583
Amazing. Layla is so amazing.

197
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,541
One day, when I grow up,

198
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:17,708
I will join Kaleido Stage
and perform with Layla.

199
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,375
One day.

200
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,458
It was her strongest desire.

201
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,666
No matter how hard
I tried to persuade her,

202
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,458
she wouldn't change her mind.

203
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,208
Layla... Is the one
who inspired May?

204
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,625
Where did I go wrong?

205
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,500
Where could I have messed up?

206
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,083
I've tried and Leon
still doesn't like me.

207
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,416
May was very clear
about her desire.

208
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,333
She might have liked skating,

209
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,500
but she was in love
with Kaleido Stage.

210
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,583
I-I want to become
a Kaleido Star,

211
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,500
a real Kaleido Star who
shines on stage like Layla.

212
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,458
Meryl, I'm very sorry.

213
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,666
I know you wanted me
to keep on skating...

214
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,833
but I won't.

215
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,125
I'm going to give
up these skates.

216
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,041
In three years, after
I'm finished with school,

217
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,916
I'll audition.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,416
And after I get in,
I know I will

219
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,916
stand on the same
stage with Layla.

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,291
Please be sure
to come to see me.

221
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,875
May is just like me.

222
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,541
She was inspired by Layla

223
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,708
and wanted to perform
with her on Kaleido Stage.

224
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,375
But then Layla got injured

225
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,208
and had to retire
from her stage career.

226
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,458
I guess May hates me

227
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,041
because I had the chance
to perform with Layla.

228
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,333
What do you think, Fool?

229
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,291
If you want to become
her friend now,

230
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,000
there's only one
thing you can do.

231
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,208
Tell me please.

232
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,583
Invite her...
to sleepover with-

233
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,166
Cracking jokes like that

234
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,750
when I'm seriously worried about
something is not a good idea!

235
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,875
Are you kidding?
I was being serious.

236
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,500
A slumber party's a great
way to make friends-

237
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,000
Sora, Sora let me out of here!

238
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,125
I won't let you down
this time, Layla.

239
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,333
I'm gonna work
hard and beat May,

240
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,833
so that she feels
she has the chance

241
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,583
to compete against
a real Kaleido Star.

242
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,791
I heard my dad
saying the new stage

243
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,333
will be ready for
skating in three days.

244
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,083
That's when Leon plans
to take a test run on it.

245
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,416
After that, he'll make his final
decisions on script and cast.

246
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,625
So their final chance in front
of Leon will be in three days.

247
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,875
Mm-hmm.

248
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,125
That's not enough time
to learn how to skate.

249
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,041
Please Meryl! I only have
three days to learn this act.

250
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,291
Come on!

251
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,625
I just have to beat May
at skating. I have to.

252
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,666
You sound quite determined.

253
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,208
Okay then, I'll teach you.

254
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,291
I guess I have no choice

255
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,791
but to go back to Meryl
and ask for help.

256
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,250
Meryl!

257
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,958
Ah, it's you, May.

258
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,666
If you're lookin' for Meryl,
she's out on the rink.

259
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,666
Try it again but
with more effort.

260
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,375
Okay.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,916
Meryl!

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,208
What is this?

263
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,291
Why are you teaching Sora?

264
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,000
Who I teach is my business.

265
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,583
I asked for her help,

266
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,833
because I wanted to be able to
compete with you as an equal.

267
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:56,250
Watch out, if you let down your
guard, Sora will surpass you.

268
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,791
Do you think that I'm going
to be surpassed by Sora?

269
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you?

270
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,416
Yeah, I do.

271
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,541
Sora is talented.

272
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,958
She might even turn out to
be a better skater than you.

273
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,458
Oh yes. I am the one
teaching her, you know.

274
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:17,250
This is nonsense. There's
no way I can lose at skating.

275
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,166
And I'm definitely not going
to lose to someone like Sora.

276
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,958
I will not lose to her!
Not now, not ever!

277
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,208
Sora! Give it more confidence!

278
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,708
Yes!

279
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,416
They're both amazing!

280
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,000
May is impressive,
but I'm improving quickly.

281
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,083
I'll give her a real
challenge and make Layla proud.

282
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,125
Huh?

283
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,291
Sora, you have a big weakness,

284
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,375
and fortunately you're
probably not even aware of it.

285
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,666
Sora's amazing.
Look how fast she's improved.

286
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,958
She could turn
around and win this.

287
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,750
How are you feeling?

288
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,458
I think I'm just about in
peak condition right now.

289
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,791
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

290
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,458
Sora's physical strength
is her big weakness.

291
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,000
But she doesn't have time
to overcome it in two days.

292
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,375
I guess there's no point
in bringing it up now.

293
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,375
Tomorrow is the big day.

294
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,041
I'm sure Sora will be
able to pull it off.

295
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,833
Oh please, please let Leon
choose Sora to play Mina Murray.

296
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,041
She became this
good in three days?

297
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,958
So, she does have talent.

298
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,125
Technique by itself
will not be enough

299
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,875
to convince Leon to
choose me as his partner.

300
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,291
While Sora may not be
technically perfect,

301
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,958
she does have a way of
connecting with the audience,

302
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,291
and that just might be
enough for her to win.

303
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,625
I will not... I will not...
I will not let that happen!

304
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,791
I will not let you beat me!

305
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,916
It's been a long
time since I've seen

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,708
such desperation on May's face.

307
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,083
Wow, Sora's pretty good.

308
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,708
Yeah, she's awesome.

309
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,666
Sora, you can do it!

310
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,291
In three days, what
could have changed?

311
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,708
Hmm.

312
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,458
The composure she had
is now completely gone.

313
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,791
Could this be because of Sora?

314
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,166
She is quite
interesting, this one.

315
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,791
If you want to be my partner,
then come up here.

316
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,958
I can't believe he
actually jumped up there.

317
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,666
It's superhuman.

318
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,916
Be safe, Sora.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,416
Does he really think
they can make this jump?

320
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,750
When it comes to technical
perfection, there is no contest.

321
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,666
May is clearly the superior.

322
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,125
In fact, Sora looks like she
just learned how to skate.

323
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,833
Still, she possesses
something...

324
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:20,166
I cannot put my
finger on what it is.

325
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,708
But I've definitely
felt it before...

326
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,541
when she was performing.

327
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:28,458
It is something strange,
something powerful.

328
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,125
But what is it?

329
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,791
I will not be beaten!

330
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,708
I will not lose to her!

331
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:48,750
Oh no!

332
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,000
Sora!

333
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,041
Hmm.

334
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,333
They can't reach.

335
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,958
I lost.

336
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,000
I wasn't good enough to
be acknowledged by Leon.

337
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:51,083
I'm sorry, Layla. Sorry, Mia.

338
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,500
She lost the race.

339
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,208
Why did he pick May?

340
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,666
Sora.

341
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,375
Do you guys think this means
May has won Leon's heart?

342
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,416
You will play Mina Murray.

343
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,708
Oh yes!

344
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,500
Thank you.

345
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,500
I lost, but it won't do me any
good to keep moping about it.

346
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,500
What I have to do now,
is to focus on making Dracula

347
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,958
the best show Kaleido
Stage has ever done.

348
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,208
Niagara Diving!

349
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,125
I can hear it.
I can hear the applause.

350
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,416
They're applauding for me.

351
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,416
May, you have
found a good rival.

352
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,250
Grand Screw Jump!

353
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,583
Sora, you have a
mysterious power.

354
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,458
Somehow you can bring
out the very best

355
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:31,208
in the people around you
and make them shine on stage.

356
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,500
But if you are ever
to shine yourself,

357
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,458
you must first
overcome your weakness.

358
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,750
The fight between the two
of you is just beginning.

359
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,375
But I'm looking
forward to finding out

360
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,458
which one of you will
become a real star.

361
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,875
Sora, my teacher,
please train me!

362
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,291
I can't believe it!

363
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,458
Rosetta told Kalos that
unless she can master

364
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,666
the swing in three days,
she would quit.

365
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,041
It'll be a crash course.

366
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:15,041
Uh-oh, I think Rosetta
has caught Sora's disease.

367
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,791
But she's calling
me her teacher now,

368
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,750
so I have no choice
but to do it.

369
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,583
I have to! I have to!

370
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,000
Next time on Kaleido Star:

371
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,583
"Amazing Rosetta of
Sweat and Tears."

372
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,666
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
