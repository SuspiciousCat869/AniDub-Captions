1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,625
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,750
so make sure that your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,000
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,541
Well, well, well, isn't it
so exciting doing something

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,208
for the first time?

6
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,208
My heart starts racing
just thinking about it!

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,791
This is my first leading role
ever and I'm trying my best,

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,333
but somehow I still end up
getting in trouble.

9
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,500
I just don't know what I'm
doing wrong! I don't, I don't!

10
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,583
Sora Naegino here
will be the Mermaid.

11
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,791
Anna Heart will play the Prince.

12
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,208
'The Little Mermaid' will
be presented by Kenneth in

13
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,416
a special two-week limited
engagement. We hope you enjoy

14
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,250
seeing these up-and-comers
prove themselves.

15
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,416
What's it like to have
your first leading part?

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,375
What do you think about Layla's
move to the silver screen?

17
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,416
Let's see, tomorrow you've got
a photo shoot for the posters

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
and then you've got
a newspaper interview.

19
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,166
Next day you've got another
photo shoot, then you're on TV.

20
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,750
What's wrong?

21
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,458
Oh, nothing. It's just, I still
can't believe this is happening.

22
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,375
Snap out of it. You've got a lot
of work to do, leading lady.

23
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,708
Leading lady...

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,375
'Facing an Amazing Wall.'

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,500
Sora!

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,958
Get your head out of the clouds!

27
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,375
I-- I'm sorry.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,166
We've gotta pose for the
posters. Just follow directions.

29
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,708
Mermaid, I need you to
look a little more lively.

30
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,916
Uh, sure.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,583
Great. And, Prince,
get closer, would you?

32
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,166
Okay, guys, show me the romance.

33
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,875
How about this?

34
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,375
Perfect!

35
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,500
Anna looked so handsome as the
prince. I was so embarrassed...

36
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,625
You both look great!

37
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,333
You really think so?

38
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,416
Don't you like it?

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,875
I was kinda hoping I'd look

40
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,916
more like a jellyfish...

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
Anyway, you guys
are gonna be great.

42
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,791
You think so?

43
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,166
They'd better hope they're good.

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,458
If I was doing those roles

45
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,250
I wouldn't have to
hope for success.

46
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,750
Don't listen to them!

47
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,041
You and Anna are way more
talented than they'll ever be!

48
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh I've got too much
other stuff to worry about,

49
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,000
like how to play the part
as well as Layla did.

50
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,833
I have to be perfect!

51
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,208
Sora! You have a phone call!

52
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,416
A phone call?

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,875
This is Sora.

54
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:19,208
Oh hi, Mom! Huh? Yes.
Well, we're remounting the show

55
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,875
for two weeks and guess
what? I'm the lead!

56
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,083
I know. I will be.
You shouldn't worry so much.

57
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,750
Love you, too. 

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,125
Thanks, Ken.

59
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll bet your folks
are really proud of you.

60
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,333
Yeah. But they're
so worried about me.

61
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,583
You mean because they
think you'll overdo it

62
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,541
since this is your
first starring role?

63
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,041
What other choice do I have?

64
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,083
I'm playing a part
that Layla made famous.

65
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,791
I've gotta work harder
than I ever have!

66
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,708
Ken, did you bring that for me?

67
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,541
Oh that's right.
I almost forgot.

68
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,458
Excellent! Now I can watch
Layla's Little Mermaid over

69
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,916
and over again.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,541
I'm gonna memorize
this tape! Thank you, Ken!

71
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,291
Happy to help. After all, I
wanna see you do well with --

72
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,375
See you later, bye!

73
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,166
Oh, Layla's even better
in this than I remembered,

74
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,291
so beautiful and graceful...

75
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,083
And the audience is so
moved that they're weeping.

76
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,750
That's the thing about this
production -- it's supposed to

77
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,958
make you feel like crying.

78
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,708
I wish I could perform
just like she does.

79
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,083
What're you doing?!

80
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,458
You seem almost giddy today.
But can you afford to be?

81
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,666
What?

82
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,416
The inverted Magician. This
card means that you will lose

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,541
everything unless you commit
yourself to the task at hand--

84
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
I'm trying to watch this.

85
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,083
You know, it would be nice if
you paid some attention to me

86
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,625
every once in a while.

87
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,666
Go for it Sora!

88
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,833
Can't believe we're opening...

89
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,833
You guys, we're
completely sold out!

90
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,750
Really? Good. I was
afraid no one would come

91
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,916
since Layla's not
in it this time.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,416
Sora! I'm counting on you.

93
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,541
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,833
Wow. She's wonderful.

95
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,125
She's more graceful than
I thought she could be.

96
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,458
No way...

97
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,208
She's just like Layla.

98
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,750
Sora...

99
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,125
Sora, that was beautiful!
Just beautiful!

100
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,625
Cheers!

101
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,750
Didn't she do a fantastic job?

102
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,791
Yeah, Sora should be
really proud of herself.

103
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,458
Where is she, anyway?

104
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,583
Uh still on stage, I guess.

105
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,958
It's too bad she's missing this,
especially since you planned

106
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,125
this great party for her debut.

107
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,000
No big deal. That just
means more food for us!

108
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,791
Miss Sarah, you can eat
more than anyone I know.

109
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,958
I'll give a performance tomorrow
that touches their hearts

110
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,500
just like Layla's did.

111
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,750
Oh no...

112
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,125
I don't get it.

113
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,625
How come the audience
is so much smaller today?

114
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,291
And after we gave such
a perfect show yesterday.

115
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,666
I mean, even our most difficult
routines were totally spot-on.

116
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,583
Hey, have you seen Sora?

117
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,125
It's Sora.

118
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,250
Come in.

119
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,583
Okay, Boss.

120
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Mr. Kenneth?

121
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,791
Let's cut to the chase: her
performance stunk yesterday.

122
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,625
I'd never have replaced Layla if
I'd known she'd be this bad.

123
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,333
I guess it serves me right
for trying something new...

124
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,708
Wait, Mr. Kenneth. I know
my performance isn't as good

125
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,291
as Layla's, no one knows that
better than I do, but I'm still

126
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,416
working and it and I promise
I won't let you down, sir.

127
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, this is useless.

128
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:38,125
You don't even know why I'm
disappointed in you, do you?

129
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,125
Kalos. Get Layla
back here quick.

130
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,875
But she's in the middle
of filming for her movie,

131
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,791
remember, sir?

132
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,916
Then get her back here

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,208
once she's done with
her blasted movie!

134
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,041
Mr. Kenneth please,
I can do this part!

135
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,125
I'm sorry, Sora, but
the producer has spoken.

136
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,291
Sora?

137
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,333
Ken are those the
audience questionnaires?

138
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:03,833
Yeah.

139
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,875
Let me see!

140
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,916
'You had a new mermaid this
time, but she was wonderful

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,666
just like Layla was.'
'The production was nice.

142
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,166
It looks like you've found
the next Layla Hamilton.

143
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,833
Your beautiful new set made
me wish I could see Layla

144
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,875
perform in it.'

145
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,750
They didn't write
anything negative,

146
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
they just wanted Layla back.

147
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,416
Your Little Mermaid's
technically very good, Sora,

148
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,625
but it just doesn't move people.

149
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,583
But why not? I'm doing
everything Layla did.

150
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,625
I-- I've studied her tape
a hundred times and--

151
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,583
Sora you're not Layla.

152
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,583
This card means that you
will lose everything unless

153
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,833
you commit yourself
to the task at hand.

154
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,333
That's it. That's what
he was talking about.

155
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,125
The world doesn't
need two Laylas...

156
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,583
The show's about to start.
Get to places.

157
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,583
I can't do this.

158
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,083
What?

159
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,875
I can't. How can I perform when
I know I'm not going to be

160
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,458
any good? And I don't have any
idea how I can make it better.

161
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,958
Well whether you know or not, we
have to start the show. Come on!

162
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,708
You're the leading lady, Sora!

163
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,000
Was it necessary to be
so hard on her, Ken?

164
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:23,000
All the new leads they face
this same kind of wall.

165
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,541
I know she's scared and
confused, but unless she can

166
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,208
get past that and do the work,
she'll never be able to create

167
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,166
a role that's all her own.

168
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,833
This isn't working.

169
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,666
What can I do?

170
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,833
I just-- I just don't know...

171
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,625
Sora, we're leaving.

172
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,375
Come on.

173
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,333
I'm sorry. I was a mess
out there. I know it.

174
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,375
That doesn't make the
audience any happier, does it?

175
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,208
Anna!

176
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,750
They didn't come all the way

177
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,000
out here to see that half-baked
performance you gave today.

178
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,375
I want you to
stop messing around

179
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,541
and get serious with this.

180
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,958
But I...

181
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,791
You and I are
gonna figure this out:

182
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,416
how to create
your Little Mermaid.

183
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,833
How to create
my Little Mermaid...

184
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,625
Oh, this is useless.

185
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,625
You don't even know why I'm
disappointed in you, do you?

186
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,958
That's right Sora!

187
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,375
You'll do a show like
they've never seen before!

188
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,708
Like they've never seen...

189
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,541
Yeah, thanks for
your help, you guys.

190
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,125
Come on, let's get to work.

191
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,750
You're right.

192
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,583
Everyone has to be able to
sympathize with the Mermaid.

193
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,041
And if I don't know
what she's going through,

194
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,916
how can I expect
other people to?

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,041
So... how are you going
to connect with that?

196
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,416
First of all,

197
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,625
you need to know what it
feels like to be a mermaid.

198
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,791
But how does that feel?

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,416
Oh!

200
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,833
You got an idea?

201
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,666
Sora!

202
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,458
Sora?

203
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,750
I'll think about it
while I'm in the water.

204
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,458
After all,
that's where she'd be.

205
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,625
I wonder if Sora is
starting to understand.

206
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
Anyway, she's got to eat...

207
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,250
Yeah!

208
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,375
Sora!

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,375
Here ya go!

210
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,375
Wha?

211
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,791
Hey, Ken.

212
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,833
Don't 'hey' me! Sora, what do
you think you're doing?

213
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,041
You can't afford to
play around right now!

214
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,583
But that's what mermaids do.
The sea is beautiful and

215
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,041
it's their home, so they get
to swim in it all day long.

216
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,125
And they don't have to work.

217
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,625
She's right.

218
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,083
And there's never anyone who
yells or is mean to them...

219
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,083
That's got nothing
to do with this!

220
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,541
Someone who's lived
like this all her life...

221
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,208
I'd imagine someone like
that would be pretty cheerful

222
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,458
and sure of herself,
don't you think?

223
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,750
The Little Mermaid's
a tragic heroine.

224
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,958
How can she be
those things, too?

225
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,166
Well, I guess I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

226
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh no. The Little Mermaid's

227
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,416
not supposed to make the
audience laugh at her...

228
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,791
Looks like she finally
cracked under all that pressure

229
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,208
and lost her mind, huh?

230
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,833
What is she thinking?

231
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,666
Thank you for coming out
today. Drive safely.

232
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,416
Yeah, thanks for coming!

233
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,625
Sora?

234
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,125
Excuse me,

235
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,375
would you mind telling me
what you thought of the show?

236
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,541
Huh?

237
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,333
Please, I wanna know
your honest opinion.

238
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,750
What are you doing?

239
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,750
Well, I thought she was kinda
cute how you played her.

240
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,416
Yeah, but why would someone
so self-assured just give up

241
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,583
in the end? It didn't
make any sense.

242
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,916
He's right. When Layla Hamilton
played the Mermaid she was

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
more graceful and refined,
so her sacrifice made sense.

244
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,333
Hey, thanks for your input.
Now if you'll excuse us...

245
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,750
What were you thinking cornering
audience members like that?

246
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,000
How else am I supposed
to know if it's working?

247
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,708
I just can't watch myself
the way the audience can.

248
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,958
Then ask one of us--

249
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,875
That's right, what did
you think of it today.

250
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,666
It was pretty different from
Layla's performance, wasn't it?

251
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,166
Well I guess you could
say it shows more of

252
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,916
your personality now...

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,166
Yeah, and?

254
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
And I prefer it to what
you were doing before...

255
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,250
Hey, Sora.

256
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,583
What the heck do you
think you were doing?

257
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,791
That's not the Little Mermaid
from rehearsals.

258
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,333
You can't just change the show
whenever you feel like it,

259
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,833
you know.

260
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,625
Before you change anything,
you get permission from me.

261
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,375
I'm sorry I upset you all.

262
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,208
I was just trying to make
this Mermaid my own.

263
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,500
Why are you even bothering with
that? The show runs two weeks.

264
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,000
Look, just do it like we
rehearsed it, all right?

265
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,750
Sora?

266
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,875
Sorry. We never meant to get
you into trouble with them.

267
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,291
I should've known it would
just confuse people.

268
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,791
No. This is not your fault.
It's all mine.

269
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,875
You weren't wrong to try. Seems
like the problem is no one knows

270
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,708
who your Mermaid's
supposed to be.

271
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,916
What...

272
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,166
I mean, you just started
public performances.

273
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,291
If they'd just give you time to
figure this out you'd be fine.

274
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,750
You're right. It's not
'only two weeks.'

275
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,875
I've got two whole weeks.
I've gotta use this time.

276
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,750
I've got to make this
Little Mermaid all my own.

277
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,041
But, Sora...

278
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,166
Hey. What the heck is this? 

279
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,375
Oh, I figured I'd live like
the Little Mermaid as long as

280
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,458
the show's on.

281
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,958
Huh?

282
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,375
I finally faced up to the
fact I'm not the same kind of

283
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,791
performer that Layla is.
And so I'm gonna have to find

284
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,000
my own version of this
character from the inside out.

285
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:01,958
Sora!

286
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,291
Hey, are you all right?

287
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,416
Don'tcha think you're
taking this too far?

288
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,375
I bet you've cut off the
circulation in your feet

289
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,041
wearing those fins all the time.

290
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,958
That's right! She's
had fins all her life,

291
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,875
so when she gets legs
I'll bet she falls down a lot--

292
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,625
it takes her a long time to
learn how to walk with them!

293
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,500
I've been trying to get
inside the Mermaid's head,

294
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,250
to figure out what
she's feeling, but there's

295
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,500
still something I don't get.

296
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,958
What is it?

297
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,333
She loves the Prince, right?
She loves him so much that

298
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,666
she trades in her voice so she
can be human and be with him.

299
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,708
But if that's true, then why
didn't she tell him how she felt

300
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,875
when he got engaged
to that other girl?

301
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,458
But how can she tell him that?
She doesn't have a voice.

302
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,750
She'd still try to let him know.

303
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,708
If she felt that
strongly about him, I mean.

304
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,500
If I were her there's no way I'd
just give up without a fight.

305
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,916
I'd find some way to
let him know how I felt.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,208
But without her voice...

307
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,750
Maybe the rest of
the cast'll have an idea.

308
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,875
So you're asking why the Little
Mermaid withdraws herself?

309
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,041
Yes. I mean, if she's supposed
to love the Prince so much how

310
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,750
can she just let him go like
that? She might not be able

311
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,541
to talk, but she can
still fight for him!

312
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,375
Hmm. That's an interesting
point your making,

313
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,500
but it's not in
our script, Sora.

314
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,583
Maybe that's why: the
audience can't identify

315
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,125
with her because she just
rolls over and plays dead

316
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,125
instead of fighting for him.

317
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,708
Yeah. Then maybe we can add
a scene where she tries as hard

318
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,416
as she can to get
through to him.

319
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,041
Maybe she could even fight
a duel with his fiancée.

320
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
That's a great idea!

321
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,500
But still the Prince
can't remember her.

322
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,541
Would she admit defeat then?

323
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,000
No, she'd hold the Prince's hand

324
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,750
and jump into
the ocean with him.

325
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,916
Have the Prince jump
into the waterfall?

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,541
How else can she remind him?

327
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,458
Anna, that's wonderful!

328
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,916
The Mermaid takes the
Prince back to the ocean.

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,041
And then the Prince finally
remembers that it was her

330
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,583
who saved him!

331
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
A happy ending!

332
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,500
It's perfect!

333
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,083
This story's always been
played as a tragedy before!

334
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,833
I think this'll be a
much better production

335
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,541
if it's got a happy ending.

336
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,708
Looks like this is gonna

337
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,208
turn out to be a pretty
interesting show.

338
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,916
I'm gonna run all this by Kalos,

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,125
and if he approves we'll start
rehearsing again tomorrow!

340
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,083
It's me.

341
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,375
Come in, Layla.

342
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,166
So I finished the filming early.
Mr. Kenneth called me about

343
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,708
coming back and doing the show.
I hear Sora tried playing

344
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,583
the part my way once,
and then started making

345
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,041
some pretty radical changes.

346
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,708
I guess she's not ready to play
a leading role yet, is she?

347
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,333
I think you should see the show.

348
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,791
Over half these seats are empty.

349
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,500
No wonder Mr. Kenneth
was complaining. Kalos?

350
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
What is she doing?

351
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:04,958
She's testing to see whether

352
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,708
the Sea Witch really
has magic powers or not.

353
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,333
Why'd she do that?

354
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,833
Because the Sea Witch
could just be lying to her.

355
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
That is totally absurd.

356
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,166
Keep watching it
to the end, okay?

357
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:26,416
What's that blue ribbon? Is that
supposed to symbolize the waves?

358
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,750
Oh, she wants him
to remember her.

359
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,375
She did it, she did it!
That's what I was hoping for,

360
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,958
the kind of Kaleido Star that
no one's ever seen before!

361
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,208
That girl playing the
Mermaid was awesome!

362
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,833
Yeah, she was really funny!

363
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,041
I never thought
I'd enjoy watching

364
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,125
'The Little Mermaid'
this much!

365
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,458
Great job!

366
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
They really seemed to like it!

367
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,000
And I enjoyed
performing it today, too!

368
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,083
It was awesome!

369
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,083
Sora--

370
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,541
Great show!

371
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,166
Hey, Sora! I've got a new
idea for the ballroom scene,

372
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,458
mind if I run it past you?

373
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,250
All right.

374
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,500
I was thinking of turning

375
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,250
the starfish into
something different, too.

376
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,708
I've gotta hand it to her,
she made the show her own...

377
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,041
She's turned into a leading
lady right before our eyes.

378
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,458
She's incredible, isn't she?

379
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,208
In this production,

380
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,875
even the supporting cast
seems energized and excited.

381
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,583
Maybe it's because they
were given unconventional

382
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,958
new characters to play. At any
rate, I think Kaleido Stage

383
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:27,958
has got a new title: 'The Little
Mermaid Who Makes Her Own Way.'

384
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,708
Junk Baron. That's the
perfect stage name for me.

385
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,041
You remember that Anna's father
is a standup comedian, right?

386
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,750
Well, we all decided to see his
show when he was in town, but--

387
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,083
That man's not my father!

388
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,416
He's nothing like

389
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,166
the Dad Anna remembers
from when she was little.

390
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,041
I feel like I've gotta
keep her memories of him

391
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,208
from being ruined.

392
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,708
I've gotta, I've gotta!

393
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,166
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'Anna's not-so-amazing Father.'

394
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,875
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
