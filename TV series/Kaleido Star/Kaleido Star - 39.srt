1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,625
Everyone, Kaleido Star
is about to start.

2
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,708
So make sure that your
room is brightly lit

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,500
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,958
Well, well, well. Hello
everyone, I'm Yuri Killian.

5
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,916
Today is the day the Circus
Festival will take place.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,958
On this day, three years ago,
I was here with Layla.

7
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,708
We were the winners.
And our glory started from here.

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,500
This time, my partner is Sora.

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,166
There's no way I can erase
the mistakes made in the past.

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,958
But this time I'll do
everything in my power

11
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,666
for Sora, Layla,
and Kaleido Stage.

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,791
Still, I wonder if Sora really
can endure this cruel stage.

13
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,958
Too slow.

14
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,208
Too early this time!

15
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,166
"Cruel Amazing Festival."

16
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,333
The school Yuri's attending...

17
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,875
should be around here, but...

18
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,791
Ah! There he is.

19
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,583
Why don't we stop here today?

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,125
No, not yet.

21
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,958
Okay, then, one more hour.
Then let's end today's training.

22
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,458
Resting is another
part of practice.

23
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,500
Okay.

24
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh! This must be
the practice room

25
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,458
for the school Yuri's attending.

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,500
What kind of maneuver
are they working on?

27
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,583
It doesn't matter.
I'm just glad Sora's safe.

28
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,458
Alice, Mute, you were a big
help today with training.

29
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,833
Thank you so much.

30
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,958
Oh, you're welcome.
Can we come tomorrow as well?

31
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,541
Oh, no! You don't have to...

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:41,000
We learned a lot from watching
you. Please, let us help.

33
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,416
Is it okay with you?

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,041
They're nice enough
to offer their help.

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,000
It would be impolite to
say no, don't you think?

36
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,541
Yeah, that's true.
Okay, please come and help us.

37
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,125
This is great.

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,666
Okay, see you tomorrow then.

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,333
Right. Have a good night.

40
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,916
Good night.

41
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,958
Sora, I'll walk you
to the hotel.

42
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,833
Well, I don't have a hotel.

43
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:02,833
What?

44
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,041
Then, you could
stay at my place.

45
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,041
I could? But that would
be asking too much of you.

46
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,541
Hi, Sora! What a surprise!

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,041
What are you doing here?

48
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,708
I-I was taking a walk.

49
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,958
Taking a walk?
But you're out of breath.

50
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,083
Are you okay?

51
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083
Anyway, if you need
a place to stay,

52
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,500
I'll help you find one.

53
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,875
Well, but I...

54
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,750
It's no trouble for you
to stay at my place.

55
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,250
No, Sora has a family.

56
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,958
She's part of the cast
of Kaleido Stage.

57
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,041
And Kaleido Stage
will look after her.

58
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,833
Thank you for everything!

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,541
Get a good night's sleep.

60
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,958
Okay.

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,000
Qui, a room is available.

62
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,208
Oh, good. Sora,
you've got a room.

63
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,375
Really? Thank you so much, Ken.

64
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,083
Then, shall we charge
the room to Kaleido Stage?

65
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,291
No. Charge it to me,
Ken Robbins.

66
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,166
And please keep this
a secret from her.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,416
Can you do that?

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,666
Qui.

69
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,583
The angel's maneuver.
I'll perfect it. I will.

70
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,625
And I'm going to win.

71
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,166
So let me see.

72
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,000
I guess the ones I need to watch
out for are Mr. and Mrs. Patlowa

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,541
and street performers
Mute and Alice.

74
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,958
Well, that's no big deal.

75
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,000
My Demon Spiral is
absolutely perfect.

76
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,250
Leon and I will
win this for sure.

77
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,750
What is this?

78
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,833
I'm going to compete with
the world's top stars,

79
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,208
my maneuver against theirs.

80
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,500
But I'm not quite fired up.

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:37,166
Something's missing.
I wonder what.

82
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,083
Don't try to jump so hard.

83
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
Okay.

84
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,625
Feel out the moment
when your body's been

85
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,000
given the most force...
and then jump!

86
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,791
And maintain a beautiful
pose as you go up.

87
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,708
You're an angel!

88
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,083
Sora, do you know
you have a weak point?

89
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,375
Yeah, I know. Ken has talked
to me about it before.

90
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,583
My body's unbalanced

91
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,291
because I've only been
doing big maneuvers.

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,083
But I'm trying to get stronger.

93
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,250
I know.

94
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,916
But even with only
the kind of basics

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,708
they teach at circus school,

96
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,666
you shouldn't be losing
your balance this much.

97
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,083
I don't get it.

98
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,750
Oh. In Japan, there aren't
really any circus schools,

99
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,208
so I never went to one.

100
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,875
Huh? Really?

101
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,458
I can't believe she
was able to do

102
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,166
the legendary great maneuver...

103
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,541
But I'll work hard.

104
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,583
I'll endure it no matter how
tough this thing gets.

105
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,375
This is the "Angel's maneuver."

106
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,666
It's supposed to give the
impression of weightless,

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,708
just like the feathers
of an angel's wings.

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,250
It's not an easy
maneuver to perform.

109
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,541
Just like a ballerina,

110
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,208
you have to maintain
a beautiful pose

111
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,208
and make your body seem
as light as a feather.

112
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,041
You need a strong
grounding in the basics.

113
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,041
I may not have all
the basics, that's true.

114
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,208
But I endured Leon's
special training!

115
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,875
No matter how tough it was,
I managed to get through it.

116
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,541
So I'll cover for
my lack of the basics

117
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,958
with sheer will power!

118
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,458
Please, Yuri! I can do this!

119
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,333
Sora, when it's you saying it,

120
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,291
I start to feel
like you really can.

121
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,541
All right. Let's continue
the practice then.

122
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,291
Okay!

123
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,000
I have to get the
timing just perfect.

124
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,500
And I have to pose beautifully.

125
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,708
What this?! What does it mean?

126
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,625
Why is Sora on the list
of those registered?

127
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,666
And her partner's Yuri.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,791
I see. He was her
way to get in here.

129
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,583
So she still hasn't
given up on victory.

130
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,291
Hmm. Interesting.

131
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,083
Now I know...

132
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
I know what was missing
from the festival.

133
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,416
Sora, it was you!

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,375
Fool, try to knock me
down by crashing into me!

135
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,458
Yippee!

136
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,208
Please aim for my back.

137
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,583
What? Aim for your back?
And I was this close, too.

138
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,958
Why can't I ever get a break?

139
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes!

140
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,416
Too fast!

141
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,375
Too slow! Pay more attention!

142
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,500
Okay!

143
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,750
Demon Spiral!

144
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,375
Her move, it has changed.

145
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,250
What's this feeling inside?

146
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,166
I can hardly wait
for the festival.

147
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,833
I want to compete in it.
I want to compete in it now!

148
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:37,541
I want to compete... with Sora.

149
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,791
Don't forget to pose!

150
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,875
O-Okay!

151
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,833
In only a few days,
she managed to reach this point.

152
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Impressive.

153
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, if she can just maintain
that beautiful pose...

154
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,833
Amazing. I've never seen
that maneuver before.

155
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,750
It really looks like
an angel's wings.

156
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,708
I can do this!

157
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,250
The day is finally here.

158
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,041
When everything
will be determined.

159
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,166
Sora!

160
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,750
Yo-hoo, Sora!

161
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,291
Mia, Sarah, I can't believe
you came. Where's Anna?

162
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,416
Huh?

163
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,458
Un, deux, trois.
Un, deux, trois.

164
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,083
Un chien!

165
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,041
Mr. Charlie.
He's the real thing!

166
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,875
She's off seeing the clown
she admires, Mr. Charlie.

167
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,416
Anna looks happy.

168
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,666
--It's been awhile, Yuri.
--Yeah.

169
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,041
Thanks for coming. The trip
must have been expensive.

170
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,125
Don't worry about
our travel expenses.

171
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,750
Sarah negotiated
that with Kalos.

172
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,125
--Kaleido Stage is paying.
--What? R-Really?

173
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,708
So I'm only one paying
out of my own pocket?

174
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,500
Well, there's nothing
I can do now.

175
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,541
Sora, be sure to win!

176
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,625
So we can be together in the
festival three years from now.

177
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,625
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times!

178
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
How can I do this if
you're throwing your legs

179
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,416
all over the place?

180
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,750
Just hold very still.

181
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,500
Agh! I forgot to bring
my good luck pendant!

182
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,750
I'm done for.

183
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,291
Ouch!

184
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,541
What are you doing?!

185
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
Oh, I didn't know
you were there.

186
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,125
Hey, you guys,
that's Yuri Killian.

187
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
But I thought he...

188
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,291
He should have stayed retired.

189
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,958
The partner he's with. She's...

190
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,125
Isn't she the girl who
paired with Layla Hamilton

191
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,250
and did the legendary
great maneuver...

192
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,375
Yeah, that's right.
They're a real big shot pair.

193
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,833
This stinks, if you ask me.

194
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,750
Sora.

195
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,291
May...

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,125
Hi there, Sora.

197
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,166
I see you don't know
when to give up either.

198
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,541
We're going to win!

199
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,083
There's no way we'll
lose to the both of you!

200
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,666
Well, I can't wait to see that.

201
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
Leon...

202
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,875
Yuri Killian...

203
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,666
Yeah. Long time, no see.

204
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,791
What? Do you two
know each other?

205
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,166
Did you meet when
you participated

206
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,666
in the festival three years ago?

207
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,875
Leon...?

208
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,666
Who ever thought we would see
each other at this place again?

209
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,333
Perhaps a match with you is
my unavoidable destiny, Leon.

210
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,666
In that case, do you
want to partner with me?

211
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,291
With me as I am now,
the God of Death?

212
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,041
Well now, you have changed.

213
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,208
I learned from you.
Or have you forgotten that?

214
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,458
You taught me what
I needed to do

215
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,083
to climb to the top
in this world.

216
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,083
You should place more value
on your current partner.

217
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,083
What's going on?

218
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,166
Did something happen
between Yuri and Leon?

219
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,583
Does it involve the
festival three years ago?

220
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,541
I... don't know. I don't know.

221
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh, you may not have heard this,
so I guess I should tell you.

222
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,541
Layla is here at the show.

223
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,541
Really?

224
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,041
Yeah, she is.

225
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,041
As a trophy presenter to the
winners of the competition.

226
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,583
What do you think, Sora?

227
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,791
Which one of us will be
receiving the trophy from Layla?

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,333
And now, for the opening of this
International Circus Festival,

229
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,833
please listen to a few words

230
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:31,333
from one of the previous
winners, Miss Layla Hamilton!

231
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,375
Welcome to the International
Circus Festival.

232
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,708
This can be a very cruel place.
But unless we overcome it,

233
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,250
there's a step forward
we cannot take.

234
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,916
So if you want to take that
first step toward your dream,

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,750
you have to give this
everything you've got.

236
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,083
Sorry, sorry. My hand slipped.

237
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,041
But I see they don't call you
the God of Death for nothing.

238
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,541
Your partners may get destroyed,
but you're certainly won't be.

239
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,500
Entry No.5, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Patlowa.

240
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,375
Ah, would you look at them!

241
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,375
Mr. and Mrs. Patlowa
are so happily married.

242
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,458
Soon, it'll be May
and Leon's turn.

243
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,875
Then after that,
it'll be Mute and Alice.

244
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
And then, Sora's turn comes up.

245
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,416
Oh... This is more
nerve wracking

246
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
than when I'm in
the competition.

247
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,041
I know, I know.

248
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,291
Sora, do you want some water?

249
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,791
Oh, thank you.

250
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,208
Hey, what's wrong?

251
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,416
Well... Mute and Alice
should have been here by now.

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,041
I wonder if anything's happened.

253
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,875
I wonder where they are.

254
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,541
Don't worry about other people.
Just leave them alone.

255
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,916
But, May...

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,416
They helped me practice
for the festival every day.

257
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,791
If something happened
to them because of that...

258
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,541
Oh, did you really exploit
your rivals' goodwill?

259
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,541
For you, that's
not half bad, Sora.

260
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,375
You're wrong. I would never
do something like that.

261
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,541
Don't pretend to be
a Goody Two-Shoes.

262
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,708
In the end, it's the same

263
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,666
as if you intended
to use them, isn't it?

264
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,375
It'd be nice if they just
didn't show up at all.

265
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,166
Let's go.

266
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,416
Okay.

267
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,833
I never meant for
that to happen.

268
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,208
I'll just check.
Maybe they're out there.

269
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,750
--No.
--Huh?

270
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,333
Leave them alone.

271
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,583
Yuri...

272
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,750
They'll be here.

273
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,500
What?

274
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,416
Sorry for being late.
We're No. 8, Mute and Alice.

275
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,041
All right then. Go to the
waiting room and get ready.

276
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,666
They made it.

277
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,291
Mute and Alice, I was so
worried. I'm glad you made--

278
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,958
Uh... Your costumes are nice.

279
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,958
You... You both
look like angels.

280
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,833
Yes, that's right.
So if you'll excuse us now,

281
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,875
we'll be doing the angel's
maneuver before you do.

282
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,291
You used us.

283
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,833
So don't you think it's
only fair we do the same?

284
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,083
But I... I never meant...

285
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,416
Did you think we were
helping you out of

286
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,416
the goodness
of our hearts?

287
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,875
We have to make
everyone's dream come true.

288
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,916
We can't lose.
I hope you understand.

289
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,291
We did nothing against
the rules. You can check.

290
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,166
Sora, are you all right?

291
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,208
Yeah. I'm all right.
It was just...

292
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,083
Well... I got a little
sick, that's all.

293
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,416
Oh, but... I think I'm...
I'm fine now. Really...

294
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,666
I told you.
Don't screw up the timing!

295
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,916
I did it right!

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,750
If we can't win this year,
we don't have another chance.

297
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,125
I already know that.

298
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,625
Honestly. I hate
the Kaleido Stage.

299
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,583
After Layla Hamilton retired,
I thought we would have a shot.

300
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,250
But no, they had to send
two pairs this year.

301
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,958
Oh! You're here.

302
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,625
All we have now are the
pieces of a broken dream.

303
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,958
All thanks to you.

304
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,250
I hope you're happy.

305
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,250
Nobody's wrong, Sora.

306
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,958
This is just that kind of world.

307
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,208
You were prepared for
this, weren't you?

308
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah.

309
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,500
It's almost time to go.

310
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,875
Okay.

311
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,208
This can be a very cruel place.
But unless we overcome it,

312
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,625
there's a step forward
we cannot take.

313
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:57,708
And if I want to take that
first step toward my dream...

314
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:08,000
Demon! Spiral!

315
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,625
What kind of maneuver is this?!

316
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,583
Can he grab her?

317
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,250
It's impossible.

318
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,083
More amazing than before.

319
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,666
Listen. The hall is dead silent.

320
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,041
Everyone's been
enchanted by a demon.

321
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,625
A demon.

322
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,208
What is this? I feel
out of place here.

323
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,041
Like I don't belong.

324
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,750
The applause should
be the same as always.

325
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,791
But I'm afraid to win it
this time. I'm afraid...

326
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,916
During practice,
we almost perfected this.

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,416
We'll perfect it here.
We can do it!

328
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,208
Angel's maneuver?

329
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,041
No, this isn't even close
to Angel's maneuver.

330
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,958
Alice!

331
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,500
Alice!

332
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,833
Mute. Hold on!

333
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,208
I screwed up.

334
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,541
Mute...

335
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,541
Mute.

336
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,333
We've never had
to imitate anyone.

337
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,875
We were proud to do own work.

338
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,625
But then you came along,
and we couldn't just let you--

339
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,125
Stop it, Alice. Sorry, Sora.

340
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,291
We want to win the festival
and get the world's attention.

341
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,125
But it's not only for ourselves.

342
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,125
If we win, we'll organize
a performance team

343
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,541
with these guys right here.

344
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,458
That's our dream.

345
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,125
That's right. So if
you'll excuse us now,

346
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,875
we'll be doing the angel's
maneuver before you do.

347
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,000
In the end, it's the same

348
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,541
as if you intended to
use them, isn't it?

349
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,916
All we have now are the
pieces of a broken dream.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,875
All thanks to you.

351
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,041
Is this it?

352
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,000
No, no. This isn't the
place I was aiming for.

353
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,166
This isn't the place at all.

354
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,250
The place I'm aiming for is...

355
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,458
The stage I saw with
mother and father.

356
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,875
It was more fun.
It was happy, and...

357
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm so sorry, Layla. Sorry.

358
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,166
I should never have come here.

359
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,250
She's not coming down.

360
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,875
She's just floating.

361
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,708
The angel's maneuver.

362
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,833
Yes, I think I've
heard of it before.

363
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,666
Angel's maneuver?

364
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,541
Sora! Give me your hands.

365
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,458
Will you be able to go on?

366
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,041
Sorry. I can't do it.

367
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,000
Sora...

368
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,416
What?

369
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,750
She's going to quit?

370
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,541
Sora. Is she crying?

371
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,875
Hey, isn't that
the Angel's maneuver?

372
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,416
I've never seen it done.

373
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,458
I didn't know the Kaleido Stage
had that kind of talent.

374
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,250
I wonder why she quit
in the middle of it.

375
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,250
If she did it all the way,
she might have won.

376
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,333
Mastering the angel's
maneuver to that extent...

377
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,458
Come in.

378
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,708
Uh... Layla... I, I'm sorry.

379
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,750
I can't believe you withdrew.
You're the worst.

380
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,166
You disgraced the festival.

381
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,750
You ran away from the stage.

382
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,791
A serious match
was taking place.

383
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,833
I'm disappointed in you, Sora.

384
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,375
I'm so sorry.

385
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,708
I thought I wanted
to take Layla's path.

386
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,250
I thought it could
take me to my dream.

387
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,791
But now, I don't know anymore.

388
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,791
What do I want?
What should I aim for?

389
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:04,000
Sora, do you really intend
to just end things like this?

390
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,500
And so, I ended up
coming back to Japan.

391
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,500
I'm getting to catch up
with my old friends.

392
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,208
I can't believe you, Sora.

393
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,708
You could have at least called
to tell me that you're in town.

394
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,208
A loving family.

395
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,375
Welcome back, Sora.

396
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,500
This is... This is fine.

397
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,458
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"Amazing and Sad Homecoming."

398
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:26,083
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
