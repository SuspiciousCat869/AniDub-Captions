1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,625
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,666
so make sure that your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,958
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,875
Well well well. Do you have
any friends that like to

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,083
make people laugh? Anna
says her Father used to

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,916
make her laugh a lot when
she was little, but it's been

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,333
so long since she's seen him
that he doesn't even seem like

8
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,208
the same person anymore.

9
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,916
And now it looks like she
never wants to see him again.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,416
I wonder if there's anything
I can do to help her out?

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,416
I wonder, I wonder...

12
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,708
Anna's Not So Amazing Father.

13
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,583
Wow, Anna, you're
getting quite a fan base.

14
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,541
Sounds like you've
got more every day.

15
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,958
Hey, maybe you should go to the
lobby and say hello to them,

16
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,166
you think?

17
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,833
I'm just about ready.

18
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,208
What? It's too much?

19
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
It's way too much.

20
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,833
You'll terrify them.

21
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,250
I guess I've still
got a lot to learn.

22
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,833
Hey, Anna? How come
you joined Kaleido Stage?

23
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,458
I mean, instead of
being a comedian?

24
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,750
Because I love Kaleido Stage.
Just as much as I love comedy.

25
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,375
I get it. You wanna use the
stage to make people laugh.

26
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,666
Well if that was your goal,

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,333
you and Sora've
already made that happen!

28
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,375
What's wrong?

29
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,083
'Standup comedian Jack Baron
will be at the Comedy Theatre

30
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,000
this week only.'

31
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,833
I've never heard of him.
Is he really good or something?

32
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know. I haven't
talked to him in ten years.

33
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,833
Oh, you know this guy?

34
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,250
Jack Baron he's my father.

35
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,416
Really?

36
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,458
No! Bacchus, let go!
Give it back!

37
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,416
Give me back my shoe!

38
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,916
Return Anna's shoe or suffer
the revenge of the Frog-People.

39
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,083
He used to do this thing where
he imitated a frog or an owl,

40
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,833
and it used to always
make me and my friends laugh.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,708
Anna, I must speak to you.

42
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,041
Who are you supposed to be?

43
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,666
Well I don't tell anyone,

44
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,500
but I'm an alien from
a star called Jaga Imo.

45
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,291
And my name is Jaga Imo jaga.

46
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,583
Stop playing with those potatoes
so I can finish dinner.

47
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,500
You got me in trouble jaga.

48
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,958
But then one day...

49
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,250
But why, Jack?

50
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,083
Please, try to understand...

51
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,583
You're leaving us?

52
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,791
If I stay here like
this I'll be ruined.

53
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:24,625
Daddy? Daddy! See you tonight!
Come home early, okay?

54
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,833
But he didn't come back. That
was the last time I saw him.

55
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,458
You see, my Dad's agent promised
that that he was gonna get my

56
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,833
Dad his very own television
series. But I guess none of that

57
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:46,625
ever worked out for him.
Well that's show biz, right?

58
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,625
You haven't seen him
at all in ten years?

59
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,625
Nope, not even once. Every
once in a while he'll send me

60
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,250
a Christmas card. I've
written him a few times, too,

61
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,375
but he's always moved before
my letters could get to him.

62
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,875
So that's why you're always
checking the listings for

63
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,041
the Comedy Theatre. You
never know when your Father

64
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,541
might come to town again.

65
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,916
Well yeah, maybe that's
one reason for it,

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,416
but I do really love comedy and
I like knowing who's in town.

67
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,291
Hey, uh isn't that theatre
really close to us you guys?

68
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,166
Well?

69
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,583
Right. We should go see his act.

70
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,666
I don't know, you guys,
part of me wants to see my Dad,

71
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,333
but part of me is scared.

72
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,333
Then we'll accompany you,
Your Highness!

73
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,875
Quit it! I told you to stop
putting your hand in my back!

74
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,500
Why are you just sitting there?!
He's trying to kill me!

75
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,500
This is exciting!
Will your dad recognize you?

76
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,041
Oh, I'm sure he will.
He's gonna be so surprised!

77
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
Oh, you're too kind.

78
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,875
Hey, thank the nice folks,
then get off stage.

79
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,083
Right. Thank you very much.

80
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,958
Hey, use your own voice,
you moron!

81
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,458
Now it's time for our next
act, and the show can only

82
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,666
get better, right?
Just kidding, folks!

83
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the stage the one,

84
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,708
the only, Jack Baron!

85
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,625
That last guys been using the
same material for twenty years.

86
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,875
The only thing that's different
is he's got less hair and

87
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,375
the puppet's got
a full set of dentures.

88
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,458
But then again,

89
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,375
I guess the audiences
have gone downhill, too.

90
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,500
What's wrong?

91
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,583
You guys don't look like
you're having too much fun.

92
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,916
You two on a date or something?

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
Yeah.

94
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,416
The girl you brought in
yesterday was way hotter.

95
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,750
What are you talking about?
I wasn't here yesterday!

96
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,333
It isn't true.

97
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,541
I wouldn't worry about it too
much. At least you're skinnier

98
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,125
than the girl he
brought in here yesterday.

99
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,458
No, wait!

100
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
Are you happy now?

101
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:15,750
Hey, thanks for the beer.
I was getting a little thirsty.

102
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,333
Daddy! Daddy!

103
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,541
So we've got a
celebrity here tonight:

104
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,750
the Little Mermaid
from Kaleido Stage.

105
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,791
What? Oh, I-- uh, hello!

106
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,625
I always thought mermaids
were half woman, half fish.

107
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,833
But this one looks more
like she's half whale, folks.

108
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,375
But seriously, people,
it's a sweet little story.

109
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,750
It reminds us that even
the chunkiest little mermaid

110
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,083
can fall in love, too.

111
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,875
How can this person be my Dad?

112
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,541
You're adorable, Anna.

113
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,333
There's my girl.

114
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,666
Let's go.

115
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,958
Daddy...

116
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
Watch out folks, 'cause before
you know it Kaleido Stage

117
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,541
is gonna turn into
a seafood restaurant.

118
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,166
Anna?

119
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,791
Anna, wait a second!

120
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,666
Looks like everyone's
in a hurry to get out of here.

121
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,083
Is there a fire drill
no one told me about?

122
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,583
It looks like Jack Baron's

123
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,750
still got one fan he
hasn't chased away yet.

124
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,583
Jack, you've gotta come
to New York.

125
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,250
You'll never be a big-time
name if you stay out here.

126
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,583
Hey, Daddy, where are
you going? Daddy?

127
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,083
Daddy!

128
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,666
Hey watch it buddy!

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,541
He lied to me.

130
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,750
How'd it look out here?

131
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,541
Another great show, Anna.

132
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,791
I'm glad last night
didn't throw you off.

133
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,458
Yeah, I'm sorry about that,
making you feel bad and all.

134
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,583
So are you gonna try to see your
Dad while he's still in town?

135
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,583
Uh no I think it'll be better
if I don't see him again.

136
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,583
What? But why?

137
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,625
Because ten years ago Jack Baron
walked out on my Mom and me

138
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:02,125
and he never looked back.
He's made it pretty clear

139
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,125
that he doesn't want
anything to do with me.

140
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,666
Anna...

141
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,500
She'll never be a comedian
if she's that nice.

142
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,708
Maybe we should go back-- uh?

143
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,958
Come back!

144
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,833
Sora!

145
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,125
Huh?

146
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,541
Wait, Mr. Baron!

147
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
Come back here!

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,875
Excuse me.

149
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,875
Stop running from me!

150
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,291
What'd you do to Sora?

151
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,875
No! It isn't what you think!

152
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,000
What, is this revenge
for yesterday?

153
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,333
No. I just wanted
to talk to you is all.

154
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,500
You were there to see
Anna, weren't you?

155
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,041
I just happened to be taking
a stroll in the neighborhood.

156
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,125
Anna's talked a lot about you.

157
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,541
How you used to do
those silly voices.

158
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,041
She said you always knew

159
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,375
how to make her feel better
when she was a little girl.

160
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,666
And then she said,
'Yeah, he used to be great

161
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,541
even though now he's
just a washed-up hack.'

162
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,041
That's not true.

163
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,458
Just face it: she's better off
without a dad like me.

164
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,541
Figured you'd be thirsty
after runnin' like that.

165
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,708
No.

166
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Oh, wait. How much longer
are you going to be in town?

167
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,541
I leave tomorrow. Right after
the last show of the night.

168
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,208
But that's so soon.

169
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,416
I'm only at the Comedy Theatre
'cause the owner felt sorry

170
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,625
for me. Don't wanna
overstay my welcome, do I?

171
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,875
Now would you take
a look at that card?

172
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,166
Yet again a silly girl
is poking her nose in where

173
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,416
it doesn't belong.

174
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,750
You've shown me that card

175
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,083
before and it doesn't mean
that at all, so quit it.

176
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,666
And all this time I thought
you were ignoring me.

177
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,791
This is the inverted Moon.
It foretells that someone

178
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,500
will acknowledge his
shortcomings and finally start

179
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,750
moving in the right direction
for the first time in years.

180
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,083
Right. It sounds to me like
there's not a better time to

181
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,541
get Anna and her
father back together.

182
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,250
You know, your father's going to
be leaving town tomorrow night.

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh, no!

184
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,125
My shirt shrunk!

185
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,250
Hey, Anna what do you
think about going

186
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,916
to the comedy club tonight?

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,583
I'm not sure. I think... I'll
go for a poached egg today.

188
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,500
Uh. You know, your father
told me he'd be eating in

189
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,416
the restaurant on the pier
before his shows this afternoon.

190
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,791
Will you meet him there?

191
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,291
Sora you do realize that
everyone in the cast has

192
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,583
been gossiping about Anna's
father for days now, right?

193
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,458
Maybe it would be better
if you left this alone.

194
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,708
So they wouldn't have
any more to talk about.

195
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
Hi, do you need a table?

196
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:20,666
Mr. Baron? Uh I know you weren't
expecting to see me here,

197
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,208
but I...

198
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,625
I understand.

199
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,875
You're here to say Anna
doesn't want to see me, right?

200
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,500
Uh. I I'm so sorry about this. 

201
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,583
You know, I think maybe if
I'd stopped pressuring her

202
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,625
and minded my own business, Anna
would've decided to come here

203
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,875
and meet you on her own.

204
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,708
Anna must be very lucky
to have a friend who

205
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,625
cares about her like you do.

206
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,666
Well I'm not so sure of that.

207
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,250
You see, I also lost
my Father and my Mother

208
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,708
when I was a child.

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,083
And I know that I'd give
anything to see them again.

210
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:58,791
I figured since Anna had the
chance to see her father...

211
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,750
But I was wrong.

212
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,958
I wasn't doing any of this for
Anna, I was doing it for myself.

213
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm so sorry for this.

214
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,375
What's wrong with me?

215
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,625
Don't cry anymore,
Little Mermaid.

216
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,083
You look better
when you're smiling.

217
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,083
When Anna was a little girl

218
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,291
that little trick always
used to make her laugh.

219
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,583
My mermaid friend here needs
a giant bowl of ice cream.

220
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,666
Hello?

221
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,041
Mom it's me.

222
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,375
Anna! How are you, sweetheart?

223
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,208
Fine. What are you up to?

224
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,666
Oh, I was about just going to

225
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,583
try to fix the window that
Bacchus broke this morning.

226
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,666
You still there?
Is something wrong?

227
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,833
I saw Dad again.

228
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,666
You did?

229
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,041
Yeah. He was playing
at the Comedy Theatre here.

230
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,500
The Comedy Theatre?

231
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,833
You know the place?

232
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,875
Of course. I used to
go there all the time.

233
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,083
In fact, that's where
your father and I met.

234
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,541
It is?

235
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,541
I worked there as a waitress,
and one day a guy came in

236
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
wanting to be a comedian.
Bob, the owner,

237
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,916
decided to give him a chance.

238
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
After that, Jack became a
regular at the Comedy Theatre.

239
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:34,083
He was warmhearted and funny.
He really was one-of-a-kind,

240
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,958
and everyone loved him.
He was our most popular act.

241
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,250
And I guess you could say he was
pretty popular with me, too.

242
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,875
But he's really changed.

243
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,291
How?

244
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,250
He spent his whole act making
the audience mad at him.

245
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,291
That's not comedy!
That's just mean...

246
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,791
Did you say that to Jack?

247
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,375
What?

248
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,958
Did you tell him how you felt?
If he's that bad the only person

249
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:04,166
who can make him see it is you.
I think he'll listen.

250
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,166
Tell him hello for me
when you see him.

251
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,625
Thank you! Thank you!

252
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,625
Okay, folks, keep that
applause going for Jack Baron

253
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,250
for his last Cape Mary
performance!

254
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,583
Go out there and
knock 'em dead, Jackie.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,083
I was afraid Anna wouldn't come.

256
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250
Guess she's just
not ready to forgive him.

257
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,750
Huh. So you guys stuck around
for that? I guess you dimwits

258
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,208
need to get your ventriloquism
fix somewhere since they

259
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,000
don't play that crap on TV.

260
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,416
What!

261
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,750
Hm? Hey, those are
some sweet looking glasses.

262
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,125
But they're not as nice as mine.

263
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,500
See? That's much better!
I put my glasses on and I don't

264
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,708
have to see your
girlfriend's face anymore.

265
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:03,416
Why don't you come down here
and say that again?

266
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,083
Not again...

267
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:14,125
Well, well, well. Nobody seems
to be enjoying your show.

268
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,833
What do you think you're doing?

269
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,708
Anna! It's you!

270
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,125
Anna!

271
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,958
Well this is a surprise.
You're just like your mother,

272
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,250
you know that? But then
again your mom's about

273
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,625
twice as good looking
as you are...

274
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,416
You know, Dad for a big
comedian you sure don't

275
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,750
make the audience
laugh much, do you?

276
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,916
Looks like you're more Junk
Baron than Jack Baron anymore.

277
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,125
Good one, Jack Baron the
junk baron. That could be

278
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:46,041
a great stage name for me...
And that reminds me:

279
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,791
didn't you go to New York
to make a name for yourself?

280
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,750
So, what, you're so big
you can only play the club

281
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,291
you started out in?

282
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,041
Ten years ago my agent told me
I'd be playing in the biggest

283
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,625
venues the U.S. had to offer.
How could I say no to that?

284
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,750
And so Jack Baron abandoned his
family to find fame and fortune.

285
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,958
And it's thanks to that agent
that I got to make a tour of

286
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,083
all the comedy clubs in
New York where I begged them

287
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,250
to let me perform.

288
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,958
How come your agent
wasn't doing that for you?

289
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:20,583
He had a heavy drinking schedule
to maintain with my money.

290
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,833
What?

291
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,500
I was turned down by all
the finest comedy clubs

292
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,708
New York City had to offer,
and then I was turned down

293
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,250
by all the seediest ones.

294
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,958
Huh. I guess even the
seedy clubs had levels

295
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,958
of professionalism
to maintain.

296
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,125
I'd been in the city about
a month when I came back to

297
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,750
my filthy little motel room and
discovered that my agent had

298
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,541
run off with my money and
all my stuff. I'll never find

299
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,708
another agent as
honest as he was...

300
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,833
Wait, if all that stuff happened
just a few weeks after you

301
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,166
left Mom and me, then why
in the world didn't you just

302
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,708
come back home?

303
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,958
Hey, I lost my shirt, Anna,
I couldn't come home like that.

304
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,083
So I kept looking for it in
underpasses and alleyways

305
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,833
and dumpsters
behind posh hotels...

306
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:06,041
It's kinda funny after all this
time here I am performing again

307
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,666
and still there's only one
person I want to make laugh.

308
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,000
Daddy!

309
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,583
No matter how long
I stayed away there was only

310
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:19,291
one person's laughter
I ever wanted to hear.

311
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,041
Then what the heck
are you waiting for, Dad?

312
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,541
You're a comedian, aren't you?

313
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,875
Come on, make your beautiful
daughter laugh again, Jack.

314
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,208
Jack, here!

315
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,750
Remember me?

316
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,166
You're adorable, Anna.

317
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:02,666
Anna? Please don't cry. If you
start crying now sweetheart

318
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,125
I just don't know what I'll do.

319
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,500
Anna...

320
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,458
Dad...

321
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,833
What do you think about
hitting the road with me?

322
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,291
That might be great someday
but I'm happy here right now.

323
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,666
I see.

324
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,500
What are you going
to do now, Mr. Baron?

325
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,166
Bob got me a gig at
a comedy club in St. Louis,

326
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,166
so I'll be up there for about a
week. Looks like Jack Baron's

327
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,916
career isn't over
yet after all, huh Anna?

328
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,166
So long.

329
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,833
Hey, Dad?

330
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:11,208
Good luck out there okay?
Oh, and Mom says hi.

331
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,416
Thanks. I'll see you soon...

332
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:29,208
There goes my Dad, Jack Baron.
The same Jack Baron who used to

333
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,166
make me laugh when
I was a little girl.

334
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,041
Why does that silly girl
bother me so much?

335
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,208
Uh-oh, it looks like there's
gonna be some trouble again.

336
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,875
Now we have to walk
the tightrope?!

337
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,708
Over a pit of flames?!

338
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,625
But this could be my big
chance to costar with Layla.

339
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,875
I won't be intimidated.

340
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,750
I won't, I won't, I won't! 

341
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:59,875
Next time on Kaleido Star, 'An
Amazingly Hot New Production.'

342
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,791
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
