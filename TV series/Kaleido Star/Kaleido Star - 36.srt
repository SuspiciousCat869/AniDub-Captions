1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,958
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start.

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
So make sure that your
room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,583
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,083
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,125
The Circus Festival
will be held soon.

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,458
It's a big competition held
every three years in Paris.

7
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,750
The world's top artists
compete against each other

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,333
doing their really
amazing techniques.

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,083
Each of them has been training
very hard for this date,

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,833
betting everything they've got.

11
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,375
Did you know Layla won
the last competition?

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,291
And she did it with
the Golden Phoenix!

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,208
So to become the real Kaleido
Star Layla wants me to be,

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,375
I'll fly all the way
to where she is.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,166
I'll do it! I'll do it!
I'll do it!

16
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,250
Oh, this is it, the list is out!

17
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,708
Really? They've announced
those who made it?

18
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,625
Do you see my name
on there anywhere?

19
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,916
Let's see. Let's see.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It'd be awesome if
your name's there.

21
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh please, please,
tell me I'm there!

22
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,875
It's so hard to get nominated.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,833
Sora... Sora... umm.

24
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,125
Nothing.

25
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,958
It figures.

26
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,916
I don't see May's name anywhere.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,875
Huh?

28
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,208
Yeah, you're right...

29
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,833
May's name hasn't come up.

30
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,333
Well, it's the International
Circus Festival.

31
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,583
They don't have their
reputation for nothing.

32
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,541
I heard it was tough
to get in, but...

33
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,041
Here's a web page for the
competition three years ago.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,125
Layla and Yuri!

35
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,125
They won this competition
three years ago.

36
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,083
It was so amazing.

37
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,916
And that's where they
performed the Golden Phoenix.

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,166
Thank you for this honor.

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,000
Winning in this festival
has been my life-long dream.

40
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,500
I've worked hard
for this moment.

41
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,666
And I believe that this trophy
will give me a new power;

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,333
the power to jump
higher and farther

43
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,916
than I ever could before.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,666
Wow. I wish I could say
something cool like that.

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,291
I wish! I wish!

46
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,541
But, to do that, I'd first
have to be in the festival.

47
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,583
Let's work hard and enter
the next festival together.

48
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,083
To surpass Layla,
I have to be like her.

49
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,500
I have to participate
in the Circus Festival.

50
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,250
That's right, it's part
of my dream, too.

51
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,750
--No way!
--What?

52
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,500
Leon's name isn't on the list.

53
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,916
What?

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,041
But Leon is so talented.
He should've definitely made it.

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,250
"Amazing Training with Leon."

56
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,958
Come in.

57
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,291
Layla!

58
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
Uh, I want to thank you
for all you did...

59
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,208
...when I was in New York!
Don't you need another--

60
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,833
Don't you need
to appear on stage?

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,541
No, "Salome in Vegas"
is suspended.

62
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:43,500
Cathy, the director, was causing
trouble with the producer again.

63
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,375
Oh. Really?

64
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,000
Anyway, the reason I came
here today is for this.

65
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,833
What is it?

66
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,250
Invitations to participate

67
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,458
in the International
Circus Festival.

68
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,625
These are called
Phoenix Tickets.

69
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,916
Phoenix Tickets?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,250
Since Layla won the
competition three years ago,

71
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,916
she has an unconditional
"seed" right

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,291
to participate in
future competitions.

73
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,583
But this right is
also transferable.

74
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,583
And she wants to recommend
one of you to go in her place.

75
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,166
In Layla's place?

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,916
You mean one of us can
enter the festival?

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,625
Yes, if you're
prepared for that.

78
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,958
--Yes!
--Yes!

79
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,500
I'll absolutely work hard.
So, please recommend me.

80
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,583
Well, I'll work my
hardest, too! I promise!

81
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,416
Working hard is not enough.

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,750
What?

83
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,375
The Circus Festival is not
your ordinary festival.

84
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,416
It's a serious competition.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,541
The participants win
or lose, live or die.

86
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,000
And they compete
against each other,

87
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,833
betting everything they have.

88
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:42,458
So working hard is not enough.
You have to be prepared to win.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
Oh...

90
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,791
Participating in this with
Layla's recommendation

91
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,166
is no small thing.

92
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,291
You'll be expected to
produce high-level results.

93
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,333
You'll also represent
Kaleido Stage.

94
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,583
If people see you giving
a clumsy performance,

95
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,291
they'll think we're
a bunch of amateurs,

96
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,291
and our audiences will dry up.

97
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,291
Leon, this choice
belongs to you.

98
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
Decide which one
of them will go.

99
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,958
What?

100
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,791
The trapeze acts have
to be performed in pairs.

101
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,583
Since you'll be the
other half of the pair,

102
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,333
you have the right to
choose your own partner.

103
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,208
What if I refuse to
participate in this?

104
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,250
If you're not ready
to win, I understand.

105
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,750
You don't have to participate.
But if that's the case,

106
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,583
then I'm the one
who is refusing you.

107
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,916
You don't seem confident about
winning the Circus Festival.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,208
Is it because you have
so many enemies there?

109
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,583
That's stupid.

110
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,166
Don't act so surprised.
I heard there are many

111
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,291
among the selection
committee who hate you.

112
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,000
They say the reason
why you weren't selected

113
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,500
for this event is your history.

114
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,208
You've ended the careers
of countless partners,

115
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,000
and they don't want to
see that happen again.

116
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,333
Ended their careers?

117
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,833
I'm sure some of
the committee members

118
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,666
will want to keep the trophy
from you, out of spite.

119
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,208
Face it.

120
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,875
This is nothing less than a
match between you and your fate.

121
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,166
You can choose to
participate and win,

122
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,250
or you can choose to
run away and lose.

123
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,625
One or the other.

124
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,041
You're the one
who decides, Leon.

125
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,041
A match with your fate...

126
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,375
Three years ago,

127
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,708
I didn't have the choice
of running away from this.

128
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,208
I had to win.

129
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,541
So I bet it all, and I won
the match with my own fate.

130
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,583
You, on the other hand,
chose to run away.

131
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,083
You're mistaken.

132
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,375
You'd entered. I saw your name
listed as a competitor.

133
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,375
But you never showed
up at the festival.

134
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,625
I don't know what kind of
reason you had, but...

135
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,250
It's not that I ran away.

136
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,791
If I'm going to aim for winning,

137
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,375
I'll have to train whichever
one ends up participating.

138
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,833
That's right.

139
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,666
Both of you may be destroyed.
I assume you know that.

140
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,416
I don't care how many people who
can't satisfy me are destroyed.

141
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,166
I only care about winning.

142
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,500
If they're destroyed,

143
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,333
it means they weren't good
enough to participate.

144
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,125
All right then.

145
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,833
Leon, wait!

146
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,208
Uh, Miss Layla...

147
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,250
What are you still doing here?

148
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,000
The stage is waiting for you.
You need to go, Sora.

149
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,166
Uh, right...

150
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,958
So Layla. It seems
like you already know

151
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,125
what everybody calls Leon.

152
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,791
The God of Death. Am I right?

153
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,208
You're doing this
with full knowledge?

154
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,375
In order to win in
the Circus Festival,

155
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,041
we need to be that prepared.

156
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,000
The one who taught me
that is you, right, Kalos?

157
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,125
I believe it, with all my heart.

158
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,458
You're going to choose the best.
You're going to choose me.

159
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,083
Yeah. I'll work hard.
I'll work very, very hard.

160
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,708
You won't feel ashamed to have
me as a partner in the festival.

161
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,625
--I will give you a chance.
--What?

162
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:59,333
I will give you a perfect chance
to show off in today's show.

163
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,833
Thank you so much. I promise...
I'll do my very best!

164
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:08,541
Ow, I was afraid of this.
Leon likes May better than...

165
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
No, I still have a chance!

166
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,166
They said he's destroyed
countless partners.

167
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,875
I wonder what they meant.

168
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,583
May!

169
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,750
Oh no!

170
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,583
Leon!

171
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,083
May, are you okay?

172
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,416
What is it?

173
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,791
Are you saying I screwed up
something?! Are you?

174
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,291
May...

175
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:36,583
To think you can't even handle
a little ad lib like that.

176
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,000
Ad lib...?

177
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,000
You did it on purpose?!

178
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,083
You're terrible!
Why would you do that?!

179
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,208
If someone isn't reaching
the level I expect,

180
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,416
that person is going
to be destroyed.

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,916
It is that simple really.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,791
I can't believe you...

183
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,916
Impressive. You're not called
the God of Death for nothing.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,583
Layla...

185
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,458
The God of... Death?

186
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:05,041
May, you failed. Give up on
getting into the festival.

187
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,000
Just focus on quickly
healing that shoulder.

188
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I'm useless...
Because I'm useless...

189
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,625
Did do you destroy me because
you think I'm an eyesore?

190
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,500
Is that why?

191
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,666
May...

192
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,958
If you want to
blame it on something,

193
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,291
blame it on your lack of skills.

194
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,541
Uh, May!

195
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,333
You don't have time to worry
about somebody else Sora!

196
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,791
But Layla...

197
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,166
If you don't want to be
destroyed by Leon as well,

198
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,291
you should work a lot harder
that you have in the past.

199
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,958
--Sora...
--Yeah...

200
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,833
Starting tomorrow, you'll have
special training. Be ready.

201
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,208
Why?

202
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,125
Why did he...

203
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:27,000
I believed. I believed
the whole time, and he...

204
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,458
So, c'mon, tell us. How's May?

205
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,666
It's like we thought.

206
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,041
The ligament in her
right shoulder is torn.

207
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,291
She's been told it will
take a while to heal.

208
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,666
So we'll have no choice but to

209
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,958
suspend the performance
of Dracula until then.

210
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,416
The God of Death. I've also
heard that said before.

211
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
The person who's
paired with Leon

212
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,708
always ends up
leaving the stage.

213
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,000
Sora, maybe you shouldn't
pair with Leon. I mean it.

214
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,416
She's right.

215
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,000
If Sora is destroyed like
May, Kaleido Stage will...

216
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,708
Sora...

217
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,208
Where are you going? Sora?!

218
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,916
You will play Mina Murray.

219
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,250
I will give you a chance.

220
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,083
I will give you
the perfect chance

221
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,750
to show off in today's show.

222
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,541
No...!

223
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,166
May...

224
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,625
May. I wonder if
she'll be all right.

225
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,958
What's with the sad face?
Is something wrong?

226
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,625
I thought you'd be happy
your rival dropped out.

227
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,458
I'm not happy about that!

228
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,458
Why not?

229
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,333
May was Leon's partner.

230
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,208
She worked so hard playing
Mina Murray for him.

231
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,166
But then he turns around
and does something like this.

232
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,291
And while she's suffers
from her injuries,

233
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,333
I'll be taking special training.

234
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,125
What will she think of me?

235
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,333
Sora, are you really
worried about May's welfare?

236
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,833
Or are you worried
that someone might

237
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,083
hate you for your
good fortune? Be honest.

238
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,916
Oh...

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,041
As a person who's aiming
to be a real Kaleido Star,

240
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:36,041
can you afford to let such
thoughts distract you?

241
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,541
Yeah, I know.

242
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,291
There are other things
that I need to do right now.

243
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,500
I have to participate in
the festival and win it.

244
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,875
Three years ago,

245
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't have the choice of
running away from this.

246
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,458
I had to win.

247
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,000
So I bet it all, and I won
the match with my own fate.

248
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,583
There's no other
path for me, either.

249
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,333
In order to surpass Layla...

250
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,541
In order to be a
real Kaleido Star...

251
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,750
No matter what the special
training is, I'll withstand it.

252
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,833
I won't be destroyed.

253
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,416
This training is not like
anything you've done before.

254
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,000
What you're about to go
through will be very difficult.

255
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,416
I'll withstand it.

256
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,333
Alright then. Until I say
you can stop, stand there.

257
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,291
Huh?

258
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,541
But, only with your right foot.

259
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,166
Is that it? Just stand here?

260
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,500
That's right.

261
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,916
I don't know what
the special training

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,416
for the Legendary
Great Maneuver was like,

263
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,750
but you will find out how easy
it was when you go through this.

264
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:41,208
If it gets to be too much,
just run away. I won't stop you.

265
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,791
I'll show you! I won't run away.

266
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,291
I'll become your
partner for sure!

267
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:57,083
It's almost three hours now.
How much longer can she take it?

268
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,791
I thought the special training
would be something amazing.

269
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,208
But he told her
just to stand there.

270
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,125
This is just harassment.

271
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,541
It could be. After all,
Leon is called the God of Death.

272
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,916
Do it one more time,
from the beginning.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,416
Wha...?!

274
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,500
What was wrong? What did I do?

275
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,375
Don't ask me such questions.

276
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,625
You only have two replies:
"I'll do it" or, "I'll quit."

277
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,916
So what do you have to say?

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,750
I'll do it!

279
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,875
Don't switch your foot.

280
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,333
Fine!

281
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,125
Today it's the left foot?

282
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750
I don't get it. What kind
of purpose does this serve?

283
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,958
I think I know
what Leon's doing.

284
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,000
He's trying to
hammer in the basics.

285
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,500
The basics?

286
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,375
Ken, didn't you say
something like this?

287
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,708
Sora not having
enough of the basics?

288
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,833
Yeah, I did. Sora was
never trained properly.

289
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,333
So standing in the same position

290
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,458
for a long time is
a real challenge.

291
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,958
And that hinders
her from expanding

292
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,625
the range of her performance.

293
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,166
I think Leon saw that
she had a weakness.

294
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,958
And he's trying to correct
it with this training.

295
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,208
But, if he overdoes it, he may
also kill her good points,

296
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,500
like her flexibility
or her muscle power.

297
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:26,041
Really? Y-You don't think he's
just trying to destroy Sora?

298
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,208
Hi, everybody. Looks like
we're having another nice day.

299
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,666
Hey, cut the small talk.
We're your friends.

300
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,916
Sorry.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,041
Sora, can you perform
on Kids' Stage today?

302
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,833
Sure. I can.

303
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,708
But even yesterday,
your timing was off...

304
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,916
It's the special
training, right?

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,625
Sorry. I'll do my best.
Don't worry about me.

306
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,958
Sora, I'm concerned.

307
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,041
I think you should stop
this special training.

308
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,333
It's just too much.

309
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,583
Uh, but...

310
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,000
Don't worry. I'll talk to Leon.

311
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,041
Ken...

312
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,166
I see. You're going to quit now.

313
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,541
That's faster than I thought.

314
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,625
Leon, I can't allow you to
keep doing something like this.

315
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,000
If you want to build her basics,

316
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,541
I'll draw up a program
for the training.

317
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,000
You've nothing to do with this.

318
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,041
I do. Because Sora is--

319
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,333
Ken. It's okay.

320
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,541
Sora...

321
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,916
It's okay. I won't lose.
Not to him.

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,666
I'll carry this through
to the end, no matter what.

323
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,125
I won't let him say
that the training

324
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,958
for the Legendary Great
Maneuver was easy.

325
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,916
Do you see her? Isn't she
the girl from Kaleido Stage?

326
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,250
What's Leon thinking?
I don't get it.

327
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,583
Sora's been on that bus
for more than two hours.

328
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,041
And she's been standing
on one foot the whole time.

329
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
I hope she's all right.

330
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,791
How is standing on one
foot going to help Sora?

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,375
Go, Sora! Go, Sora! Go!

332
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,125
Who is this girl?

333
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,125
She's the first one who
ever endured this much.

334
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,583
Sagittarius's bow is
stretched to the utmost limit.

335
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,291
Unless she can shoot an arrow,
the bowstring will snap.

336
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:51,875
Should that occur, then
everything will be over.

337
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,500
Ready? Jump!

338
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,875
Smile, smile.

339
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,041
It's like I thought.
She's burnt out.

340
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,500
Even to stand normally on
those legs, it must be painful.

341
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,041
And yet there you are.
How can you keep smiling?

342
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,458
What is this?

343
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,250
This? Well, it's...

344
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,833
It's not basic training
or anything else.

345
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,875
I don't think it's for
the festival either.

346
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,291
At this point, he's just
trying to destroy Sora.

347
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,208
Leon, aren't you
overreacting a little bit?

348
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,875
This has to be done.
It's necessary for her training.

349
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,708
Sorry, but I don't think it is.

350
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,541
It looks like something else.
Like you're afraid of Sora.

351
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,333
That's ridiculous.

352
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,916
What could you
possibly be thinking?

353
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,041
You don't acknowledge
May's skills,

354
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,791
yet you chose her as a partner.

355
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,041
And you're still here
at Kaleido Stage. Why?

356
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,875
What are you
seeking from Sora?

357
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,041
That girl is my dream, you know.

358
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,416
If you destroy her out
of petty stubbornness,

359
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,541
I will not forgive you.

360
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,916
Where are you going?

361
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,750
The special training
is finished.

362
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,208
What?

363
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,625
It's finished?
You mean, she passed?

364
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,916
That's right.

365
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,166
Sora, you passed!

366
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,250
Hey, you can stop!

367
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,708
--You did it!
--Sora! It's finished!

368
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,250
No, it's not right. Sora passed?

369
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,916
But... I passed?

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,583
Yeah, that's right.

371
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,750
You mean it?

372
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,458
Yep. Congratulations, Sora.

373
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,750
Leon...

374
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,500
No, I can't stay here anymore.

375
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,083
Let me help you.

376
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,666
Oh, thanks a lot.

377
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,791
--May...
--Huh? What's wrong?

378
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,708
Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

379
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,500
It's fine. Really. This is fine.

380
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm afraid of her? Impossible.

381
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,166
That's absurd.

382
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,500
This hurts.
This really, really hurts.

383
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,000
And so, I passed!
At least, that's what I thought.

384
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,000
But there's a final test!
And it's a very cruel one.

385
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,125
I remember now.
I'll show you who I am.

386
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,875
I'm prepared on a different
level than you are!

387
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,083
This is a challenge from
me to the God of Death!

388
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,958
What shall I do? What shall
I do? What shall I do?

389
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,083
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"The Two Amazing Demons."

390
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,250
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
