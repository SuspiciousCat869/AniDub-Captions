1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:19,791
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,708
Kaleido Star is about to start.

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,875
When you're watching Kaleido
Star, keep your room bright.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,333
Also sit as far away from
the TV as you can, okay?

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,375
Well well well.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,125
There are times when
people do something bad,

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,708
even though they
know that it's wrong.

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,375
We've all done it, right?

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,750
Usually if you apologize later,
everyone will understand.

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,708
I mean, Yuri has apologized
for the mistakes he's made

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,333
in the past, and now
he's one of our pals.

12
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,666
But it seems like
there's something else

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,708
he's done that we
don't know about.

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,750
Something to do
with Leon, Sophie,

15
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,500
and the "Angel's Maneuver".

16
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,791
What exactly happened
three years ago?

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,375
What?

18
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:54,833
What?

19
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:55,875
What?!

20
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,250
That was so much fun!

21
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,666
The time sure flew by,
didn't it?

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,500
You know I'm kinda sad
to be going home again.

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,958
Yay!

24
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,625
Bravo!

25
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,041
Go!

26
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,625
Go!

27
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,000
Go!

28
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,208
Go!

29
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,875
Umm Anna, can we please
stop doing this now?

30
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,791
Up-ho!

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,125
Oh wow, they love us!

32
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,083
Ken, time to shine!

33
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,000
Go!

34
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,958
Oh, viva la France!

35
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,958
Isn't it great to see
everyone enjoying themselves?

36
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,958
I heard some news
about Kaleido Stage.

37
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,375
The word on the street is
that we're reopening soon.

38
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,833
Huh?

39
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,166
Don't "huh" me, you're just
as happy-go-lucky as ever!

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,375
If you wanna be back on stage,

41
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,708
you're gonna have
to do something.

42
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:21,416
Something?

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,541
Like what?

44
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,583
I dunno, you could
blackmail the owner.

45
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,250
That's so uncool!

46
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,041
Hey.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,250
Yuri!

48
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,000
I watched your
Noir Circus show.

49
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,208
Very impressive.

50
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,791
I guess you don't stay
down for long, do you?

51
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,791
That's right!

52
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,958
Listen, I'm really sorry

53
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,333
that I caused you
so much trouble, Yuri.

54
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,500
We'd better get going.

55
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,041
Where are we going?

56
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,125
Back to Kaleido Stage
of course.

57
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,791
Wait a minute,
what do you mean?

58
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,666
Are you coming back to
Kaleido Stage with us Yuri?

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,541
You bet.

60
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,208
Kalos called me a few days ago.

61
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,333
He wants me to work.

62
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,500
I'll be both a producer
and a performer.

63
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,458
Oh really?!

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,791
Well then congratulations!

65
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm not the only one
who's returning to work.

66
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,541
The Amazing Fated Duel.

67
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,208
I hope so.

68
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,666
Yuri wouldn't lie to us.

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,125
Yeah, he's got no reason to.

70
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:19,791
Right!

71
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,708
Hey boss?

72
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,250
Hey boss?

73
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:21,875
That's enough!

74
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:22,500
Hey boss?

75
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,125
It's open!

76
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,708
Hey boss?

77
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,041
Yuri, I was in France, and he
said I'm gonna, you're gonna,

78
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,541
let me go, you're gonna
put me back on stage?!

79
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,833
Yes, I've decided to
extend your contract.

80
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,208
Oh thank you sir, I'm so happy!

81
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,458
I promise I'll do my
very best with any role

82
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,125
you decide to give me!

83
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,958
Your role's already
been decided Sora.

84
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:40,791
Huh?

85
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,250
Why don't you come in May.

86
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,250
Sure.

87
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,833
It looks like I'm going to
be producing our next show.

88
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,958
Therefore I've decided
to do Swan Lake.

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,416
The lead will be played
by you Sora.

90
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,166
The lead?!

91
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh wow!

92
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,125
Bu... I...

93
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,000
What's wrong?

94
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,416
She's so timid.

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,791
I thought she'd jump around.

96
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,083
I spent the entire time
I was in France researching

97
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,291
the theory of true stars.

98
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,083
Sora, you met a man
named Alan, right?

99
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,416
Yeah.

100
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,708
He said that he taught
Leon's sister Sophie to do

101
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,250
the "Angel's Maneuver".

102
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,625
Correct.

103
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,875
Did he tell you his
dream of a true star?

104
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,000
And trying to create one

105
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,416
by perfecting the
"Angel's Maneuver"?

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,791
Yeah, he told me.

107
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,875
I heard that story from someone
who knew Alan a long time ago.

108
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,500
I felt there was truth in the
idea that the "Angel's Maneuver"

109
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,583
is connected to the path
of being a true star.

110
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,291
That's why I taught it to
Sora for the circus festival.

111
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,666
I thought that if it was true
then the hearts of anyone

112
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,166
who saw Sora's "Angel Maneuver"
would come together as one.

113
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,625
However, that didn't happen.

114
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,875
It occurred to me

115
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,000
that perhaps it wasn't
the true stars maneuver.

116
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,000
When I met Alan in person,

117
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,625
I was finally able to
ask that question.

118
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:06,416
What we did... wasn't a
full "Angel's Maneuver".

119
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,041
You're talking about a
"Perfect Angel's Maneuver"?

120
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,291
Yes.

121
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,583
There was something
we were missing.

122
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,291
Sora, I would like
for you to bring

123
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,875
a "Perfect Angel's Maneuver"
to the Kaleido Stage.

124
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,416
The "Angel's Maneuver" will
happen during the show's climax.

125
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,083
It'll be a Swan Lake
performance like no other.

126
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:30,833
I'm counting on you, Sora, to
become a true Kaleido Star.

127
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,958
A true Kaleido Star?

128
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,208
Yes Sora.

129
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,291
That's why I came back
to be your partner.

130
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,166
Together, we can make it happen.

131
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,583
I see.

132
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,041
So the reason you've
called me here is to tell me

133
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,375
you no longer need me?

134
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,833
Are you saying you can teach
the "Angel's Maneuver" Yuri?

135
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,375
Do you really think that
you could teach her?

136
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,208
I'll be blunt with you Leon;
that's impossible.

137
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,333
I had nothing but high hopes
when you first came to us.

138
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,125
The man called the
"God of Death".

139
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,041
But you continue to
run from facing Sora.

140
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,541
So far you've been nothing
but a disappointment.

141
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,125
You think I'm running?

142
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,958
You've been running
your whole life.

143
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,708
I was told you even ran

144
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,041
from your
"Angel's Maneuver" training.

145
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,333
Go ahead, let's
see what happens.

146
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,708
So you did run?

147
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,791
You won't even face
me to get revenge.

148
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,000
You really are a
hopeless coward, Leon.

149
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,833
Revenge for what?

150
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,375
What's with those trapezes?

151
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,500
I've never seen
that kind before.

152
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,541
This is a temporary
set for our rehearsals.

153
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,250
We're going to do the
"Angel's Maneuver" on these?

154
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,958
That's right.

155
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,125
I wonder how they'll feel.

156
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
They're so different.

157
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,791
I can't wait to try
performing on them.

158
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,916
Be right there!

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,750
Hiya!

160
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,250
Oh, Cathy!

161
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,083
Wow, what brings you here?

162
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
Don't act so surprised,

163
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,375
it's not like I've by to
barge in and spend the night.

164
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,833
That's... what it looks like.

165
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,916
You're right!

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,375
Did you hear the
plan for Swan Lake?

167
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,583
I haven't been able to sit
still since Kalos called me.

168
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,333
I thought "Boy, I can't wait to
work on the script with Mia!"

169
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,625
Uh, right.

170
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,500
So how about it?

171
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,083
Got any bright ideas?

172
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,791
Um well I just heard about it,

173
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,833
so I haven't really
thought about...

174
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,041
You've gotta be kidding me!

175
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,583
You've known for almost
an hour now, right?

176
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,541
I can't believe you'd go this
long without brainstorming!

177
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,416
Well I just...

178
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,166
Nothing's coming to mind yet?

179
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,125
Seriously?

180
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm disappointed Mia.

181
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,583
So, anyway, would
you like some tea?

182
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,625
Anything coming to mind?

183
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,875
Not yet.

184
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,625
Okay, on this show Ken's
got his own job to do.

185
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,791
So that means we can't rely

186
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,583
on his airhead clown
character anymore.

187
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,041
Hanna.

188
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:45,791
Yes?

189
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,250
Barbara.

190
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,041
Yes?

191
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,958
We need some new material.

192
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,875
So what do you think about this?

193
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,458
I think that's hilarious!

194
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,208
We may think it is, but the
audience may not get it.

195
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
We'd better put some
real thought into this.

196
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
Yes sir, Miss Anna.

197
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,166
I had some trouble researching
the "Angel's Maneuver".

198
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,000
There are hardly any records.

199
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,000
It seems there haven't been many
people who've attempted it.

200
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,166
Well, I guess that makes sense.

201
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,250
It's not very flashy

202
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,500
and requires extremely
harsh training.

203
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,541
It's difficult.

204
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,416
The general consensus became
that anyone who attempted it

205
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,541
was a fool.

206
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,875
Now there's hardly anyone

207
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,083
in the circus community
who even knows what it is.

208
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:32,416
Sora?

209
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,208
Yes?

210
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,500
If you attempt the
"Angel's Maneuver" and fail,

211
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,291
everyone will think
you're a fool.

212
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,750
Your curtain call will
be scornful laughter.

213
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,958
Are you sure that you
wanna walk this path?

214
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,375
I am.

215
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,125
You really are convinced
that this is the way to become

216
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,750
a true star?

217
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,041
That's not it.

218
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,541
I'm actually just excited
to try the maneuver.

219
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,875
I'm not thinking about
what will happen later.

220
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,250
I'm just thinking
about the challenge.

221
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,500
I have to try.

222
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,541
If I don't, I'll regret it.

223
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:07,500
You see my parents... they died
when I was very young.

224
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,375
I'm sure there were lots of
things they wanted to do.

225
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,375
I don't wanna leave
anything undone.

226
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:18,333
Now you know why I'm always
the first one to try anything.

227
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,458
Yeah.

228
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,625
I can only imagine
how it hurt Sophie.

229
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,125
She never got to perfect
the "Angel's Maneuver".

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,958
Sora... do you know
how Sophie died?

231
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,166
No.

232
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,250
She died because I killed her.

233
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,583
It was right before
the circus festival.

234
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,000
Three years ago.

235
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,833
I saw Leon and Sophie practicing
the "Angel's Maneuver".

236
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,500
I could by watching them that
it hadn't been perfected.

237
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,291
They were good, but the
move wasn't good enough

238
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,250
to jeopardize
Layla's Golden Phoenix.

239
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,458
Or our victory.

240
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:10,333
But, what I was really afraid of
was Leon's presence in my world.

241
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,958
I thought that if Kalos brought
Leon to the Kaleido Stage,

242
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,833
then my position
would be in danger.

243
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,916
But I... I couldn't let
that happen just yet.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,083
I wanted to oust Kalos,
who caused my father's death.

245
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,500
And seize control
of Kaleido Stage.

246
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,875
On the day of the festival,

247
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,458
I called Sophie and I asked her
to meet me at a nearby park.

248
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,541
I knew she was smitten with me,
and I lied to her.

249
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,500
She waited for me, until she
realized I wasn't coming.

250
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,083
Then she tried to rush back to
the arena at the last second.

251
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,166
On her way back,
she was in an accident.

252
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,916
Leon called me countless
times from the hospital.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He begged me to meet with
her before she passed away.

254
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,833
He was crying as he spoke.

255
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,125
You know how Sophie
feels about you.

256
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,666
Yuri, please tell her you
weren't trying to trick her.

257
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
Don't let her die
with a broken heart!

258
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,375
I beg you, Yuri!

259
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,708
Please... please!

260
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,500
But it was almost
my turn to perform.

261
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,791
He knew I wouldn't go.

262
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,833
You did that?

263
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,583
How could you?

264
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,333
I can become a
demon at any time.

265
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,291
And only a true demon
could raise an angel, Sora.

266
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,291
If you really wanna become an
angel, then you must accept

267
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,583
a demon as your partner.

268
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,875
I intend to settle
things with Leon.

269
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,333
The first man to become a true
demon will be your partner.

270
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,791
Yuri's Pisces
and Leon's Scorpio...

271
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,791
The curtain is
about to be raised.

272
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,750
On a duel of honor.

273
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,750
Now if we could only
get rid of May.

274
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,250
Tell me about it!

275
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,583
Hey we all wish you
good luck Sora.

276
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:19,083
Make sure you show May
how much better you are.

277
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,541
You're finished already?

278
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,208
I really don't have
that many things.

279
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,583
There we go!

280
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,833
I bet you can't wait to get
back into your old room.

281
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,708
Yeah.

282
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,041
Thanks for letting me stay here!

283
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,250
You know, it seems like
everybody around here

284
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,125
is pretty excited about
your leading role.

285
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, I'm glad that
everyone's excited.

286
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,666
But I wish they'd at least
try to get along with May.

287
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,083
With May?

288
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,583
Yeah.

289
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,791
After all, she's a performer,
just like the rest of us.

290
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,875
Maybe that's Mia.

291
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,041
Coming!

292
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,000
Who is it?

293
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:51,791
May!

294
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,833
Is anyone with you?

295
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,625
Um, Rosetta.

296
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,375
Yeah, I figured as much.

297
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,000
Well I'm glad I came prepared.

298
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,166
I'm coming in.

299
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,041
Uh, sure, come on in...
all the way in.

300
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,500
Come on Rosetta.

301
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,166
Huh?

302
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,083
Where are we going?

303
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,125
May?

304
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,458
When I said come in,
I didn't mean...

305
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,250
Uh, what are you doing?

306
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,958
You drink cola, right?

307
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,875
What's this about?

308
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,625
I'm sure that you'll have
a welcome back party

309
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,833
with all your friends, but
I don't do stuff like that.

310
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,125
Wow, you're as dense as ever.

311
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,125
I thought we
should make a toast.

312
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,666
I hope that you intend to do
your very best in the show

313
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,166
as the lead Odette.

314
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,166
I know I'm determined to give
the part of Odile my all.

315
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,125
In fact, don't be surprised
if I steal the show.

316
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,708
May!

317
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,083
However, if you start getting
lazy, know that I'm standing by

318
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,375
ready to steal your
role at any time.

319
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,750
Right.

320
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,375
Since receiving
Sagittarius' light,

321
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,333
Taurus grows brighter as well.

322
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,166
Okay then, let's make a toast!

323
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,416
Cheers!

324
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,750
Uh, May?

325
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,458
That's not a toast,
it's a shower!

326
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,833
This is the way we
do it in my family.

327
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,000
Come on, shake shake shake!

328
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:02,833
Shake shake shake!

329
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,083
Shake shake shake!

330
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,666
Why for a second there
I was worried that...

331
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,666
Just so you know, I don't
really believe in your

332
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,458
"performing with no
competition" idea.

333
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,000
The reality is you beat me
and got the lead in the show.

334
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,916
But that's okay,
cuz I know I'll win one day.

335
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,875
You're right.

336
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,500
That's how it works.

337
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,583
I guess.

338
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,916
But this doesn't
feel like competition,

339
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,708
at least not the bad kind.

340
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,083
But maybe, that's because
we've become friends now.

341
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,375
Well you don't aggravate me
half as much as you used to.

342
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,208
Why don't you try to make
friends with the cast?

343
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,375
They're all really nice.

344
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,416
Are you kidding?

345
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
They're just riff-raff.

346
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,625
They talk big, but
they don't do anything.

347
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,541
They're not all like that May.

348
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,125
They work just
as hard as we do.

349
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,708
Sora?

350
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,791
Yeah, what?

351
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,875
Will you go down
to the stage with me?

352
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,125
Huh?

353
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,583
I want you to show me
what your stage is like.

354
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,916
But, right now?

355
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,041
Well duh, practice
starts tomorrow!

356
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,625
Uh, okay.

357
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,041
I'm impressed that you
showed up and didn't run.

358
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,958
What's the meaning of this?

359
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,958
I thought I'd give you a
chance to get your revenge.

360
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,625
You hate me, don't you?

361
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,958
After all, I am the man
who caused Sophie's death.

362
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,333
Why don't you pick up
a sword and face me?

363
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,125
This is your chance Leon.

364
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,791
What's the matter?

365
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,041
You can't do it?

366
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,791
Then I'll reveal who the
'God of Death' really is.

367
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,125
You're no 'God of Death' Leon.

368
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,791
And I know you're not
searching for a partner.

369
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,625
For the past three years you've
been living in your own mind.

370
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,833
You keep telling yourself

371
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,333
that no one could ever
take Sophie's place.

372
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,250
That all changed
when Sora came along.

373
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,375
You must have noticed early
on that she had the charisma

374
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,333
and talent that
rivaled Sophie's.

375
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,458
So you started your
special training.

376
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,875
Somehow you knew
she could do it.

377
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,166
She could perfect the
"Angel's Maneuver".

378
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,041
You were hoping that Sora
would be the one to run.

379
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,833
But she never gave up.

380
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,416
You were afraid of her.

381
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,333
You knew that if things
continued this way then the

382
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,708
"Angel's Maneuver" training
would drag on as it had before.

383
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,125
But if that happened,
you'd have to acknowledge

384
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,250
that you're nothing
but a coward.

385
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,833
And not the demon
you claim to be.

386
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,291
You're wrong!

387
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,291
The reason Sophie couldn't
become an angel was because

388
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,333
you couldn't
become a demon.

389
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,000
You don't have it in you Leon.

390
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,500
In fact, the days of
Sophie's harsh training were

391
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,750
more important to
you than her dreams.

392
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,333
During training the lack of
perfection would be her fault,

393
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,041
and your cowardice would
remain undiscovered.

394
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,958
You're the one who's most
relieved that Sophie's dead,

395
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,333
am I right?

396
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,958
What are you saying?

397
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,500
When she died you knew that your
secret would never be revealed.

398
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,458
Shut up!

399
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,333
You should be
grateful to me Leon.

400
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,166
I was the one who freed you
from your suffering.

401
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,916
Sophie's dream was nothing
more than another burden

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,291
on your shoulders.

403
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,708
Admit it!

404
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,416
No!

405
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,375
What was that?

406
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,625
Is someone in there?

407
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,500
At this time of night?

408
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,875
I intend to settle
things with Leon.

409
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,708
The first man to become a true
demon will be your partner.

410
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,666
I'm sure Sophie realized
your true colors long

411
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,916
before she died.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
I'll kill you!

413
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,375
Sora!

414
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,958
Go ahead.

415
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,958
I accept this.

416
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,625
I deserve this.

417
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,666
Please stop!

418
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,666
Sora!

419
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,000
Stop it now, this is a stage,
what's wrong with you two!

420
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't believe you'd hurt
each other, on this stage.

421
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,500
I'd accept either of you as my
partner, but I won't accept

422
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,666
an "Angel's Maneuver"
created out of anger.

423
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,041
A maneuver like
that means nothing.

424
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,000
The stage is grieving,
can't you feel it?

425
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,000
It's said that whenever there's
hatred or anger on a stage,

426
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,916
you can feel it grieving.

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,166
You say the same
things as Sophie.

428
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,125
I promised her.

429
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:22,666
I promised Sophie that I would
perfect the "Angel's Maneuver".

430
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,500
That I would make the
"true star" reality.

431
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:31,666
A true star will adorn
the stage with smiles.

432
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,833
Everyone's hearts
will come together.

433
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:40,916
The performers, the
audience, will be a family.

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,791
Promise me, Leon.

435
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,583
Yes.

436
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,166
Sophie?

437
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,458
Sophie!

438
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
Sophie!

439
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:07,291
But I... I wasn't sure that a
true star could really exist.

440
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,333
I wasn't confident enough.

441
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,666
Sophie dreamed of a stage
without competition.

442
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,208
I didn't understand.

443
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,666
I never meant to make
her an empty promise.

444
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,375
Sora is the only one who can
make good on that promise now.

445
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,041
And you're the only one who can
raise her to be an angel, Leon.

446
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
Your promise can be kept.

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,333
Time stopped for you three
years ago when Sophie died.

448
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,125
I thought maybe your clock
would start moving again

449
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,666
if you could get your
revenge on me.

450
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,625
You did this on purpose?

451
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,625
I did this to atone.

452
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,708
For what I did to Sophie.

453
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,416
And what I did to Layla.

454
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,333
You're an idiot.

455
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,750
Layla?

456
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,458
You called me all the
way over here for that?

457
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,541
You haven't done anything
to me you need to atone for.

458
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,875
The value of victory
doesn't change.

459
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,916
Layla, you know about Sophie?

460
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,291
Yuri told me about it
a little while ago.

461
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,791
A stage without competition.

462
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
It would appear that Sophie

463
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,541
had a dream very
similar to yours, Sora.

464
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,958
I still have a hard time
believing that's possible.

465
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,458
But there's one thing
I've figured out.

466
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,333
What, Layla?

467
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,291
There's something
very important I forgot

468
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,333
to take care of before I left.

469
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,458
It'll be fine Yuri.

470
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,708
Leon will become
Sora's partner.

471
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,250
This is your last chance
to make it happen.

472
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,416
To make good on your
promise to Sophie.

473
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,250
Yes.

474
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,625
I know.

475
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,875
Perhaps what I'm feeling
right now is jealousy, huh?

476
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,875
I've chosen a different
path than Layla.

477
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,750
But even on our different paths,
we share the same beginning.

478
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,875
I'll finally meet the person
that has entwined our destinies.

479
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,791
It's where our
life dreams began.

480
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,750
And it changed our lives
forever, it did, it did!

481
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,916
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"Flight of the Amazing Angel".

482
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,791
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
