1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,583
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,458
so make sure your room is
brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,708
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,083
My name is Sora Naegino.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,458
Ever since I was a little
girl it's been my dream

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,875
to perform with Kaleido Stage.
So a few months ago I came

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,875
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

8
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,166
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,000
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

10
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,250
from doing my best.

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,250
There's nothing I
can't do if I work hard!

12
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,916
Well, well, well.
What's your father like?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,458
Is he really kind
or kind of harsh?

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,166
Layla's father works
so hard that he has no idea

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,708
what's going on with her.

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,791
Sometimes he makes me
really feel sorry for Layla.

17
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,166
But, no matter what, I'm
gonna make sure her birthday

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,583
is fantastic!
I will, I will, I will!

19
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,625
So how 'bout it, guys,
can I throw in a monkey pose

20
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,208
at the end of the show today?

21
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
No way.

22
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,833
Man...

23
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,583
Oh, sorry.

24
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,958
This is your chance!

25
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,916
Quick, before the moment
passes say something funny!

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,625
That's all right 'cause... uhh.

27
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:06,583
It's no use! I'm
awful at ad-libbing.

28
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,125
I thought it was funny.

29
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,375
That's one enormous bouquet.

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,500
Yeah. I'm taking it to Layla.
Her father, Mr. Hamilton,

31
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,500
had it sent over.

32
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,458
Oh does he come here often?

33
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,250
Nah, he's usually too busy
with work to come visit.

34
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,833
Yeah, he's the founder of
the Hamilton Hotel chain.

35
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,416
Hamilton Hotels? I think we
have one of those in Japan.

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,375
Yeah, they're
all over the place.

37
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,416
Wow...

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,416
Well I'd better
get these to Layla.

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,000
He must be nice.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,083
'An Amazing Star,
Even In Tough Times.'

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,458
I think Cinderella is going to
be one of her signature roles.

42
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,083
How's the box office on it?

43
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,000
It's the best seller
Kaleido Stage has ever had.

44
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,750
Good. Who are these
Fairy Godmothers?

45
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,708
They passed the
audition this year.

46
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,166
Hello, Father.

47
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,125
There you are, Layla.
Congratulations on your play.

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,125
Oh thank you. And thanks
for the beautiful flowers.

49
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,708
They're nowhere near as
beautiful as you are, Layla.

50
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,833
Do you think that this time
you'll have a chance to see

51
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,166
my show while you're in town?

52
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,791
I don't have the time.
I'm having a party tonight

53
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,875
for some big business people.
Make sure you come by

54
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,000
after your performance.

55
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,041
I will.

56
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,208
Kalos, I'd like
you to escort her.

57
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,333
It would be my pleasure.

58
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,708
And invite those Fairy Godmother
girls for me, would you?

59
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,083
Why are you inviting them?

60
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
It'll be good exposure
for them. Besides, you won't

61
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,583
be a Kaleido Star forever.
I'm keeping my eye on

62
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,875
the future of this place.

63
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,125
See you tonight.

64
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,000
He's a very busy man.

65
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,666
Yeah. He's so busy that
he's never seen one of my

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,791
performances
all the way through.

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,416
We did it perfectly again!

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,041
It's like they couldn't wait
for the transformation scene

69
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,791
to come! This is the
greatest audience, you guys.

70
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,541
The act would be even better if
I added a pratfall at the end.

71
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,500
It would not.

72
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,750
I'm with Mia.

73
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,125
I had to try...

74
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,083
Just because you've had a few
good performances don't think

75
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,750
you can start messing around.

76
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,958
We won't.

77
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,500
But we did a perfect show today.

78
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,000
Looks like she's
just in a rotten mood.

79
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,625
Maybe she's just a little
more tense because her dad's

80
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,416
in the audience this time.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,125
But he left before
the show even started.

82
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh. I didn't know that...

83
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,708
You three.
Go to the costume room.

84
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,375
A party?!

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,583
This is so awkward.

86
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,458
Say something to
break the ice, Sora.

87
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,333
It's a shame your father
couldn't stay to see

88
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,833
the show today.

89
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,333
Well it's really nothing new.

90
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,458
I-- I'm so sorry.

91
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,083
How awkward.

92
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,000
Is that Layla Hamilton?

93
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,000
You look stunning, Layla.

94
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,541
Thank you, Father.

95
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,208
What is it, Sora?

96
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,666
You okay?

97
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,416
I feel completely
out of place here.

98
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,833
And now I'm fine.

99
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,166
I'm more nervous here than
I've ever been on stage.

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,625
Me, too.

101
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,291
They're sure getting
a lot of attention.

102
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,625
Yes.

103
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,458
Before I forget, have you
met that man over there?

104
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
Uh, I've seen him before.
If I'm remembering right,

105
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,000
he's a movie producer.

106
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right. And I hear
he's looking for a heroine

107
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,500
for his next feature film.

108
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,291
I want you to audition for him.

109
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,458
So Layla wants to be
a movie star as well?

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,416
This would be
a great career move.

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,208
From the top box-office
star at Kaleido Stage

112
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,875
to the top box-office
star in the world.

113
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,583
Your commercial value
could triple, easily.

114
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
I'll do it.

115
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,875
But, Layla... Layla!

116
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,708
Didn't I see you three
in the newspapers?

117
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:18,166
Aren't you girls the Fairy
Godmothers? You're just darling!

118
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,125
How do you do that
pumpkin thing-ma-bob?

119
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,375
Could you do it here for us?

120
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, yes! Please
perform something!

121
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,041
What do we do?

122
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,166
Let's put on a show.

123
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,666
I was just gonna suggest that.

124
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,541
What?

125
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,916
Come on Sora, just go with it!

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
Let's do this.

127
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,208
Catch!

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,666
This party's turning out
to be fun fun fun!

129
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,833
Ta-dah!

130
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,791
What are they doing?

131
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,958
Here, Sora!

132
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,375
Heads up!

133
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,041
Yeah!

134
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,083
Huh. They're not bad.

135
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,041
You should come to
see 'Cinderella'--

136
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,000
they have this triple--

137
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,041
Thanks a lot! Thanks!

138
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,875
Come to see us
at Kaleido Stage, okay?

139
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,750
And now it's time
for some party jokes!

140
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
Ladies...

141
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
Oh, hello, Mr. Hamilton.

142
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,416
I want to ask you a favor.

143
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,875
Tomorrow happens to be
my daughter's birthday.

144
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,083
We'll be having a party
at our house in the afternoon.

145
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,625
And I hope the three of you
will be able to attend.

146
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,083
We'd love to! Oh,
and then you could take

147
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,791
the rest of the day off work
after the party and see Layla

148
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,541
on stage in 'Cinderella.'

149
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,958
I have business
to attend to tomorrow.

150
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,458
But--

151
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,500
You'll be fairly compensated
for your time at the party,

152
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,666
so don't be late.

153
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,125
Hey, hold on a minute.

154
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,666
I'm a busy man.

155
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,625
I just wanted to tell you we'd
love to go to Layla's party.

156
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't have to pay us for--

157
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,750
That's awfully selfless of you.

158
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,000
But you'll never be
a success that way.

159
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,916
He's awful!

160
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,500
Well it's really nothing new.

161
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,500
Poor Layla.
She must be so lonely.

162
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,708
I don't want Mr. Hamilton's
money, but I figure we've got to

163
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:30,416
go to the party just so we can
try to cheer Layla up, you know?

164
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,666
Um--

165
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,625
So that's what we'll do.

166
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,333
But--

167
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,583
What is it?

168
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,041
Oh nothing. You won't
listen to me anyway...

169
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,041
What?

170
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,083
It's canceled?

171
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,875
Yes. There is no party.

172
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,333
What's going on here?

173
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,125
Then can you make sure Layla
gets her birthday present?

174
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,500
What are you doing here?

175
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,416
Didn't you hear me,
what are you doing here?

176
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,291
We came to wish you a...

177
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,791
...happy birthday!

178
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,541
Thank you.

179
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,041
You're welcome.

180
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,791
My father invited you,
didn't he?

181
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,875
Yes.

182
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,375
How come you canceled
all of a sudden?

183
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,875
It wasn't sudden.

184
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,208
Every year my father

185
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,041
gets people to come to
my party by paying them.

186
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,333
And that... really
means nothing to me.

187
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,333
It would take
the fun out of it.

188
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,500
That's why I always
cancel it. Every year.

189
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,541
Then why doesn't your father
stop throwing these parties

190
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,833
for you if you can't
enjoy them anyway?

191
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,625
That's just the way things are.

192
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,333
He may not know
how to make me happy,

193
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,416
but he cares about me
in his own way.

194
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,041
That should be enough,
shouldn't it?

195
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,375
But that's-- 

196
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, it's enough for me.
Now please go back home.

197
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,583
Okay.

198
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,375
I really have to practice now.

199
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,916
You practice here?

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
At your house?

201
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,750
Of course.

202
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,375
Wow.

203
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,083
This is huge...

204
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,916
How cool is that, to have a
practice room in your house?

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,416
So do you spend a lot of
your time in here, Layla?

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,708
Practicing, I mean.

207
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,750
Unless I'm rehearsing
for a new production,

208
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,916
I'm in here
a few hours every day.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,583
More when I've had
a bad performance.

210
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,333
That's a lot. And you don't
take your birthday off?

211
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,958
One of these days my father is
going to acknowledge my work

212
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,750
at Kaleido Stage.

213
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,291
And when he does I want to be

214
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,791
the best performer
I can possibly be.

215
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
But doesn't he doesn't

216
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,916
he want to you be
a movie star instead now?

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,958
So I'll audition for the movie.

218
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm going to live up
to his expectations.

219
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,333
I want him to be proud of me.

220
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,833
So you've seen my practice room.
Now I have to get to work.

221
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,125
Right. We'll just
get out of your way.

222
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,125
Then it's settled.

223
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,083
What? What's settled?

224
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,333
And then once the show's
over, our curtain call can be

225
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,958
one giant party
for Layla's birthday!

226
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,541
Wouldn't that be great?!

227
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,083
But if we're gonna do this we
have to get to work right away.

228
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,708
Mia, you'll be the director.

229
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,208
Ken and Jean will be in
charge of sets. Anna and Sarah

230
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,583
can throw some costumes
together for us.

231
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,583
And I'll find a job
for you, Marion.

232
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,250
Now there's not much time
'til the next show. Get going.

233
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,541
Hm? Well, what are all
of you standing around for?

234
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,416
Come on, get to work!

235
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,375
Once she gets an idea
in her head she sure goes

236
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,500
all the way with it.

237
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,833
It's one of the
nicest things about her.

238
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,208
I couldn't agree more.

239
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,375
So is there some kind of
trick to sewing this stuff?

240
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,416
Just do your best,
I'll fix it later.

241
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,875
What...

242
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,791
I like painting!

243
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Good job there, Marion.

244
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,291
You all set?

245
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,708
Ready.

246
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,041
I can't wait to see
the look on Layla's face.

247
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,833
Ha yeah, me neither.

248
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,583
Are you girls planning
something again?

249
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,708
Yeah. We're throwing birthday
party for Layla after the show.

250
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,916
But, please, keep it
a secret, all right?

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I wouldn't spoil the surprise.

252
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,041
Good. Thanks a lot, Yuri!

253
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,291
Listen up. Jonathan, you've
got a very important role:

254
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,625
you're handing Layla
the cake, you understand?

255
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,291
All right...

256
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,041
I think we're just
about ready to go.

257
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,625
No, not quite yet.

258
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,458
Just one more thing
and we'll be done.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,625
What? You're kidding, right?

260
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,916
Of course not.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,333
But, Sora, it's
just not possible.

262
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,958
Can't you at least ask?

263
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll ask him, but he...

264
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,791
You think it won't work.

265
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,291
Well. I guess it was
too much to hope for...

266
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,625
Hey, don't worry.
I'll ask him anyway.

267
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,666
Really?

268
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
Yes. But I'm not
promising anything.

269
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,208
Thank you Ken!

270
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,750
You're welcome.

271
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,875
Yes. She needs to
speak to Mr. Hamilton.

272
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,958
It's regarding his daughter,
Layla Hamilton,

273
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,458
and her performance
tonight at Kaleido Stage.

274
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,541
Her name is Sora Naegino.

275
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,958
Uh, well she's one
of our new people--

276
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm not suspicious.
I am a Fairy Godmother!

277
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,791
Uh that didn't
sound suspicious...

278
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,708
Excuse me, Mr. Hamilton.
You have a phone call.

279
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,125
Take a message.

280
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,583
She says it's urgent.

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,208
She says she's a,
uh, Fairy Godmother?

282
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,541
Would you like me to
contact the police, sir?

283
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,041
No. I'll take it.

284
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,083
I'm sorry I interrupted
your meeting.

285
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,083
My secretary said it was urgent.

286
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,458
Did you change your mind about
being paid for the party?

287
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,041
The party was canceled.

288
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:58,833
What?

289
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,458
She cancels it every year.

290
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,666
Layla uses the time
to practice instead.

291
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
That's ridiculous.

292
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,041
So we're throwing her
a party tonight after the show.

293
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,083
And I I know it would mean the
world to her if you would come.

294
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,625
That's impossible.

295
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,000
Impossible or not,
you should still be here.

296
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
The best thing would be if you
came for the show and then--

297
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,208
It would take me four hours to
get to Cape Mary by private jet.

298
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,750
So there's no way I could
make it to the show on time.

299
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,458
It doesn't matter if you're
a little late, just come!

300
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,875
I appreciate your concern.
Thank you for telling me

301
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,166
about Layla's cancellation.
I'm glad I finally know

302
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,166
how she feels after
all these years.

303
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,833
No you don't know, sir.

304
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:44,583
You don't have a clue,
do you? Don't you understand?

305
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,208
No matter how many people
are around her, if the person

306
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,375
she wants to be there isn't
she feels lonelier than ever.

307
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,750
I think she's really lonely,
Mr. Hamilton, and I think

308
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,791
that's why she
canceled your party.

309
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,750
Layla needs to know that you
care about her, so please,

310
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,916
please say you'll
be here tonight.

311
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,333
Don't miss her
birthday this year.

312
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,875
But her father's
never going to come.

313
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,250
But Sora decided
to call him, anyway.

314
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,750
He'll never do it.

315
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,666
I don't know. Sora can
be very persuasive...

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,750
Yes?

317
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,125
Layla, do you have a second?

318
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,541
What is it?

319
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,916
Well we heard that your
father's going to be out there

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,666
in the audience tonight.

321
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,083
He's not. Now go.

322
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,458
But today's your birthday.
There's no way he'd miss that...

323
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,250
Hey what is this?

324
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,750
Happy birthday, Layla!

325
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,416
Happy birthday, Layla.
From all of us.

326
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,083
Sora.

327
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,708
This is from the company.

328
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,875
We hope you like it.

329
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,500
And now for the present...

330
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,916
Is it...

331
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,666
Yeah!

332
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,375
Yeah! Happy Birthday Layla!

333
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
Yeah! That was so awesome!

334
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,750
We pulled it off.

335
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,500
But the most important thing is
that Layla enjoyed it, too--

336
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,750
Are you insane? You're the one
who planned this, aren't you?

337
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,708
Yes, I did.

338
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,250
I wish you hadn't.

339
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,833
I've never felt so publicly
humiliated before in my life.

340
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,250
I I'm so sorry.

341
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't you ever do
something like this again.

342
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,750
But wait! Layla?

343
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,083
What? There's not more,
is there?

344
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,291
At least take the cake,
I mean well I don't care about

345
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,916
the cake but there's
a message on top.

346
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,291
It's a note from your father,
he told me to give it to you

347
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,291
when I was on the
phone with him today.

348
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,666
Mind your own business.

349
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,458
I thought it turned out
really well.

350
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,458
You tried to do
a nice thing, Sora.

351
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,333
You did the best you could.

352
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,000
It just wasn't good enough.

353
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,041
I knew Layla'd hate having
a party like this...

354
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,125
It's a note from your father,
he told me to give it to you

355
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
when I was on the
phone with him today.

356
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,166
Don't you ever do
something like this again.

357
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,041
What's wrong with me?

358
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,833
What am I so irritated about?

359
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,916
Happy birthday, Layla.
From all of us.

360
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,541
I should've known she
wouldn't want a party.

361
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,541
But we all
thought she'd like it.

362
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,500
I guess some people just
don't like parties...

363
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,916
You know, the worst part about
all of this is I ended up

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,208
ignoring her feelings
just like her father did

365
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,000
in the first place.

366
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,625
What do you wanna do with
the cake? Should we eat it?

367
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,208
It doesn't look like
Layla's going to want it.

368
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm going to make sure
she gets that message

369
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,625
from her father anyway.

370
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,708
But Sora...

371
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,541
That might make her mad
all over again.

372
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,083
Well I'm used to
people being mad at me.

373
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,166
Sora! I'm coming in!

374
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,750
Okay.

375
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,125
It's still here. That's great. I
thought you would've eaten it...

376
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,708
Do you want some?

377
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,625
No. Layla's maid is downstairs.
She came to pick up the cake.

378
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,041
She said she'll accept the cake

379
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,541
since you took the
trouble to bake it.

380
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,666
Really! Layla can be
so strange sometimes.

381
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,375
If that's all, I'll leave
the cake here. Good night.

382
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,291
A fax?

383
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:03,083
Happy birthday, Layla, forever
sparkling star of my heart.

384
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,291
You're my little Kaleido star.

385
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,291
I guess it's always hard...

386
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,250
I just realized kids
sometimes can't talk to their

387
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:19,291
real parents either. I wonder
if every family's like that.

388
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,958
They are as far as I can tell.

389
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,458
That's too bad.

390
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,958
You could talk to me.

391
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,791
You know, if you wanted to
get something off your chest.

392
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,000
No thanks.

393
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,875
Happy birthday, Layla.

394
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,166
Don't you have any stars
other than this Layla person?

395
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,500
They're holding auditions for
the lead in our next show,

396
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,041
'The Little Mermaid.' I just
have to try for that part.

397
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,208
Sora made a mistake, then she
was so scared of getting hurt

398
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,541
she couldn't jump anymore.

399
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,875
Don't worry, Sora.
Trust me, all right?

400
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,875
What's gonna happen to me if
I can't perform? What? What?

401
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,375
Next time on Kaleido Star,

402
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,750
'My Amazing Challenge
for the Lead Role.'

403
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,583
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
