1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,125
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,125
so make sure your room is
brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,166
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,708
My name is Sora Naegino.

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,166
Ever since I was a little
girl it's been my dream

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,291
to perform with Kaleido Stage.
So a few months ago I came

7
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,166
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,666
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,500
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,666
from doing my best.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,208
There's nothing I
can't do if I work hard!

12
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,083
Well, well, well.

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,333
Does everyone know the story
'The Little Mermaid?'

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,041
That's going to be
our next production,

15
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,750
and I'm trying out for the lead!

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,333
But I made a mistake
during the audition

17
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,125
and ended up getting hurt.
Now I'm terrified I'll make

18
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,458
the same mistake again, and it's
keeping me from performing.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,458
I'm really in a pinch this time.
What'll I do, what'll I do?

20
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,708
It's lunchtime! I brought
you something to eat, Dad.

21
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,625
That was nice of you, Marion.
Everyone, it's time for a break.

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,166
I think we should
sit here today.

23
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,416
And now I'm going to
read you the story of

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,708
'The Little Mermaid.'

25
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,875
Once upon a time there was
a beautiful mermaid.

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,000
She lived at the bottom of the
ocean in an enormous palace...

27
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,500
'My Amazing Challenge
for the Lead Role.'

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,416
Great show, everyone!

29
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:54,416
Freedom! Yeah, I've been
wanting a vacation for so long

30
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,083
but now I don't know what to do.

31
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,166
I'm practicing.

32
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,916
We've gotta be
ready for the audition.

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,416
Didn't you hear about this? It's
on the last day of our vacation.

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,083
Nobody's told me
about an audition! Why?

35
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,625
It's posted on the bulletin
board at the dormitory.

36
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:11,916
So what's it for?

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Last summer's production

38
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,416
of 'The Little Mermaid' was so
popular they're remounting it.

39
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,250
Whoa!

40
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,833
Uh, is something wrong?

41
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,791
I saw this show on video and it
was the most amazing thing ever!

42
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,708
I can't believe I'll
get to see it in person!

43
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,583
And now I might even get
a chance to be in it!

44
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,208
Oh, and it's the saddest
story, especially when

45
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,541
the Little Mermaid jumps off the
ship at the end-- every time

46
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,958
I see that I just cry and cry
and cry and cry and cry

47
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,333
and cry and cry...

48
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,916
All right, we get it.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,791
And since Layla's wanting to try
out a few new trapeze maneuvers,

50
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,333
I heard they're looking for

51
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,541
a supporting cast
with trapeze experience.

52
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,708
Wow.

53
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,291
This could be your chance, Sora.

54
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,291
What?

55
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,583
'Cause the trapeze
is your thing.

56
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,083
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,166
After all, you mastered the
Golden Phoenix, didn't you?

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,416
Yeah...

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,916
Just think: you could
be a supporting player.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,916
You really think so? Maybe
I should start practicing...

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,250
And the pay's higher
for supporting roles, too.

62
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,375
No way!

63
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,375
And they provide you
with a chauffeur.

64
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,916
Really? But what would
I need a chauffeur for?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,250
Can you believe her?

66
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,750
She's acting like
she's already been cast.

67
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,833
Ugh, she makes me wanna hurl.

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,875
But there was a problem:
in order to trade her fins

69
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,875
for feet, the
Little Mermaid had to--

70
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,708
What in the world is going--
Oh, I'm sorry...

71
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,458
...uh, hi.

72
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,916
How are your
preparations coming along?

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,833
Everything is going
very smoothly.

74
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,875
I'm glad to hear it. Well, are
you gonna show me the production

75
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,666
or stand out here
and talk all day?

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,625
We haven't held auditions yet,
there's nothing to show.

77
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,750
Enough with your excuses, I want
to see where my money's going.

78
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,708
Show me what
you've got or deal's off.

79
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,416
Well I'm prepared to do
a scene for you if you'd like.

80
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,833
I mean, that way you'd
at least see something.

81
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,541
We're all aware that you're
a wonderful performer.

82
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,083
But doesn't Kaleido Stage
have anyone else?

83
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,916
Layla's good but I get
tired of seeing her show

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,416
after show after show.

85
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,291
Huh. That old man is just
as mean as the sea witch

86
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,958
in 'The Little Mermaid,'
isn't he Jonathan?

87
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,750
So have you got someone else?

88
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,500
In short, the audition
will be today and it will be

89
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,333
in front of our producer.

90
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,625
If one of you successfully
completes the audition

91
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,208
you'll play the title role.

92
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,791
However, if none of you
succeed we will be canceling

93
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,333
'The Little Mermaid's
run this summer.

94
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,250
That said, is anyone
ready to audition?

95
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,500
So if you screw up
the whole show's canceled?

96
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,416
Sounds too risky for me...

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
So none of you want to audition?

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,708
Sora, this is a great chance.
Why don't you do it?

99
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,666
You could be the
leading lady, you know.

100
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,166
Me as the Little Mermaid...?

101
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,916
What's that?
You say something, Boss?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,833
That settles it then.

103
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,166
What?

104
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,666
Sora, you'll be auditioning
for the role today.

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Me? But I thought the Little
Mermaid was Layla's part.

106
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,333
So what?

107
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,708
Weren't you just bragging
about your trapeze work?

108
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,833
I mean, it is
your specialty, right?

109
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,208
Huh.

110
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,333
And weren't you just
complaining about your salary?

111
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,000
Saying you should be
paid ten times more...

112
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,500
You know, so you could
buy that tropical island...

113
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,208
Well, Sora if you want
that much more money,

114
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,208
I highly recommend you take a
crack at this audition today.

115
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
But--

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,458
Is everything ready?

117
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,458
Ready.

118
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,000
Uh, Ken? What am I
supposed to do?

119
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,583
Don't worry, Sora.

120
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm going to walk you through
everything you need to do, okay?

121
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,791
You're going to have to swing
from where you're standing

122
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,750
right now to the trapeze on
the other side of the set.

123
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,791
You'll do that when
I press the buzzer.

124
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,583
If you jump when I buzz, you'll
be in synch with the swing

125
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,041
on the other side
of the waterfall.

126
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,333
Waterfall? What are
you talking about?

127
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,750
We're ready when you are.

128
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,541
Yes, sir. We're starting.

129
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,833
Hey you'll do great,
just jump when I buzz, okay?

130
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,208
Jump when you hit
the buzzer, right.

131
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,416
So I can't see where I'm jumping
to because of the waterfall.

132
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
What am I gonna do?

133
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,166
Stop worrying and just do it!

134
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,833
Sora!

135
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,458
No, you're too late! Come back!

136
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,666
I-- I'm gonna make it!

137
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,875
Oh no.

138
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,375
But I-- I thought I had it.

139
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
Oh no...

140
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,708
I'm so glad. It's
good to see you awake.

141
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,625
You saved me, didn't you?

142
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,708
Yes. Well, you're talking,
so I think you'll be fine.

143
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,708
Uh, yes.
Thank you for everything.

144
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,500
Well I should be leaving now.

145
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,583
What? Oh no wait!
Where where are you going?

146
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,208
Our castle, Kaleido Stage.

147
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,625
Take me with you!

148
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,958
I'm sorry, but you
can't come this way.

149
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,083
Why not?

150
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
You'll never make it up there.

151
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,250
You should go back to
the world you belong to.

152
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:31,291
No. Please don't leave me here.
Don't go! Please come back!

153
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,041
Come back!

154
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,708
Don't leave me...

155
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,708
Hey! She's awake now.

156
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,208
Sora, are you okay?

157
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,916
I don't have fins. Thank god.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,125
What was that?

159
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,333
Sora, you should
really take it easy.

160
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,000
They said that you slightly
dislocated your shoulder.

161
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,208
But if Yuri hadn't been there,

162
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,750
you'd be in a lot
worse shape right now.

163
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,541
What?

164
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,916
When Yuri saw you falling

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,291
he ran and he jumped on
stage to try and catch you.

166
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,458
And he had to give you
mouth-to-mouth and everything,

167
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,833
Sora.

168
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,666
So it wasn't just
a dream after all...

169
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,375
And then, when Ken saw Yuri
doing that, he got all --

170
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,500
Oh, I forgot about that.

171
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,875
Yeah, Ken got really
weird about it...

172
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,166
What?

173
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,625
Sora! Just what do you
think you're doing?!

174
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,875
What?

175
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,625
You know what!

176
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,500
You're supposed
to be taking it easy.

177
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,291
Didn't the doctor tell you
not to do this yet?

178
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,375
Oh, I'll be fine. I've gotta
show the producer I can do this

179
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,166
or else he'll cancel the show.

180
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,333
What what's wrong with me?

181
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,541
What-- oh my gosh,
what's going on?

182
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:47,791
I can't stop shaking.
What's wrong with me?

183
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,625
Sora. Sora.
Can you hear me? Sora?

184
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,916
What-- what happened?

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,916
You need to take it easy, okay?

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,083
Oh yeah, you know I think
you're right. I guess I'm not

187
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,833
quite healed yet. I think
I'll just go home and rest.

188
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,166
Wait a second.

189
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,375
What is it?

190
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,666
You need to tell me
the truth about this.

191
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,041
Are you afraid to swing again?

192
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,666
That's it, isn't it?
Sora if you're scared...

193
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,166
Hey Ken, why don't you
just butt out, okay?

194
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,583
You've gotta stop her.

195
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,000
Sora, you-- 

196
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:26,833
What up--

197
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,083
Sora...

198
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,333
What just happened here?

199
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,500
So how did it go?

200
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,791
I talked him into giving us
another chance next week.

201
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,583
Now we've just gotta hope
our performer's up for it.

202
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,375
Sora! Hey, Sora! The
dining hall's closing soon!

203
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,083
You're never gonna get better
if you don't eat something!

204
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,750
Please. Just leave me alone.

205
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,583
Oh, how pathetic.

206
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,125
You're so annoying.

207
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,625
Why did you skip practice today?

208
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,416
Because I'm injured, all right?

209
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,166
So injured you
can't get out of bed?

210
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,583
Look, my shoulder hurts...

211
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,791
How come?

212
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,000
Who cares? Just leave
me alone, all right?

213
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,625
You're going to end up like him.

214
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,958
Like who?

215
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,458
He was a man that was able
to see me a while ago.

216
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,541
And, just like you, he injured
himself on the trapeze.

217
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,166
He was never able to swing
again, too afraid of being hurt.

218
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,208
So did he have to
leave Kaleido Stage?

219
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,291
No.

220
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,958
How'd he do it? How did he
finally get rid of his fear?

221
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,500
So I was right:

222
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,083
none of this has anything to
do with your shoulder injury.

223
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,916
Hey, don't change the
subject, how'd he do it?

224
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,291
What's this?

225
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,916
The Hanged Man.

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you want to change
your current situation,

227
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,708
you need to face your fears.

228
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,458
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,125
The man that I was just telling
you about gradually became

230
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,666
unable to see me, Sora.

231
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,083
What is this...?

232
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,458
Sora.

233
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,083
Ken?

234
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,125
I knew you'd come back. I knew
you couldn't stay away for long.

235
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,666
I I'm sorry that
I snapped at you.

236
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,125
Hey, don't worry about it. I
never gave it a second thought.

237
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,291
I'm just so glad
you're back to practice.

238
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,583
After all, I set up
the trapeze for you.

239
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,875
So you set this up for me?

240
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,666
I worked all afternoon. So
that you'd feel comfortable.

241
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,291
I don't know what to say...

242
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,958
Well I should've guessed
you might be afraid

243
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,291
to get back up there.

244
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,666
How could you? I didn't
even know myself. But Ken,

245
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,833
don't you think these swings are
a little too low to practice on?

246
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,208
Well, the first thing we've
gotta do is get your confidence

247
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,958
back up, to erase the memory
of falling and being injured

248
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,166
from your mind.

249
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,666
How are we supposed to do that?

250
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,166
Practice. You'll just
keep doing it right 'til

251
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,583
you can't even remember
having done it wrong.

252
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,500
Still, don't you think having
them so low is just too easy?

253
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,500
You'll never know
unless you try.

254
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,541
I can't do this blind, Ken!

255
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,500
The blindfold's so you can
picture yourself doing it right.

256
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,708
But Ken--

257
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,541
I'll coordinate
the timing, okay?

258
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,958
Just jump after
I give the signal.

259
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,208
Are you ready, Sora?
I'm going to start.

260
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,250
Forget about the time
you made a mistake.

261
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,250
Just concentrate on
synchronizing with the sound.

262
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,375
Let's do this. One two three.

263
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,250
Sora, are you all right?

264
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,000
No, I'm sorry, Ken, but I I
just can't do this anymore.

265
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
Don't say that,
of course you can.

266
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

267
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,083
Sora, listen to me.
You've got to trust me, okay?

268
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,916
There is no way
I'm going to let you fall.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,416
I can't rescue you like Yuri
did, but I'm going to make sure

270
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,541
you play the Little Mermaid.

271
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,416
What do you say?

272
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,875
Okay. I'm ready to try it again.

273
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,416
One more time then?

274
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes.

275
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,625
Who is this?

276
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,916
Sora, this is Master Lin,
my kung-fu teacher.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,625
We thought he could teach you
his method of concentration,

278
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,291
so you can focus better when
you're up there on the trapeze.

279
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,708
What?

280
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,750
Stop whining, just try it.

281
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,541
Excellent! Master Lin
wants to give you a test.

282
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,750
Huh?

283
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,958
Oh, that means that if you can
keep up with him he'll teach you

284
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,791
his concentration method.

285
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,791
Right. Just don't be
too hard on me.

286
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,708
Oh wait...

287
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,333
Congratulations, Sora,
you passed the test.

288
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,041
What, I did?!

289
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,041
That's right.

290
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,458
Now take a deep breath
and try to clear your mind.

291
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,791
I'm all right.
Let's do it again.

292
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,125
I just can't get it.

293
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,708
Of course you can.

294
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,750
Master Lin says you've
shown amazing progress with

295
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,541
his concentration method.

296
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,750
Really?

297
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,666
You should really be
proud of yourself, Sora.

298
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,041
He's starting to move on to his
most advanced lessons for you.

299
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,416
What are you waiting for?

300
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,375
You can't expect him to
hold that position all day.

301
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,083
Sorry.

302
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,333
Clear all the clutter from your
mind and become one with nature.

303
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,916
Then you will be the wind,
the water and the earth.

304
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,916
You must become one with
all that surrounds you.

305
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,333
Only then will you know the
secret of true concentration.

306
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,250
Sora!

307
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,583
I must become one
with my surroundings...

308
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,916
Maybe we should take a break.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,750
No, I wanna keep working.

310
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,375
I'm pretty sure
I've got it this time.

311
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,166
Well, Sora, it's almost
time for the audition.

312
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,041
But I was hoping to have
a little more recovery time.

313
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,250
The doctor tells me your
shoulder's completely healed.

314
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,166
Don't tell me you're
afraid of falling again.

315
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,583
If you're telling me you can't
perform, there's no reason

316
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,416
for you to be here anymore.

317
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,958
...there's no reason for you
to be here anymore...

318
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,666
Calm down, Sora. You have
nothing to worry about.

319
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,166
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,000
He just threatened to fire me
if I couldn't do it, okay?

321
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,666
But you know that
you can do this, Sora.

322
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,208
It was just practice! That's the
only reason I didn't freeze.

323
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,583
I'll never be able to do it
when it really counts!

324
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,666
I just can't swing anymore!

325
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,291
I can't... I can't...
I don't want to fall!

326
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,583
So you're giving it up
for the rest of your life?

327
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,000
A long time ago I decided
I couldn't swing again because

328
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,000
I was too afraid of being hurt.

329
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,125
I couldn't jump
even if I wanted to.

330
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,083
I felt the same way you
must be feeling right now.

331
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,750
But the truth
is you can do this.

332
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,333
When you were practicing the
Golden Phoenix I had no idea

333
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,375
how you could keep getting up
on that trapeze even though

334
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,291
it was such a tough practice.

335
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,416
But you mastered it. There are
a lot of great performers here

336
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,208
at Kaleido Stage, but, Sora,
you're the only one who ever

337
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,583
made me wish I hadn't quit.

338
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,833
Just try to remember

339
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,458
how good it feels when
you're performing, Sora.

340
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,625
Remember how good it feels
when you're performing...

341
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,625
Please don't give up.
You've got to try again.

342
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,500
I don't want my Sora
ruled by fear.

343
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,541
Sora...

344
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,375
Thank you, for everything.

345
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,833
Sora!

346
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,375
A blindfold?
Is she gonna make it?

347
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,125
Of course she will.
Start when you're ready.

348
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,083
Yes, sir. Let's do this,
Sora. Are you ready to go?

349
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,125
All right, then here we go.
One and two and three!

350
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,416
If you're telling me you can't
perform, there's no reason

351
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,541
for you to be here anymore.

352
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,916
Clear all the clutter from your
mind and become one with nature.

353
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,541
Then you will be the wind,
the water and the earth.

354
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,583
You must become one with
all that surrounds you.

355
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,541
Amazing!

356
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,833
You did it, Sora. You really
are the most incredible person

357
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:32,625
at Kaleido Stage.
You really are...

358
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,750
Congratulations! You're going
to be the Little Mermaid!

359
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,958
And so I got my
first leading role ever!

360
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,375
I tried to be just as good
as Layla was, but...

361
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,333
Our audiences
are getting smaller.

362
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,458
And our producer
isn't very happy.

363
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:56,000
I just don't get it. What am I
doing wrong? What, what, what?!

364
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,833
Next time on Kaleido Star,
'Facing an Amazing Wall.'

365
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,833
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
