1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,708
Hey everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,958
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,708
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:04,083
There are challengers,
adventurers, and pioneers,

5
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,458
those people whom
we commonly label 'fools.'

6
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,875
Wise people follow those fools.

7
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,833
They praise those who succeed
and laugh at those who fail.

8
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,125
Such is the way of the world.

9
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,250
But a true star will never
stop trying to be her best.

10
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,291
No mockery can stop her.

11
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,458
A fool aims for goals
no one has yet reached.

12
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:31,000
She aims to be a Kaleido Star
like no one has ever seen.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,291
Sora Naegino,

14
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't accept that you're
the next Kaleido Star.

15
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,500
No, I don't.

16
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,458
"An Amazing New Rival."

17
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,208
He's just so wonderful.

18
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,291
Those mysterious eyes of his
are just so irresistible.

19
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,916
Mr. Leon!

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
I'll get to see him any second.

21
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,458
Mom, will Sora be in the show?

22
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,666
Will she have a big part?

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,791
Yes.

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,083
Where's Sora?

25
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:27,916
Is she here yet, Mia?

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,291
No, not yet.

27
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,166
Ken, she's not in the
lobby or the dressing room!

28
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,000
I wonder where she went.

29
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,250
That Sora is
a very naughty girl.

30
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't get it Miss Sarah,
why are you laughing?

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:42,000
I have a feeling that our little
Sora is doing something absurd.

32
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,541
Well I still don't
see why that's funny.

33
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,666
She's such a big star
now that maybe she thinks

34
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,958
she's allowed to be
late on opening day.

35
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,333
Marion, aren't you

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,041
supposed to be helping your
father right about now?

37
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,541
No, not really.

38
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:00,000
And to tell you the truth,
I just came to see Leon Oswald.

39
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,666
Oh, of course.

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,833
He is the prince
of the French circus,

41
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,500
the Pegasus of the stage.

42
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,208
The most talented performer
in the whole world!

43
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,541
But no one knows his past...

44
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
He's so mysterious.

45
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,583
There's no time
for this conversation.

46
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,916
This is the first day

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
she's going to appear
on stage with Mr. Oswald.

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,541
And she still doesn't believe

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,291
she can draw an
audience by herself.

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,875
Sora! Where could you be?

51
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,833
I found her.

52
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,166
Look!

53
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,208
What?

54
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,791
What is she doing?

55
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,750
With Layla gone, we've lost
some of our audience, so...

56
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,958
I think Sora's trying

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,083
to win them back by
advertising the show.

58
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,000
Uh, dang it!

59
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,583
I'm going too!

60
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,791
Please don't, Anna!

61
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,375
So I can't go?

62
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,208
Everybody!
Kaleido Stage is fun!

63
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,416
So come-

64
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,666
There.

65
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,125
She did it!

66
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,375
You're great!

67
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,375
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

68
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,791
I wonder if that helped
with the advertising.

69
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,375
You guys, please come see
Kaleido Stage, okay?

70
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,583
It's a wonderful show that
combines an interesting play

71
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,791
with some amazing
acrobatic elements.

72
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,416
I've seen something like that.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,333
And Layla's not in it, is she?

74
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,083
Hey, could you do
that trick for us again?

75
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,208
Please.

76
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,000
But, I have to get
going, soon. Sorry.

77
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,083
You can do it.

78
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,250
Come on, do the trick.

79
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,416
Do the trick that you-

80
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,750
All right, I'll do it
just one more time.

81
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,166
Shoot, I'm gonna have to
hurry or I'll really be late.

82
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,625
Oh, I'll take a shortcut.

83
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,250
Please come see the
new show at Kaleido Stage.

84
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,333
Huh?

85
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,333
Please come see the
new show at Kaleido Stage.

86
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,166
The top performer in
the world, Leon Oswald,

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,750
will be appearing on
the stage starting today.

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,708
Saiyuki is a love story.

89
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,541
We can't start the
show without Sora,

90
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,333
she's playing the princess.

91
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,083
Everyone just concentrate
on getting ready.

92
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,208
Oh, here she comes.

93
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,500
Sora has arrived.

94
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,875
Everybody, get to places.

95
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,375
We're starting.

96
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,916
I'm sorry.
I lost track of time.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,375
You're so late!

98
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,666
What were you thinking?

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, Boss, I was-I was just
thinking that Mr. Oswald came

100
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,458
all this way, so I thought I'd
do a little advertising for it.

101
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,666
You'd do well to keep your
mind on your work from now on.

102
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,500
But, I was thinking
about the show.

103
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,375
Even a trained seal
could get us publicity.

104
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,458
Huh?

105
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,416
Could you really?

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,041
I can understand why
he's upset with me,

107
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,458
but still, my name alone can't
draw the kind of audience

108
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,291
that Layla's could,
and that's why...

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,208
I'm sorry!

110
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,708
You're really hopeless.

111
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,208
Go change your clothes!

112
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,541
Okay!

113
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:19,666
Oh, Mr. Oswald, I'm really
sorry for being late.

114
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm gonna do my best.

115
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
I look forward to sharing
the stage with you.

116
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,458
You don't need
to appear on stage.

117
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,583
But, I-

118
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,000
I can do the show myself.

119
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,916
He is so cool!

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,125
Except he shouldn't have said
something like that to you.

121
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,916
What are you gonna do?

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,833
I'll just go on stage
anyway, of course.

123
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,500
Doing the show all by himself.

124
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,666
I don't think he
was really serious.

125
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,333
I've gotta change.

126
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,791
Oh no, I can't reach.

127
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,958
You know, if you want,
I can help you get that off.

128
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,250
Thank you.

129
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,791
Fool?

130
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,916
I just need help taking off
this costume, and nothing else.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,291
I know what you meant.

132
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,166
Okay, go ahead.

133
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,291
Right.

134
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,166
Darn.

135
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,500
You just said "darn" didn't you?

136
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,916
"Darn"?

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,333
I did not. Now stay still,
you don't have much time.

138
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,500
Darn.

139
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,583
You just said it again.
You did, you did, Fool!

140
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,208
Aren't you in a hurry?

141
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,833
I thought you'd go to heaven

142
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,791
or something, once we perfected
the legendary great maneuver.

143
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,541
I'm the spirit of the stage,

144
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,416
not some kind of ghost.

145
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,291
I made Mr. Oswald mad, but
he'll forgive me if he sees

146
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,875
I'm working really hard to make
this performance exciting,

147
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,083
don't you think?

148
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,625
Your sign is Sagittarius.

149
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,125
Those born under this sign head
straight for their dreams,

150
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,708
but you don't have
enough radiance yet.

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,875
You still have a long way
to go to become a star.

152
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm putting all
my faith in you, Sora.

153
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,500
You want me to be
your dream, Layla?

154
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,833
I do, because I know
you have what it takes

155
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,125
to be a true Kaleido Star.

156
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,375
I am.

157
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,291
Don't be depressed.

158
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,208
If you can still see me, that
means that you still have-

159
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm fine. Leave me alone!

160
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,708
I'll just have to do my best, no
matter what happens out there!

161
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,416
And that's all!
That's all! That's all!

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,791
Huh?

163
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,291
Oh yeah.

164
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,541
How cute!

165
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,208
Good, they like it!

166
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,791
It's one of my plans
working just fine.

167
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,666
Now on to phase two.

168
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,916
Why did I agree to this?

169
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,958
Hopefully Mr. Oswald
will think...huh?

170
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,375
He's not there.
What happened to him?

171
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,083
Where could he have gone to?

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,458
Hey wait a minute,
I can't believe this.

173
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,458
Is he really gonna leave?

174
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,041
What is going on?

175
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
Mr. Oswald!

176
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,375
Please, go back out on stage.

177
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,625
Change of plans.

178
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,541
Let's bring the
clowns out right now.

179
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,916
Hello!

180
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,666
I... oh, please don't go!

181
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,666
The show's not even over.

182
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,041
If we're just going to
show them amateurish stunts,

183
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,708
I'd rather not perform at all.

184
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,875
But that's not fair to all the
people who came to see the show.

185
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,666
The audience came
to see me at my best.

186
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,541
Doing a show in which
I don't shine is pointless.

187
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,166
But isn't the whole point
of doing a show like this

188
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,500
to entertain the audience
and make them happy?

189
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,458
We owe it to them
to at least finish.

190
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,333
You've got it backwards.

191
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,916
I did not come here
for the audiences.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,875
The audiences came here for me.

193
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,666
I have the best technical
skills in the world.

194
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,625
The only reason the audience
came is to admire them.

195
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,875
If I knew Kaleido Stage
was a place that put on

196
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,250
stupid performances to curry
favor with the audience,

197
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,833
I never would have come
in the first place.

198
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,250
There are kids out there
who don't know anything

199
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,875
about you or your skills.

200
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,166
So what about them?

201
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm not performing
for little kids.

202
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,875
Who would have guessed that

203
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,916
the one who perfected the
legendary great maneuver

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
would be this kind of person.

205
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,541
I should never have come here.

206
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,541
You know, you may have the best
technical skills in the world,

207
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:47,041
but that doesn't change the
fact that I don't like you.

208
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,250
But I understand that

209
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,541
Kaleido Stage needs you
out there right now.

210
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,041
Because my skills alone

211
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,666
can't draw the kind of audiences
that we used to get here.

212
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,666
So, please, I'm asking you to
go back on stage, Mr. Oswald.

213
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,916
No way.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,375
The clowns' routine
is almost over.

215
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,083
What?

216
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
Oh no, what do we do?

217
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,083
We have no choice.

218
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,250
We'll have to cancel the show.

219
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,750
Is that okay, Boss?

220
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,791
All right.

221
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,791
You can't!

222
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,333
You can't cancel the show!

223
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,583
If he won't go back on stage,

224
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,750
I'll finish the
whole thing by myself.

225
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,125
What?

226
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,583
That's going to be interesting.

227
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,166
If I can finish the show by
myself, will you promise not to

228
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,083
leave Kaleido Stage?

229
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,625
I won't promise any such thing.

230
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,041
If you want to pull a
stunt like this, go ahead.

231
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,333
But you should learn that

232
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,791
the audience is a
performer's greatest enemy.

233
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,833
What do you mean the
audience is my enemy?

234
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,750
Finishing the show means you'll
have to do all of your maneuvers

235
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
and Leon's back-to-back
without a rest.

236
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,708
That's physically impossible.

237
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,458
And what are you going to
do in the last scene when

238
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,041
the two leads are
supposed to meet again?

239
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,125
Don't worry.

240
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,958
I know I can pull
this off somehow.

241
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,708
But Ken, I need
to ask you a favor.

242
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,416
That doesn't look
a thing like Leon.

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,958
What's going on?

244
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,208
I can do this.

245
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,333
I'm gonna pull this off,
no matter what!

246
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,041
Good! I can do it!

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,791
Layla entrusted
Kaleido Stage to me.

248
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,708
No matter what happens,
I've got to protect it!

249
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,875
In order to protect it,
we need Mr. Oswald.

250
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,000
No matter what kind
of person he is.

251
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,291
I'm not performing
for little kids.

252
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,041
Children are an important
part of our audience.

253
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,833
Just like when I was a
little girl and saw a show here

254
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,875
for the first time.

255
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,416
It was whimsical and fun.

256
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,666
I lost myself watching it.

257
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,958
That's what
Kaleido Stage is about.

258
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,083
Hurry!

259
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,625
Good luck.

260
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,666
Thanks.

261
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,958
What a quick change.

262
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,541
I can't show how tired I feel.

263
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,541
This has got to be
a lot. Even for her.

264
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,625
She must be reaching her limit.

265
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,958
I've never seen someone
as reckless as this one.

266
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,333
I've never seen anyone go
as far as she does, either.

267
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,916
Hmph.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,750
But I think someone like that
has a good chance of becoming

269
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,333
a shining star, don't you?

270
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,375
Oh no.

271
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,875
It's time for
the big fight scene.

272
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,583
Do you think she can do it?

273
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,708
To land on top of the
mountain while spinning

274
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,958
is already difficult, but...

275
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,583
Since she's been staggering
so much, she's got no choice

276
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,791
but to slow down the spins.

277
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,750
But if she does that, the
maneuver will be incomplete.

278
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,833
She's speeding up.

279
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,458
Impossible!

280
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:19,041
She's so awkward I can
hardly stand to watch her.

281
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:25,041
Even so, I've never seen
anyone quite like her before.

282
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,958
Sora Naegino.

283
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,833
This last part is the reunion
scene with the princess.

284
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,875
Go!

285
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,875
Go for it!

286
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,125
From this point on, the show's
going to change depending on

287
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,708
Sora's ideas out there.

288
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,416
I'll be giving you instructions.

289
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,791
I hear you loud and clear.

290
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,000
Ken, are you ready?

291
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,000
Ready.

292
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,916
Okay, lights out.

293
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,583
That's good. Now bring up
spotlight number five.

294
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,375
Wow, it's the princess!

295
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,583
You're right!

296
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,166
There she is!

297
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,583
All right, it's working!

298
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,041
Pretty!

299
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,375
Lights down.

300
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,750
Now bring up B.

301
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,583
Awesome.

302
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,416
Bring on Leon Oswald.

303
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,416
This is terrible.

304
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,291
This is awful.

305
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,125
Where is Leon Oswald?

306
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,708
Leon! Leon!

307
00:18:51,791 --> 00:19:01,750
Leon! Leon! Leon!
Leon! Leon! Leon!

308
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:07,416
Leon! Leon! Leon!
Leon! Leon! Leon!

309
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,750
You should learn
that the audience is

310
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,208
a performer's greatest enemy.

311
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,125
The performance
went well, but...

312
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,041
This doesn't sound good.

313
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,625
How pitiful, Sora Naegino.

314
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,458
Uh, excuse me?

315
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,125
I heard that Leon Oswald
absolutely refused to be

316
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,500
your partner anymore.

317
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,166
Isn't that why you're
performing for two?

318
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,958
What do you want me to do?

319
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,291
Uh, well, well, I-

320
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
Oh, I don't care.
Let them continue.

321
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,333
You're the boss, sir.

322
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,500
What?

323
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,791
She's a trapeze artist, too?

324
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:15,375
Eternal Angel Turn!

325
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,208
She's using the swing
so freely and easily.

326
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:26,791
The Dreamer's Spiral!

327
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:31,291
Amazing. She's so bold, she
performs with such confidence.

328
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,666
You see now? I'm the one

329
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,041
who's good enough
to be Leon Oswald's partner.

330
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,666
You, on the other hand,
aren't fit to shine his shoes,

331
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,791
Sora Naegino.

332
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,541
Who's that?

333
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,875
She was the applicant

334
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,083
with the highest score
in our audition this year.

335
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,958
What's going on?

336
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,583
Is this part of the show?

337
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,458
Where's my Leon?

338
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,541
Excuse me, who are you?

339
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,000
Who am I?

340
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:10,375
I am the next Layla Hamilton,
that's who I am.

341
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,250
I'm gonna kick you out

342
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,375
and be the biggest star
this place has ever seen.

343
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
From now on, you can't call
yourself a star around here

344
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,708
if you don't
have any talent.

345
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,416
You got that?

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,833
Hey look, it's Leon!

347
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,333
If either of them
could be my partner,

348
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,708
it might be worth
sticking around.

349
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,666
If only for a little bit longer.

350
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,666
Mr. Oswald?

351
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
I changed my mind.

352
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,916
I've decided to stay
here a little bit longer.

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,166
You're staying?

354
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,791
Then you'll appear
on stage with me?

355
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,125
He isn't staying for you.

356
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,708
He's staying for me.

357
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,625
Leon Oswald is truly great, and
he can see how talented I am.

358
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,166
Both of you, follow me
in an improvisation.

359
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,916
Let's go.

360
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,916
Right.

361
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,916
Wonder...

362
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,750
Arrow!

363
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,458
Well, what's going on?

364
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,708
They're fighting.

365
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,666
If I remember right,
that's May Wong,

366
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,916
the girl who gave
the best audition.

367
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,541
But why?

368
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,291
Layla entrusted
Kaleido Stage to me.

369
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,166
I've got to protect it!

370
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,250
I've got the talent to fill
the shoes of a Kaleido Star,

371
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,833
not you!

372
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,708
A new kind of Kaleido Stage
has been set in motion.

373
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,458
I'm not a little kid anymore.

374
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:06,541
Rosetta came and said she wanted
to be a part of Kaleido Stage,

375
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,666
but it seems that there's
a reason behind this.

376
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,208
Sora, please help me.

377
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,708
You're the only
one I can turn to.

378
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,541
Of course, I want to do
what I can for Rosetta, but...

379
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,500
All right, for my
beloved friend Rosetta,

380
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,500
I'm gonna do my
very best to help.

381
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,416
I will! I will! I will!

382
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,083
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'The Amazing Newcomer.'

383
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,916
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky!
