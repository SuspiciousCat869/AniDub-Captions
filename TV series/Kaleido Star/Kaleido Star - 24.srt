1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,666
We're about to raise the
curtain on Kaleido Star.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,041
As you watch the show, make
sure your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,541
and that you're not sitting
too close to the television.

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,750
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,125
Has anyone out there gotten
to the point where you say

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,125
to yourself, 'I just
can't do this anymore?'

7
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,916
You work so hard, but then you
hit your limit and it looks like

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,166
you'll never be able
to get what you want.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,833
But then a friend comes along
who really believes in you.

10
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,791
And encourages you to be better
than you thought you could be.

11
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,333
I'm so glad, so glad!

12
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm going down to the
river to do some laundry.

13
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,625
Okay.

14
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,750
Charlotte? Julie?

15
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:42,916
You guys are here too?

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Uh, yeah...

17
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,791
I haven't seen
you two in a while.

18
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,375
How come you're not
at Kaleido Stage?

19
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,791
Did you quit or something?

20
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,750
Let's just say we had a little
disagreement with Yuri.

21
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,208
And when he overheard
that he fired us.

22
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,000
Shhh!

23
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:55,708
How's Sora?

24
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,875
Working hard, as usual?

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,000
'Working hard' is
a huge understatement.

26
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,458
Yeah, she looks awful.

27
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,875
Her training regimen's
extremely severe.

28
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,958
If I had to work
as hard as that I'd die!

29
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,166
I just don't know
how she can endure it.

30
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,333
I've got a lot of
respect for her.

31
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,333
What has Sora gotten
herself into this time?

32
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,000
'The Amazing Intensive
Training Continues.'

33
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,083
Yes, we're very excited about
their attempt so we've planned

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,291
countdown events
leading up to the show.

35
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,375
I want Layla and Sora
to have a packed house.

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,833
Well, you're
creating quite a buzz,

37
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,375
so I don't think
you have to worry.

38
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,708
But why the decision to make
tickets nonrefundable even if

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,333
they can't complete the
Legendary Great Maneuver?

40
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,833
Well, as you know, a few
months ago when Kaleido Stage

41
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,500
changed hands we had to cancel a
few performances of 'Freedom.'

42
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,666
That created some
financial strain.

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,666
I don't mean to
malign my predecessor,

44
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,125
but Kaleido Stage was
in a state of disarray.

45
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,750
From my perspective, I think
it's only fair that people know

46
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,791
what they're getting into
when they purchase a ticket,

47
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,625
especially considering how
difficult this trick is.

48
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,250
And how have your
ticket buyers reacted?

49
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,166
Not a single complaint.

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,833
There is a rumor that your
father was part of the last

51
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,041
Kaleido Stage team to attempt
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,708
That's right. And my
father never succeeded with

53
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,250
the maneuver, he died
during a rehearsal.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,916
So this is an extremely
dangerous stunt?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,083
Yes, it's going to be very
difficult, and that's why

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,958
we want to give Layla
and Sora so much support.

57
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,291
Best of luck to them.

58
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,833
We'll be showing a live
broadcast of their attempt

59
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,000
of the Legendary Great
Maneuver next month.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,208
So are they going to be able to
pull this thing off or what?

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,625
That's pretty doubtful.

62
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,041
I'm about 99% sure we'll
have to cancel this show.

63
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,541
That show sold out within
minutes of our announcement.

64
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,041
And now all the countdown
shows are selling out, too.

65
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,291
It seems like people really
want to see this thing.

66
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,500
Who knew they'd
care so much about

67
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,250
the Legendary Great Maneuver?

68
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,083
I know it's a huge draw so I've
got a plan to keep our momentum

69
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,750
going after the cancellation.

70
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,916
Layla and I are going to
announce our attempt at--

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,750
That won't be necessary.

72
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,166
Once you cancel we can
end Kaleido Stage.

73
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,625
It'll be the perfect chance
for us to sell it off.

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,583
Sell it?

75
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,000
You didn't think we'd just stand
by while you ran this place

76
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,500
into the ground, did you?

77
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,458
That old coot Kenneth saw
this coming from a mile away.

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,541
I should've
bailed out when he did.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,708
Again!

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,416
Sora!

81
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,583
Oh Mia, Anna. I didn't
know you were coming.

82
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,666
How's Jonathan and
everyone in Cape Mary?

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,916
You don't need to
make small talk with us.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,250
What's going on here?

85
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,750
This is my special training.

86
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,958
Special training? What?

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,958
Ken, how could you
do this to Sora?

88
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,416
Come on, stand up.
You've got to keep working

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
if you want to
catch up with Layla.

90
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,208
Yes. You're right.

91
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:58,791
But Sora...

92
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,083
This is foolish.

93
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,500
I know, and being foolish
is my my specialty--

94
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:05,666
Sora!

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,750
Sora!

96
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,625
Ken, you can't work her
any more today.

97
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,916
We're taking her to the lodge.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

99
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,500
I understand she's gotta train,

100
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,833
but for her to be so
bruised-- it's ridiculous.

101
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,958
I can't believe Ken? I thought
he'd at least try to protect

102
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,791
her from this kind of thing.

103
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,958
Oh no!

104
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,833
I overslept. I've got to train!

105
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,291
Where are you going?

106
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,625
You can train, but
you need to rest first!

107
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,125
Calm down, Sora!

108
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,041
If you don't take a break,
you're going to kill yourself.

109
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,625
You're working too hard.

110
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,875
I appreciate your concern, but
I'm fine now and I've got to go.

111
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,000
Layla's training is already
more intense than mine,

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,833
and I don't wanna
be left behind.

113
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,625
Sora!

114
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,750
Even Layla looks like

115
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,041
she's being beaten
down by this training.

116
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,125
The Legendary Great Maneuver...

117
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,250
I knew it would be difficult,
but I never would've guessed

118
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,625
in a hundred years
that it'd be like this.

119
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,083
Do you think we should
tell her what we found out?

120
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,541
Hmm.

121
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,041
'Cause I kind of think she'd
be better off not knowing.

122
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,708
You could be right...

123
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,583
You did it!

124
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,333
I did it...

125
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,958
That's useless if you can't
repeat it. We'll be out here

126
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,750
until you can do it
ten times in a row.

127
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,083
All right.

128
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,041
Are you ready?

129
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,416
Yes!

130
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,083
I think I'm beginning
to understand just what

131
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,416
the Legendary Great
Maneuver entails.

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,708
It would be incredible if I
could do it but as long as

133
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,416
there's such a gulf
between me and Sora,

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,625
I know it'll never work.

135
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,583
Layla, you can't be finished
with dinner already.

136
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,916
Yes. I'm afraid I don't
have much of an appetite.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,708
Starting tomorrow, I'd like
to eat meals in my room.

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,791
Uh... sure.

139
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,208
I wonder...

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,291
That's ten!

141
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, now we can move on
to the next training level.

142
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's get started.

143
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,125
I want to earn
the kind of applause

144
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,166
that makes my
whole body tremble!

145
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,791
I have been doing
a lot of thinking.

146
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,916
Sora I know we can do this.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,791
No matter what happens, we've
got to be at that performance...

148
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,125
Right!

149
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,000
Just keeping my body
rigid is going to be hard,

150
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,875
and that's only the half of it.

151
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,166
Swinging that high is...

152
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,000
Are you gonna work or what?

153
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,375
Yes, sir!

154
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,166
I don't know, Layla seems
a little irritated to me.

155
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,208
I wonder if that's why

156
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,583
she doesn't want
to eat at the table.

157
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,000
It could be,

158
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,541
but maybe she just doesn't
like Charlotte's cooking.

159
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,208
Take that back! Right now!

160
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,125
No, I don't think that's it.

161
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,166
Yeah, your food's
actually pretty good.

162
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,625
Thank you, Anna. It's nice
that someone appreciates me...

163
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:44,958
Maybe Layla's upset because she
thinks I'm not good enough.

164
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,000
I wonder... I wonder if
I have what it takes to be

165
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,000
her partner after all.

166
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,375
Her stability has improved
a lot over the last week.

167
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,500
But it's like she's lost
her motivation somehow...

168
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,958
I can't watch anymore.

169
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,541
You wanna go give
Charlotte and Julie a hand?

170
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,625
Layla, wait. Tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

171
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,375
Tell me to work harder,
be stronger.

172
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,750
How I can be a better partner.

173
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,791
Or tell me I'll never be good
enough to work with you anyway.

174
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,916
Just please say something.
Please talk to me, Layla!

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Tell me what I've done
that's so terrible!

176
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,333
Sora... I'm sorry,
I have nothing to say.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,875
Mr. Kenneth?
What's he doing here?

178
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,333
I hope nothing's wrong.

179
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,083
Uh, to bring you
all the way out here...

180
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,333
Your face looks like

181
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,416
you've aged thirty years
in just ten days, Sora.

182
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,458
What became of that competitive
spirit? Your eyes are empty now.

183
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,000
You don't look like
someone capable of doing

184
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,166
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

185
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,416
Sora's just exhausted because
she's been training all d--

186
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,833
Looks like all this is going to
turn out just like they wanted.

187
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,458
What are you talking about?

188
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,500
All those maggots who've
still got their money

189
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,000
in Kaleido Stage, that's what.

190
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,166
They don't believe
you can do it.

191
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,583
And, as a matter of fact,
they're hoping you'll fail.

192
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,666
Whether you can perfect
the maneuver or not,

193
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
they'll still get their money.

194
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,208
And, after all, that's
really all they care about.

195
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,166
But that's...

196
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,666
Actually, they'd be happiest

197
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,416
of all if the show
was canceled altogether.

198
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,083
That way, they
don't have to worry

199
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,500
about the show-day expenses.

200
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,000
But what about the audience?

201
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,875
What about them? Can you
even tell me with certainty

202
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,708
you won't disappoint them?

203
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,166
That you and Layla will
succeed at this thing?

204
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,125
Can you look me in the eye and
say 'I'm not going to fail?'

205
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,041
I...

206
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,375
Can you even say you deserve

207
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,583
to be a partner to
the great Layla Hamilton?

208
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,166
Tell me to work
harder, be stronger.

209
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,500
How I can be a better partner.

210
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,000
Or tell me I'll never be good
enough to work with you anyway.

211
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:14,083
Just please say something.
Please talk to me, Layla!

212
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,500
Tell me what I've
done that's so terrible!

213
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm sorry, I have
nothing to say.

214
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,375
I...

215
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,541
Sora!

216
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,916
I don't know what your angle is,

217
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,375
saying something
like that to her,

218
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,916
but she's having
a tough enough time trying

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,708
to keep her spirits up without
you knocking her down.

220
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,458
It's nice out here. I think
I'll stay a little while.

221
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,458
Wha--? Stay here?

222
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,833
Make me a coffee,
will you, Chauncey?

223
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,625
That's not my name.
It's Ken Robbins.

224
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,958
Sora?

225
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,333
Why couldn't I say it?

226
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,291
Why couldn't I just
tell him I can do this?

227
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,916
That I have it in me?

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,125
I guess I let it go to my head,
being partners with Layla,

229
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,791
and now I'm finding out
that I just don't...

230
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,375
I just don't have what
it takes to be on stage

231
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,125
with her after all.

232
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,500
And when Mr. Kenneth said
that all I could think to do

233
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:33,916
was run away, I--
I couldn't answer him.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,375
You can't beat yourself up
about that, Sora.

235
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,916
But you know,

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,791
if you want to quit none of us
will think any less of you.

237
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:44,583
I'm sure Layla would understand
if you explained it to her.

238
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,125
No, she wouldn't. You should
have heard what she said to me:

239
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,333
Doubting yourself
is just a waste of time.

240
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,541
Either do this or don't try.

241
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,416
But it might be the best thing
for Layla if I let her choose

242
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,208
a more talented partner...

243
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,333
It's very kind of you to come
all this way just to see us.

244
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:05,250
Yep. But I was mostly interested
in seeing Sora's progress,

245
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,125
since she's such
a talented girl.

246
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,125
I never would've dreamed
she'd be good enough to attempt

247
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,500
the Legendary Great
Maneuver, though.

248
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,000
I wouldn't have, either.

249
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,583
They're the first
since Arlon Brass, huh?

250
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right.

251
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,458
You're still blaming yourself
for Arlon's stupidity,

252
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,583
aren't you?

253
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,958
I was partly
responsible after all.

254
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,291
Well. Arlon Brass
was a good man,

255
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,583
but he had no business
attempting that maneuver.

256
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,166
And, as I recall,
you told him so several times.

257
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,500
What?

258
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,666
It's true, Arlon Brass
was one of the last people

259
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,541
to attempt the maneuver
at Kaleido Stage.

260
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,208
If his name sounds familiar
it's because he was a top star

261
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,208
at the time, and he's
also Yuri's father.

262
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,458
And Jean confirmed what
Mia heard, so it's all true.

263
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,958
Yuri must have told his
investors exactly what happened

264
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,541
last time so naturally
they don't believe

265
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,375
the Legendary Great
Maneuver can be done.

266
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,875
It has nothing
to do with you, Sora.

267
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,666
I see.

268
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,041
It's a deal. So you've
got exactly one month

269
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,958
to perfect this
Legendary Great Maneuver.

270
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,750
He only made that bet because he
thought we'd never be able to do

271
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,708
the Legendary Great Maneuver and
win Kaleido Stage back from him.

272
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,875
Seems to me your biggest
problem's is not Sora's

273
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,250
physical capabilities. The
great challenge is getting Sora

274
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,916
to believe in herself.

275
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,291
Well, if she doesn't believe
in herself at least that means

276
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,333
she won't be foolish enough
to try the maneuver anyway.

277
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
I suppose you have
a point there.

278
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,708
Still, I don't think we should
sell these young people short.

279
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,000
They come up with amazing
things when their backs

280
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:34,958
are to the wall.

281
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,416
My money's on Sora.

282
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,958
Is that why you took your
money out of Kaleido Stage:

283
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,833
you like the thrill
of the unknown?

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, I guess that's part of it.

285
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:46,166
I just couldn't stand doing
business with those maggots.

286
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,625
I'm taking Layla
her tray, all right?

287
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,958
Fine.

288
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,791
Sora's not coming; she doesn't
have much of an appetite.

289
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,625
We should probably leave her be.

290
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,000
Right.

291
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,333
Yes?

292
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,291
What is it?

293
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,708
Well, it's just that...
Layla told me not to say

294
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,208
anything about this, but I
thought that you should know.

295
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,666
Layla? I need to talk
to you. Can I come in?

296
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:44,875
Ken.

297
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,958
Layla isn't in her room right
now. She went out for a run.

298
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,666
She's gone running?
But it's not light yet.

299
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,583
Layla's trying
to lose some weight.

300
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,000
But why?

301
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:01,041
Because when you perform the
Legendary Great Maneuver

302
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,208
you have a much higher
chance of success

303
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,958
if both partners
weigh roughly the same.

304
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,500
I guess Layla looked at
the training and figured out

305
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,625
what kind of trick
this is gonna be.

306
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,791
She should probably
be back any time now.

307
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,500
You know how Layla's been eating
all of her meals in her room

308
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,583
for the past few days?

309
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,375
Well, it turns out she's not
eating much of anything.

310
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,500
What?

311
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,333
Charlotte told me
about it last night.

312
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,125
I guess Layla wanted her
to keep it a secret.

313
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,375
But that's so dangerous. And
she's doing this because of me?

314
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,583
Well, Sora, you're trying to
be a better partner for Layla.

315
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,416
It's only fair she should try
to be a better partner for you.

316
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,958
You need to stop believing

317
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,083
that all the problems in this
partnership are your fault.

318
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,916
I mean, aren't the two of
you supposed to be equal?

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,958
So Layla is...

320
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,000
I idolized her
for such a long time.

321
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,083
It's true, you have
something I don't possess.

322
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,375
This has to be a real fight
between the two of us.

323
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,083
When I was a little
girl I came to see

324
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,916
one of their shows
with my parents.

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,125
It was wonderful, just
like a beautiful dream.

326
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,583
Don't think that means I'll
never be able to perform again.

327
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,500
This isn't my last show
unless I choose for it to be.

328
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
I've never, not once
in all these years,

329
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,458
had a partner that's
motivated me this much.

330
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,958
Layla...

331
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,791
I always thought the two of
you were perfectly matched.

332
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,416
Thanks for saying that Ken.

333
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,291
Layla!

334
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,458
Sora?

335
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,583
I'm so sorry. I wanted to run
away because training's so hard.

336
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,791
I told myself I didn't have

337
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,041
what it takes to be
your partner, anyway.

338
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,708
But I'm not gonna
doubt myself anymore,

339
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,666
and I'm gonna work extra
hard to catch up with you

340
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,791
so we can perfect the maneuver
and get Kaleido Stage back.

341
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,625
And I promise, Layla,
I won't doubt myself again.

342
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,666
I'll work twice as hard. I'll
be the partner you deserve--

343
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,666
the partner you're
trying to be for me.

344
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,541
No matter what it takes,
I'm not going to let you down.

345
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,375
We're going to do the
Legendary Great Maneuver!

346
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,666
I've never doubted for a moment
that you and I would be able

347
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,750
to do this thing.

348
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,833
Right.

349
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,333
But I don't want you to lose any
more weight for this, all right?

350
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,833
I'll eat more, I'll gain weight,
I'll get stronger, anything.

351
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,333
Sounds good to me.

352
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,000
That's the girl we've
been waiting to see.

353
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,916
Then I'm glad you came out, sir.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I knew this would be worth
every second of the drive.

355
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,500
I tell you, she must be tough

356
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,291
to claw her way out
of such despair.

357
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,166
You mean you
planned all this? But--

358
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,416
Well, now that I'm awake,

359
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,416
I could use a nice
stiff bourbon, young boy.

360
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,375
My name is Ken Robbins.

361
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,375
And from now on I think
I'd like it if we didn't

362
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,958
keep secrets from each other.

363
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:13,916
Good idea.

364
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
Then it's settled.

365
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,291
Not yet. You're still not
qualified to know about

366
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,041
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

367
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,958
The inverted Empress. It seems
that fate has even more ordeals

368
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,041
in store for the two of you.

369
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,958
If you overcome this adversity,

370
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,166
there's no way
that you can fail.

371
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,750
But your success may come
at the greatest price of all.

372
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,375
Only time will tell...

373
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,291
What happened?

374
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,666
Did you hurt yourself?

375
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,916
It's nothing, I'm fine.

376
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I thought I just saw
you hit your shoulder.

377
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,291
I just wasn't concentrating
and scratched it a little bit.

378
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,750
It's all right.

379
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,958
I think you should go get it
checked out, just in case.

380
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,208
We don't have time for that,

381
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,208
Sora. Come on.
Let's get back to work.

382
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,708
Right.

383
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,666
I guess it's no big deal.
She's doing fine.

384
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,958
Losing that weight
took it out of me.

385
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,458
I passed out for a second.

386
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,458
This injury's not going
to ruin our chances.

387
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,416
I just need it to
last a little longer.

388
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,333
She's crying!

389
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,916
It's the day before
our performance,

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,041
and Layla's injuries are worse
than even she could've imagined.

391
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,291
But even in the face of that,
she's still determined to go on.

392
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,666
Why has she kept this
from us for so long?

393
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,083
And why does she push herself
so hard? Why? Why? Why?

394
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,583
Make sure not to miss our next
episode, 'An Amazing Bond.'

395
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,250
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
