00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,416
Hello, everybody,
Kaleido Star is about to begin,

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,791
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,125
and you're not sitting
too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:29,875
Well, well, well,

5
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,125
Is there anybody
you've got a crush on?

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,500
You know, someone that
makes your heart all achy

7
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,416
and that you want
to hold hands with?

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,625
Oh, someday I want to fall
in love with someone, too!

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,208
It's going to be so nice!
I can't wait, I can't wait,

10
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,875
I can't-- huh? Ken,
what are you crying for?

11
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,166
Time to get up, sleepyhead!

12
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,208
'The Diva's Amazing Love.'

13
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,625
Don't think that you can lie
in bed all day just because

14
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,458
you're on holiday.

15
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,958
But I haven't had a chance
to sleep in since I got back

16
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,833
from Theatrical Camp.

17
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,500
You met Pamela there,
didn't you? How is she doing?

18
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,958
She's fine. And she showed me
the most amazing trapeze trick!

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,291
Oh, yes, I remember that
trick. She was rarely able

20
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,791
to do it successfully,
so we never let her put it

21
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,625
in a performance.

22
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,666
Oh...

23
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,000
I guess it would be hard
to do it every show. I mean,

24
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,708
I saw it with my own eyes
and it was incredible--

25
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,708
it was like I was watching a
miracle. It gave me goose bumps.

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,458
I mean to jump straight up
from your swing and go so high,

27
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,458
then come back down and catch
the swing you just jumped from.

28
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,000
It was unbelievable.

29
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,541
Kaleido Stage just wasn't the
right place for her talents.

30
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,958
There. That's the last one.
Thanks for your help, Sora.

31
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,791
Being Dorm Supervisor's
a tough job, isn't it?

32
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,250
That's right.
Don't you forget it.

33
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,791
Sarah Dupont!

34
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,125
What's going on?

35
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,375
I think they're
looking for you.

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,833
Run, Sora, run!

37
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,000
Where are you going?

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,708
What did you do?
Why are they after you?

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,875
Are-- are you okay?

40
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,375
I can't run any more.

41
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,375
Please get out of here, Sora,
before they find you, too.

42
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,500
Sarah, why are they
chasing you? AAH!

43
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:30,875
Sarah. My eternal diva I want
to take you away from all this.

44
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,375
Andy?

45
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,333
Tell me, Miss Dupont is
it true you're going to be

46
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,833
leaving Kaleido Stage
to become an artist at ADX,

47
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,541
Andy Lowe's
mega-hot record label?

48
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,041
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

49
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,250
Yes, it is.

50
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,500
Andy?!

51
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,333
What? What?!

52
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:53,333
What are you saying? I've
never considered leaving here.

53
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,875
Kalos is letting you go, Sarah.

54
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,583
So, Andy, are you
and Sarah an item now?

55
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,000
A gentleman never tells.

56
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
Can you at least pose for us? 

57
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,166
As long as you
make sure we look good.

58
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,708
Ouch! I think we've answered
enough questions today.

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,333
If there's anything else you'd
like to know about, ask Sora.

60
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,291
Uh but I don't know!

61
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,958
Go home!

62
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,625
I mean, I don't think
I can help you.

63
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,833
What was that about?

64
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,291
They said she was leaving to
record for some record label.

65
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,458
I hope that she's not
leaving Kaleido Stage.

66
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,833
What? Is Sarah crying?

67
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,166
Oh no...

68
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,666
It's open...

69
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,583
Um, Sarah?

70
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,791
Sora?

71
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,541
Is it okay if I come in?

72
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,916
Of course. I'm so
sorry about earlier.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,583
I didn't mind so much--
it was kind of exciting.

74
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,083
Then the next time a mob of
reporters comes to my door

75
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,166
I'm going to turn
them loose on you.

76
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
What's the picture of?

77
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,375
Me. Ten years ago.

78
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,875
Who are those other people?

79
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:46,333
Oh. That's Andy on the right
and Kalos on the left.

80
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,666
You look really happy with
your friends Andy and Kalos--

81
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,333
Kalos?!

82
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,708
You've got good,
tight leg muscles!

83
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,458
You're in the company.

84
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,583
You won't be playing a role.

85
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,208
How come he looks so -- so nice?

86
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,833
It's funny, back then we didn't
have any money to our names,

87
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,958
but we were following our
dreams so we were happy.

88
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,916
Andy wrote music, I sang,

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,583
and Kalos wowed the
crowds with magic tricks.

90
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,791
He was more popular than
Andy and I put together.

91
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:31,416
He even had his own show in Las
Vegas for a while. But then...

92
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,083
He got injured.
His fingers, you see?

93
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,083
But didn't they
ever get better?

94
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,416
Not enough to ever
perform magic again.

95
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,083
But Kalos was all right.
He had insured his fingers.

96
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,125
He took the money from
his settlement and started

97
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,041
Kaleido Stage with it.

98
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,125
Owning a circus had
always been a dream of his,

99
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,916
and it took every penny he had.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,125
All of it...?

101
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,958
Well, he doesn't
do anything halfway.

102
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,166
So I decided to follow Kalos.

103
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,416
He told me not to come.

104
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,375
But it was so obvious that
he really wanted me here.

105
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,916
But I don't understand:

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,791
if you really wanted
to become a singer, then...

107
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,791
Then what?

108
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,375
Why'd you join
the Boss's circus?

109
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
Well, I was in love.

110
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:26,291
Really?! Love... with the Boss?!

111
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,958
You're in the company.

112
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,458
I want you to do it.
If you don't like it, leave!

113
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,250
That's so...

114
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,916
I don't know why I said 'was.'
I still am in love.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,750
You mean right now?!
That's so weird...

116
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,625
Well I suppose it would
seem a bit strange to you.

117
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,208
But I've never I've never
tried to hide how I feel

118
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,125
about Kalos from anyone.

119
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,708
So, are you saying that you

120
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,083
gave up on your dream just so
you could be close to the Boss?

121
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,375
What? No. I don't think that
I gave up my dream at all.

122
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,166
It simply changed a bit.

123
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,583
In those days I wanted world
tours and platinum albums

124
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,125
and people everywhere listening
to my songs on the radio.

125
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,083
But I really enjoy singing
here. There's no place that

126
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,208
I'd rather be. And I
feel like I'm needed here.

127
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,750
And that that feeling of being
wanted and needed isn't just

128
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,791
something that happens
everywhere you go, Sora...

129
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,541
But... I guess
that's all over now.

130
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,250
Ten long years...

131
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,791
I knew it. Sarah was crying
when I saw her earlier.

132
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,375
Unless he stops her,

133
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,458
she's going to leave us to join
Andy's record label for sure.

134
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:50,208
There he is. I need to talk
to you, Boss. Right now.

135
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,791
It's really important--

136
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:57,791
Hey, wait!
I need to talk to you!

137
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,625
He's ignoring me!

138
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,375
I thought someone was
being murdered. What's up?

139
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:20,208
Hey, did you see which way
the Boss's car went?

140
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,833
Girl, don't tell me you thought
you could outrun that man's car.

141
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,541
Huh, is that right?
Sarah's in love with Kalos...

142
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,166
Guess you never can tell what's
going on in folks' hearts.

143
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,083
You've got that right. I don't
get it: Sarah's facing the

144
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:40,041
biggest decision of her life and
he just leaves. Hey! His car!

145
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,250
What is that place?

146
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,791
Only the fanciest
restaurant in the city.

147
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,541
What?

148
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,416
Should we follow him?

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,625
Of course!

150
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,875
I can't believe he's going out
for lunch at a time like this.

151
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,125
Did you see where he's sitting?

152
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,291
Right over there.

153
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,500
Let's try to get closer.

154
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,125
Roger that.

155
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,875
You haven't changed. Ten years
ago, the only thing you really

156
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,083
cared about was perfecting
that magic act of yours.

157
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,875
And now the only thing you
care about is Kaleido Stage.

158
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,041
I feel sorry for Sarah.

159
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,416
I just want to be positive

160
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,375
that you're ready
to let her go, Kalos.

161
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,916
Yeah, I don't need her anymore.

162
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,916
He doesn't need Sarah?

163
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,375
You know, back then I never
stood a chance against you

164
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,416
with Sarah. I didn't
have anything to offer.

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
But now I'm the one
who's in the position

166
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,375
to make all
her dreams come true.

167
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,583
And I will. Because,
unlike you, Kalos,

168
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,166
I truly love Sarah
with all my heart.

169
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,625
I'd like to make a toast
to our future together.

170
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,958
A toast?!

171
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,666
Fine.

172
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,916
--Wait!
--Nooooo!

173
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Sora?

174
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,416
You know her?

175
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,916
She's in the company.
What are you doing?

176
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,666
No, what are you doing,
deciding what's best for Sarah

177
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,166
without even bothering
to ask her what she wants.

178
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,916
This is none of
your business. Now go.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,708
No. Not until you listen
to what I have to say.

180
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,750
Get out!

181
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,083
No way! Not until
you hear me out!

182
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm warning you!

183
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,708
Just listen to me,
Boss, Sarah told me --

184
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,916
Stubborn as mules,
both of them...

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,125
I have to tell you
what she told me,

186
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,708
all right?!

187
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,375
Okay, stop shouting and we'll
listen. Is that a deal, Kalos?

188
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,708
Yeah, thank you very much.

189
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,583
Boss, Sarah loves
performing at Kaleido Stage.

190
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,625
She's not interested
in working anyplace else.

191
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,708
You know it wasn't true when you
said you didn't need her here.

192
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,833
What good would it do me
to lie about that?

193
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,750
Sarah's dead weight around here.

194
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,000
That's an awful thing to say.

195
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:04,208
Well, the truth hurts sometimes.
Now will you get out of here?

196
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,958
But you you needed Sarah
ten years ago when you were

197
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:12,041
trying to start
Kaleido Stage. So how...

198
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,208
Look, I never told her that
I needed her. If she chose to

199
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:19,333
believe that's why she was
here that's not my fault.

200
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,666
You mean to tell me that
you've just been using her all

201
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,416
this time? That's despicable.

202
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,125
You think so?

203
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,875
I guess I knew that you
could be a little difficult

204
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,500
and that sometimes you
could seem kind of rude.

205
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,166
But Kaleido Stage brings such
joy to people that I thought

206
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,750
for sure you had
to have a good heart.

207
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,916
I guess I couldn't have
been more wrong about that.

208
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,041
Excuse me, but I've
got a business to run.

209
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,500
I'll pick Sarah up later today.

210
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,958
Okay.

211
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,625
Okay?! How could you turn
your back on her like this?

212
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,666
How could you?

213
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,541
Sarah?

214
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,500
Come in.

215
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,041
I was just--

216
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,625
Sorry, it's a bit of a mess.

217
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:18,916
What are you doing?

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,125
Andy called to say

219
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,208
he'd be picking me up
later this evening.

220
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:26,833
It looks as if I'm going to be
the next ADX Records superstar!

221
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,625
I wish I could've thrown
a big going away party, but...

222
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,166
Well, I guess
it can't be helped...

223
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,333
So, are you all right
with this? With leaving?

224
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,208
I'm not sure yet. Everything
has happened so quickly

225
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,125
I don't know what to think.

226
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:44,291
I do know that I've been
with Kalos for over ten years

227
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,833
and in all this time
he's never lied to me once.

228
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:52,708
So this morning when he told me
that he doesn't need me here...

229
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:57,666
I was shocked
but it must be true.

230
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,458
But we do need you.

231
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,583
When you send me off today,
be cheerful, all right?

232
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,791
I couldn't take anything gloomy.

233
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,125
Look at me standing around
while there's work to be done.

234
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,041
The moving company will
take care of the big stuff,

235
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,208
but I still haven't
finished packing my clothes.

236
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, and I'm going to need the
nunchucks and broadsword, too...

237
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,500
They've already got
an artist's profile up for her

238
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,333
on the ADX web site.

239
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,458
That was fast.

240
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,750
How are we gonna
keep her from going?

241
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,583
I don't know, if someone
I loved said he didn't need me,

242
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,875
I wouldn't want to stay.

243
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,250
You've got a point.

244
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
And I heard that tons
of record companies

245
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,333
have tried to sign her,

246
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,000
but this is the first time
she's agreed to it.

247
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,875
And the Boss
never said anything?

248
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,291
How come he's deciding
to let her go now?

249
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,166
You're right, it doesn't make
sense that he's changed his mind

250
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,625
about Sarah.

251
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,125
Is it because

252
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,375
she doesn't bring the
audiences in like Layla does?

253
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,958
Actually, a lot of people
come just to see her.

254
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,958
Kalos is gonna take a hit when
people find out she's gone.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,666
It's a classic love triangle.
Those three are so wrapped up

256
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,625
in each other that they don't
know which end's up anymore.

257
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,125
How exciting!

258
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,583
Two friends have been fighting
over Sarah for ten years!

259
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,750
But Sarah's only
loved Kalos all along!

260
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,916
Now Andy's ready
to take her back for good.

261
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,666
What could've possibly made
Kalos stop fighting for her?

262
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,166
Could it be the pretty new girl

263
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,750
Sora who's caught
the Boss's eye?

264
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,958
Join us next time for
'Sarah's Troubled Love!'

265
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,833
Uh, I don't think so.

266
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,583
Well why else would

267
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,291
the Boss decide to let her
go after all this time?

268
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,958
Well, maybe he just realized

269
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,958
that he doesn't
love her anymore.

270
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,708
We've got to do something,
guys. To stop this.

271
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,541
There it is, ladies
and gents. Sora's specialty.

272
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,000
So what do you
think we should do?

273
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, what can we do?

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
Hmm. Let me think...

275
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,000
The Fool.

276
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,458
Well, what a handsome card.

277
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,666
But seriously, it means that
as long as you stay flexible,

278
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,333
anything is possible, so don't--

279
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,041
Huh?

280
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,041
That's it!

281
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,625
Oh, yeah! Thanks for helping me,
Fool! This is gonna be perfect,

282
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,791
I just know it!

283
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,250
So, shall we?

284
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,250
Sure.

285
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,541
Sarah?

286
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,791
It looks like you two

287
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,541
are the only ones who came
to send me off. Where's Sora?

288
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,250
She wanted us to pass
a message on to you.

289
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,000
She said if you want to know how
the Boss really feels about you,

290
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,166
come to the stage.

291
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,083
I'm afraid I already know...

292
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,416
I think I'd like
to see that, Sarah.

293
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,708
Andy...

294
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,958
Sora, what are you doing?

295
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,833
I am a mystical seer,
the Magical Rabbit!

296
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,833
And I'll use my
psychic powers to find out

297
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,375
how you're really feeling.

298
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,416
This isn't in
my job description.

299
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,291
Quick. Go find anything on
how Kalos feels about Sarah.

300
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,666
Okay, I'm going.

301
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,916
Get out of my office. Right now.

302
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,208
I can't. Not until you
start telling me the truth.

303
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,375
What am I lying about? I really
want you out of my office--

304
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,791
Have you lost your mind?!

305
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
I'm not going anywhere, boss,

306
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,958
until you say how
you feel about Sarah.

307
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,625
That's none of your business.

308
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
You still haven't
answered my question!

309
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,625
It seems strange that
I'll never sing here again...

310
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,708
Come clean: I know
what's on your mind.

311
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,000
You want to say,
'Sarah, don't go!'

312
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,166
Stop this!

313
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,041
'I don't know what
I'll do without you.'

314
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:40,708
Sora!

315
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,750
'I love you, Sarah!'

316
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,166
'Please don't stop singing
for Kaleido Stage, Sarah!'

317
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,708
I don't feel
anything for her, okay?!

318
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,708
Okay.

319
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,541
We're ready.

320
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,250
It's time, Jonathan.

321
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If that's the case, you won't
mind answering a question.

322
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,416
What?

323
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,833
How come you have that
picture sitting on your desk?!

324
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,541
What?

325
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,583
But-- how did that...?

326
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,041
Never underestimate the
powers of the Magical Rabbit.

327
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,125
If you don't care
about Sarah anymore,

328
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,958
then why do you keep
her picture on display?

329
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:25,500
Sora what I'm about to say is
never going to leave this room.

330
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,750
It's true that ten years ago--
no, no even after that--

331
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,208
I needed to keep Sarah close.

332
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,125
Her songs brought
something to Kaleido Stage

333
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,916
that no one else could.
And she meant so much to me.

334
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,875
In the beginning, there
were times that I thought

335
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,416
I would fail, but she
always stayed by me.

336
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,708
In time it became hard for me
to imagine my life without her.

337
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,541
I didn't know how I'd survive.

338
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,041
You may think this
sounds conceited but I knew

339
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,375
she'd never leave me.

340
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:01,291
The only way she'd be free
to pursue her own dream

341
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,666
was if I let her go.

342
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,166
Oh, Kalos you can
be so impossible.

343
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,625
But I was too selfish, too much
of a coward to let her leave.

344
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,000
I couldn't imagine losing her,
so for ten years I've been

345
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,708
standing in the way
of her happiness.

346
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,583
I just couldn't live
with that anymore.

347
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,541
Then Andy came to me
and made his offer.

348
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,041
He can do things
for Sarah I never could.

349
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:31,041
Of course I still need her,
Sora, I'll always need her.

350
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,083
But I couldn't live with
myself if I didn't let her go.

351
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:41,166
Such a fool...
Andy, I'm so sorry...

352
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,125
I understand.
I can't compete with Kalos.

353
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,916
Call me if you ever get
tired of his little games.

354
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,500
If you really care about Sarah,

355
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,375
you won't breathe a word of
this to anyone. Understood?

356
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,250
Uh, too late.

357
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,208
What?

358
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,875
That's right.

359
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,083
I heard every word.

360
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,166
But how? A microphone?

361
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,375
I'll be leaving
you two alone now.

362
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,125
Hey!

363
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,291
Kalos, how could you try to make
a decision like that for me?

364
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,375
This is your chance
to really become a singer.

365
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:27,166
And what have I been doing
here for the past ten years?

366
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,916
You've got to let me
decide these things for myself,

367
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,875
and right now I'm
happy at Kaleido Stage.

368
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,041
I've always been happy here.

369
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,708
Every time a new cast comes in
it's like a brand-new adventure.

370
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,875
Besides all that
you're here, Kalos.

371
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,916
Are we ready, girls? It's the
first show after the holiday,

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,375
so let's give it everything
we've got, all right?

373
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,583
Right!

374
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,916
It's showtime.

375
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,916
I came here to see what a
horrible failure you've become.

376
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,833
A classmate of mine from junior
high dropped in for a visit,

377
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,583
but I'm not exactly sure why.

378
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,125
And that's not the only strange
thing: at the same time...

379
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,958
Sora, please come with me.

380
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,250
What?! Where does
Yuri want me to go?!

381
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,166
And what's
going on with Minami?

382
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,833
This is all too weird.
Freaky, freaky, freaky!

383
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:02,208
Join us next time for
'An Amazing Sinister Rumor.'

384
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,916
My wings are my dreams
and on towards the sky...
