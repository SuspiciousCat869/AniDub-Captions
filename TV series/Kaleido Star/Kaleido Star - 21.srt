1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey there! Kaleido Star
is about to start.

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,625
So please make sure that your
room is brightly lit and that

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,500
you're not sitting
too close to the TV, okay?

4
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,125
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,083
Do you guys like
amusement parks?

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,708
Funnel cakes and roller
coasters everywhere!

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,833
It's such an
exciting place to be,

8
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,458
and I'm glad it looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,500
But since we're not on
a traditional stage,

10
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,291
our show's a lot harder to do.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,541
That means we always

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,375
have to give the show
everything we've got.

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,125
Always, always!

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,166
But who could...
who could that be?

15
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,666
Amazing. She was only here
a minute, but the crowd's in

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,750
the palm of her hand.
Could she be...?

17
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,875
'The Amazing Mystery Star.'

18
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,208
Under those conditions
I'd like to make a contract

19
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,125
with your theatre
company, Freedom Lights.

20
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,625
So? What do you say?

21
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,958
We did it!

22
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,958
We got a job! Oh yeah!

23
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,958
We can't wait to get started!

24
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,791
I'm glad to have you aboard.

25
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,291
Especially that masked
performer of yours.

26
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,875
You mean...?

27
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:26,791
Oh she was just incredible.
And I think our audiences would

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,833
like to see more of her,
not just that one maneuver.

29
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,333
But, sir that performer...

30
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,458
I understand. We'll
consider your suggestion.

31
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,208
I'm counting on you.

32
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,416
Why didn't you tell him
she's not in our company?

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,875
Right, how can we increase

34
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,125
the masked star's role when
we don't know who she is?

35
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,625
Will one of us have
to dress up like that?

36
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,666
That won't be necessary.

37
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,375
Because I know her identity.
The masked star's Layla!

38
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,875
I'm sorry, Miss Hamilton
isn't in right now.

39
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,666
Oh. Well, could you tell me what
time she'll be home tonight?

40
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,750
I'm afraid she won't
be home tonight.

41
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,375
She left for Europe yesterday,
to shoot her next movie.

42
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,041
What? She's in Europe?

43
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,041
But I could've sworn
I saw her today...

44
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,291
I'm sorry. I'll let
her know you called.

45
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,375
I can't believe it. If it's not
Layla, then who could she be?

46
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,375
We'll have to find
someone to take her place.

47
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,208
I think you're right. And
since someone caused this...

48
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,583
It sounds like we're
all in agreement then.

49
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:34,041
Here, try this on. Ta-dah!

50
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,708
It looks perfect! It was
worth staying up all night

51
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,125
just to finish it,
don't you think?

52
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,875
But it still doesn't look
right; Sora's too short.

53
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,916
And that's why I bought
these for her to wear.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,208
I can't perform
in shoes like that!

55
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,583
Hey, I've got an idea:

56
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,416
how about we try calling
Layla again, okay?

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,375
It's no use, she's
out of the country.

58
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,083
Even if she could come it would
take ten hours to get here.

59
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,833
You've gotta do it Sora.

60
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,208
Is it too late to tell
the park owner the truth?

61
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,041
That the masked star isn't
a member of our troupe and

62
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,333
we don't know who she is?

63
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,833
If we do that, he'll
void our contract, Sora.

64
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,708
Good morning. Hey, listen --

65
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,500
Good morning.

66
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,083
Rosetta!

67
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,125
Does anyone want to tell me what
the masked star's doing here?

68
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,916
And why she doesn't
look like she did yesterday?

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,041
Oh. Rosetta, that's just
because it's-- it's me.

70
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,166
But why are you--

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,750
You saw right through
my disguise, didn't you?

72
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Now tell them I can't go on as
the masked performer, all right?

73
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,458
You were going
to pretend to be her?

74
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,416
Well...

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,583
Awesome! That's a great idea!

76
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,625
What?!

77
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,458
Here. Look at today's newspaper.

78
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,958
It's about our show!

79
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,291
'I ended up going to

80
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,541
the Marine Park with
my wife and kids yesterday.

81
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,791
Much to my surprise,
we were treated to a show

82
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,458
that was as good as,
if not better than,

83
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,333
anything I've seen in Las Vegas.

84
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,916
The highlight of the show
was the masked performer,

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
whose brief cameo was one
of the most daring things

86
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,750
I've ever seen.

87
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,666
I highly recommend catching
the show just for her.

88
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,875
Make sure not to miss it.'

89
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,125
I'll bet this article

90
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,166
means we're gonna have
a huge audience today.

91
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,125
Oh no, Mia. I'm sure
that that won't happen!

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,083
You've got plenty of time

93
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,541
to see the masked
performer today, people.

94
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,625
I don't want to
see any pushing.

95
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,708
Everyone must enter the
park in an orderly fashion.

96
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,583
So all these people came just
because of a newspaper article?

97
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,875
What are we going to do?

98
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,166
Oh, good, I've found you!

99
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,625
This is the biggest crowd
we've ever had at the park,

100
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,958
and it's all thanks to you.

101
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

102
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:38,708
We're pleased as punch.

103
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,041
I wasn't talking to you

104
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,000
I was talking to the
masked performer over there.

105
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,708
We understand.

106
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,416
She wanted me to tell you that
she's so glad she can help.

107
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,291
In fact that's what she's
trying to say right now.

108
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,500
I can't put my finger on it,
but she seems different.

109
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,291
Oh no, don't be
ridiculous, sir!

110
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:03,166
I guess I am being silly.
Anyhow, I came to say there's

111
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,041
a camera crew here today,
so make sure the show's good.

112
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,416
There's a camera crew?!

113
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,583
I suppose there's
no turning back now, Sora.

114
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,541
The flying jellyfish girl!
How humiliating...

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,333
Here we go! Yeah!

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,875
Any sign of the masked star?

117
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,500
Not yet.

118
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
Daddy, where's the lady
with the mask on?

119
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,083
She's gotta be
around here somewhere...

120
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,375
Yes, but where?

121
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,875
When is she coming?

122
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,791
I don't know, sweetie.

123
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,833
Look, there she is!

124
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,000
Zoom in!

125
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,458
Right. Huh?

126
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,583
What's wrong?

127
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know
she looks different...

128
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,916
Oh, I wish the real
masked star would show up...

129
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,875
It looks like I don't
have any other choice,

130
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,583
so I'm gonna do this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

131
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,333
Ah! Wha--?

132
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,750
Yea--

133
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,583
I don't see what everyone
was so wild about.

134
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,541
I got ripped off here.

135
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,375
What a rip-off!
I'm never going back--

136
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,083
We're so happy
you could come out.

137
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,791
The real Masked Star
will be back tomorrow,

138
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,416
so please come again, all right?

139
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,541
You'd better be
telling the truth.

140
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,333
I don't want to
waste another day.

141
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,666
I wouldn't dream of being
dishonest with you,

142
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,000
gentlemen, so please,

143
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,666
I'd like for you
to come again tomorrow.

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,291
I can't believe this...

145
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,875
What were you thinking?!

146
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,166
I only did it because...

147
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,125
I don't want to
hear your excuses,

148
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,458
I just want the
Masked Star here tomorrow

149
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,958
or else I'm going
to cancel your contract!

150
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,666
And you're all gonna have to
pay the forfeit, you hear me?

151
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,166
Have any of you thought
of a way out of this?

152
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,875
No, not me.

153
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,041
You know, I'm thinking...

154
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,416
Yeah, yeah?

155
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,416
That the Masked Star has got
to be Layla in disguise.

156
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,208
That's what you've been
thinking about all this time?

157
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,791
I never realized
you were so stubborn.

158
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,083
You can keep on thinking
that, but it's impossible.

159
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,291
Then who else do you
think it could be?

160
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,333
We don't know, Sora,
that's our problem.

161
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,000
Because Layla said...

162
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,541
You may be able to
close Kaleido Stage down,

163
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,875
but don't think that means I'll
never be able to perform again.

164
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,583
If I didn't believe that,

165
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,875
I don't think I'd have the
heart to go on stage today.

166
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,041
I know that that's
how Layla really feels.

167
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,250
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm too busy.

168
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,416
I wouldn't even have
the time to rehearse.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,833
Besides, my Father's
handles my schedule now,

170
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
he feels I should do films.

171
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,791
She looked like she was forcing
herself to say those things,

172
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,250
that she didn't
really mean it at all.

173
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,458
That's why I guess I was
so certain that Layla

174
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,083
was the Masked Star.

175
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,083
But I guess everyone's
right, it's impossible...

176
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,750
Well, then, I'm afraid that we
simply have no other choice.

177
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,375
No other choice than what?

178
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,458
We'll have to make
them cancel the show.

179
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,666
How can we do that?

180
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,916
Do a rain dance!

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,833
Rain, rain, please fall down.

182
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,833
Rain, rain, please fall down.

183
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,291
Raaiin, raaaaiiin.
Rainy-rainy raaaiin.

184
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,583
Fall doooowwwwn.
Fall-a-fall-a doooowwwn...

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,458
All that chanting for nothing...

186
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,666
Well, it didn't work,

187
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,458
but at least we can
say we tried our best.

188
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,750
Now we'd best get
to the Marine Park.

189
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,291
Right.

190
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,791
And don't worry about how we're
going to pay the forfeit.

191
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,375
We can't pay it,

192
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,916
we'll never have enough money
in all the rest of our lives.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,250
Once you resign yourself to
that fact that you'll be paying

194
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,375
this off forever,
you'll feel much better.

195
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,083
Somehow I feel worse...

196
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,666
Good morning.

197
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,666
Oh Kate, good morning.

198
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,958
Is there something the
matter with the girls today?

199
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,791
Yes, well they're they're

200
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,166
just a little bit depressed
right at the moment.

201
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh. Hey, Sarah? You don't
happen to know what's going on

202
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,166
with Yuri's Kaleido Stage?

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,833
There haven't been any
injuries down at the E.R.

204
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,333
That's just how Yuri
runs his show now.

205
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,833
Nobody does any real tricks,
it's all done by computers.

206
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,000
So that's why.

207
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,583
And I suppose that's why
Layla won't be in his company,

208
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,791
because she wouldn't have a
chance to show off her skills.

209
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,416
That's it exactly.

210
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,625
And as an E.R. doctor it
doesn't give me a chance

211
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,166
to use my skills.

212
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you fret,

213
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,833
because the Masked Star will
definitely be here today!

214
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,708
We've got half an hour
until we start the show.

215
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,750
Half an hour of
financial freedom.

216
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,833
And then we're slaves for life.

217
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,791
Hey, don't say that...

218
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,875
Why not, because the Masked
Star isn't gonna show up.

219
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,500
And then we'll have to forfeit.

220
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,041
And then we'll have to pay this
debt for the rest of our lives,

221
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,166
and then our children'll
have to pay it!

222
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry but these kids

223
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,541
wanted to see if they
could get some autographs.

224
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:09,250
Uh, sure. Oh, wait the Masked
Star isn't here right now,

225
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,041
so you can't get her autograph.

226
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
That's all right 'cause

227
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,416
we came here to get that
lady's autograph, anyway.

228
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,083
You mean...

229
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,291
Here!

230
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,541
They're beautiful!

231
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,958
My brother and me
really liked your show.

232
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,916
Tell her how much you liked it.

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,916
We saw it the day
before yesterday,

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,458
and it was the coolest!

235
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,125
So you came back
to see it again.

236
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,833
Right. We had to! 

237
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,708
But my brother didn't
have enough money for

238
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,583
his admission fee so he had to
beg my Mom for early allowance.

239
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,375
She made him promise to do
chores, like mowing the lawn,

240
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,791
cleaning the toilets
and being a dress dummy.

241
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,833
Melissa! You didn't have
to tell them all that!

242
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:51,125
And he, he helped me pay for
my ticket, too, so I told him

243
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,291
I'd help him mow
the lawn. Right?

244
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,750
No way.

245
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,958
Whenever you try to help me
with my chores it takes me

246
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,708
about three times as long
as it should to get them done.

247
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:05,500
That's not true! I'm a good
little helper, even Mom says so!

248
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,625
If they've worked so hard
to come back to the show

249
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,666
I can't let them down.
Well I'm glad you came back.

250
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,958
We're going to do a way better
show today than we have before.

251
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,291
It's going to be worth
all those extra chores.

252
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,208
We can't wait!

253
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,208
You won't be disappointed!

254
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,416
How could you tell them
something like that?

255
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,916
That's a tough
promise to keep, Sora.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,291
No. They made a big
sacrifice to come here.

257
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,041
I won't let them down!

258
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,708
So you see, we're going to lose
our contract today anyway,

259
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
but we've got fans out there
that are counting on us.

260
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,333
We've gotta make this show
our best yet. We don't need

261
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,916
the Masked Star to make
this an incredible show.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,333
Either way, we're going
to have to pay the forfeit.

263
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,291
We might as well enjoy
ourselves while we can.

264
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,333
Right. Mia how can
we make the show better?

265
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,291
You want me to come up with
something fifteen minutes

266
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,291
before showtime? Sounds
good-- I like a challenge.

267
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,666
While you're at it,

268
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,625
the rest of us will be
thinking about our routines.

269
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,708
Is there anything you can do
to make today's performance

270
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,166
better than yesterday's?

271
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
Did you come up with something?

272
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:24,083
Hold on. It takes five seconds
for each of these things to...

273
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,041
There. It's finished.
Ken, Marion,

274
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,041
I'm gonna need your help.

275
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,000
Doing what?

276
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,708
We'll take care of it.

277
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,666
Where are they? Your
circus show was supposed to

278
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,958
have started
fifteen minutes ago.

279
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:47,083
Are you sure those carnies
didn't just skip town?

280
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,416
That's a good one...

281
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,625
Here they go!

282
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,333
I can't see.

283
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,041
Uh... Come this way...

284
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,125
Hey! Look up there!

285
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:44,833
Who is it?

286
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,541
Is it the Masked Star?!

287
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,333
No, I don't think it is...

288
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,000
This way!

289
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,833
Don't you miss
one second of this.

290
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,416
Right.

291
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,791
I still can't see.

292
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,833
Hey. Come on I found
the perfect place!

293
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,291
But the sign says to keep out.

294
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,833
Do you wanna see or not?

295
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,458
I really hope those kids
are enjoying themselves.

296
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,500
It's the Masked Star!

297
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,583
Finally!

298
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,500
We love you!

299
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,708
Brava!

300
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,333
I don't care what anyone says.

301
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,750
There's only one person

302
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,791
in the world who can do
things like that, and she's--

303
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,166
I'm scared.

304
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,708
Just don't look down.

305
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,916
Those kids are in trouble!

306
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,541
Call a rescue team, quick!

307
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,541
Right!

308
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,250
That ladder's about to fall.

309
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,625
Should I...

310
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,791
I know, I'll use my rope!

311
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,125
Please help us!

312
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,333
I'm scared!

313
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,541
All right.

314
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,833
The Masked Star! She's coming
here! You go first all right?

315
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,416
But what about you?

316
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,291
Don't worry, she'll come
back for me, too, okay?

317
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,708
Melissa hurry!

318
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,583
Please hurry!

319
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,833
It's all right, I've got you.

320
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,125
She's gonna crash!

321
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,291
Just hold on to me, okay?

322
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh no!

323
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,291
I've got to get
back in control,

324
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,916
or else we're
both gonna get hurt.

325
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:14,750
I gotcha.

326
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,708
You're okay now.

327
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,916
Thank you so much.

328
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,000
I knew she was the
Masked Star! She had to be!

329
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,125
No one besides Layla
can perform like this.

330
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,666
The grace, the
physical strength...

331
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,958
it's all part of Layla's style.

332
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,166
Even her sense of
timing is the same.

333
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,916
I'm so glad I'm performing
with the star again!

334
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,791
The best part of this

335
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,833
is that Layla wants to be
a part of our company.

336
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,375
With her on our side,

337
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,708
we make better shows than we
ever did at Kaleido Stage.

338
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,291
It... it's giving me the feeling
that anything is possible.

339
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:28,083
One day Layla and I are gonna
star opposite each other again

340
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,833
with no masks.

341
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:48,708
The Chariot. An opportunity.
The time to act is right now.

342
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,583
Their show looks better
than our show does.

343
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,000
I know. We've got way
more computerized effects

344
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
than they do,

345
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
but our show just looks like
a boring version of theirs.

346
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,583
But they have to work
a lot harder than we do.

347
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,625
And we don't have to
worry about getting hurt.

348
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,125
Hey, how about we go practice?

349
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,083
And the children were
brought back to safety.

350
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,166
Following their daring rescue,
Sora Naegino and a woman known

351
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,000
only as the Masked Star resumed
their performance...

352
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:29,375
I know who you are. Layla.

353
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,541
Thank you for the flowers, Yuri.

354
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,000
So our company, Freedom Lights,

355
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,291
didn't lose its contract
after all. But...

356
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,250
...but Yuri started meddling
in our business again, and...

357
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,250
...and it seems like he's intent
on completely destroying us.

358
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,333
And when the Masked Star finally
revealed her true identity,

359
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,083
it was... it was... it was...

360
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,666
Be sure to join us next time

361
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,708
for 'The Amazing
Resolve Beneath the Mask.'

362
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,416
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
