1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,750
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,500
so make sure your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,666
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,458
My name is Sora Naegino.
Ever since I was a little girl

5
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,291
it's been my dream
to perform with Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,458
So a few months ago I came
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

7
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:41,000
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

8
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,875
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

9
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,208
from doing my best.
There's nothing I can't do

10
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,833
if I work hard!

11
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,333
Having friends
makes life so much easier.

12
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,041
I mean, whenever I have
a bad day, all I have to do

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,791
is tell Anna and Mia
about it and I feel better.

14
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,000
We don't always see eye to eye,
but we're always there for each

15
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,541
other, and we're always helping
each other be better performers.

16
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,000
With their help,
I just know I'll be a star

17
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,875
of Kaleido Stage someday!

18
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,916
The sting of humiliation,
the thrill of pursuit,

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,458
and the bliss of new love.
Kaleido Stage presents

20
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,666
'Cinderella.' Starring
Layla Hamilton in the title role

21
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,000
and Yuri Killian as her prince.
In the supporting roles,

22
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,625
we proudly present the
debut performances of our

23
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:06,125
newest troupe members.
Come experience all the romance,

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,458
the wonder, the danger
of this classic story...

25
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,583
Anna's gonna be really great
as the Prince's Attendant.

26
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,291
And Mia! She won the role of
the Fairy Godmother after some

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,458
really tough competition. I
can't wait to see them perform.

28
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,458
But I wish I had been cast, too.

29
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,625
So you're jealous, huh?

30
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,500
Well I guess I-- 

31
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,833
What are you doing back here?

32
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,958
Audience members aren't allowed
to come back stage, little girl.

33
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,666
And you're not allowed on stage.

34
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,833
Well I wouldn't say
that I'm not allowed.

35
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,500
I mean, I've been
on the stage before.

36
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,875
You must've been terrible.

37
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,666
Well it wasn't the best
performance but I was

38
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,375
just starting out. I mean, for
being my very first performance

39
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,166
it actually went pretty--

40
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,458
What a loser.

41
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,500
Who was that kid anyway?

42
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,250
'Try Hard and You'll Get
an Amazing Chance!'

43
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,333
Wow.

44
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,000
It looks like Mia's
gonna be awesome.

45
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,333
I know...

46
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,250
Come on, Mia, jump higher.

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,291
Okay.

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,083
Too slow.

49
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:28,833
Right.

50
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,666
Not high enough.

51
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,916
You've got to make the
audience want to watch you.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,041
Okay.

53
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,708
They've been
doing this all morning.

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,625
Haven't even taken a break.

55
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,625
What?

56
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:40,666
You're kidding! 

57
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,333
They must be exhausted.

58
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,083
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,958
Layla?

60
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,583
There's no point in doing it
again. You're not concentrating.

61
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,458
I'll get it right
this time, I swear...

62
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,333
Don't bother. This if
a very important scene, Mia.

63
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,416
If you aren't up to it, then
we'll find someone else who is.

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,625
Wha--?

65
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,000
This routine is the
climax of the first act.

66
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,166
If the Fairy Godmother's not
perfect we might as well cancel.

67
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,416
Please, Layla! Give me another
chance, please! I can do this,

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,583
I know I can! Layla?

69
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,750
What did I tell you?

70
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,166
I knew she'd never
be able to pull it off.

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,416
They should've cast me
for it in the first place.

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,416
So are they gonna
cancel the performance?

73
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,958
They'll have to if
that doesn't get any better.

74
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,541
Mia!

75
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,541
Are you all right?

76
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,625
You should take a break
before you hurt yourself.

77
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,208
Leave me alone.

78
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,791
You can't nail that routine if
you don't take care of yourself.

79
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,916
Go away. I have
to keep practicing.

80
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,000
Why bother? It's not
like you're ever gonna

81
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,625
get better at it
anyway. You stink.

82
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,791
It's you again.

83
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,416
You know this kid?

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,625
Marion! Don't interrupt
practice. Get back over here.

85
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,041
Okay.

86
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,333
Cute kid.

87
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,333
Yeah, right.

88
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,250
Who is she?

89
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,666
Her name is Marion.

90
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,125
She's the daughter of Jean,
one of our carpenters.

91
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,833
That's why she was backstage...

92
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,541
Is she always that sweet?

93
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,125
A few years ago, her mother was
the star of our trampoline act.

94
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,875
So she really knows a lot
about performing on it.

95
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,500
I guess she can be
kind of critical when

96
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,291
she sees someone who's
not... well... not quite up

97
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,208
to her standards.

98
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,166
So, who's her mother?

99
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,625
Uh, you've never met her.
She died a while ago.

100
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,416
Collapsed one day after
she came off the stage.

101
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh that's awful.

102
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,916
Yeah. Must've been rough.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,250
It was.

104
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,166
Mia...?

105
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,375
I'm fine. I'm
going back to work.

106
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,958
You know, Mia's grandmother
isn't doing too well.

107
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,625
She's having surgery
on our opening day.

108
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,458
Really? So, was Layla right
about Mia not being able

109
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,541
to concentrate?

110
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,166
I mean, if she's worried abou--

111
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,333
No, uh uh, I think
she's concentrating too hard.

112
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,833
What?

113
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,791
Mia's grandmother has always
been her biggest supporter,

114
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,291
and I know that Mia
doesn't want to let her down.

115
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,416
When they found out that
our opening and her surgery

116
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,791
were on the same day,
they made a pact.

117
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
They both agreed
to do their best.

118
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,000
So that's why she's pushing
herself so hard in practice.

119
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,250
Right. But the thing
about Mia is...

120
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,916
she loses her cool
when she tries too hard.

121
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,708
I'm so sorry, Grandma.

122
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:47,041
But... I may not be able to
keep up my end of the bargain.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,250
Make Fairy Godmother
a three-person role?

124
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,250
How about it?

125
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,291
You're joking.

126
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,208
I think it sounds interesting.

127
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,250
Wouldn't that make it
more difficult?

128
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,791
It would, but I know Anna,
Sora and I would do a great job.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,791
You want...?

130
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,208
Really?

131
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,583
Come again?

132
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right, I'd be
performing with Anna and Sora.

133
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,583
What?! We can't do that!

134
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,750
You don't want to?

135
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,791
Uh, that's not the point.

136
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,291
It doesn't matter anyway.

137
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,666
Kalos would never authorize
this kind of casting change.

138
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,333
Go ahead.

139
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,541
It's a rather
interesting idea,

140
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,708
and I'm curious to see
what you girls will do with it.

141
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,916
I'll make sure the director
and Layla are okay with it.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,083
You mean it's all right
with you that I appear on stage?

143
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,625
That depends on the level
of your performance.

144
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,458
I will give you
three days ladies.

145
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,083
If I do not like what I see
after that I'm following

146
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,541
Layla's suggestion and
canceling all the performances.

147
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,416
Understood?

148
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,416
Yes! Thank you so much, boss.

149
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,833
Yeah!

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,208
Yay!

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,541
I can't believe he's
letting us perform together.

152
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, but now we have to
create the coolest trick ever.

153
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,500
Thanks a lot, guys.

154
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,708
No, thank you; without you
I wouldn't be on stage.

155
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,750
Sora?

156
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,208
Are you okay?

157
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,958
I'm starting to have fun
handing out the toys.

158
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,750
But to be on stage is--

159
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,541
well, that's the whole reason
why I came here isn't it?

160
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,708
And now thanks to you guys I
might just get another chance!

161
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,958
So how 'bout we get
this party started?

162
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,166
That's right,
let's get you on stage.

163
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,458
Thanks, guys.

164
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,791
And then this is the climax.

165
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,250
We all jump towards the
center and we hand off wands.

166
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,958
That's the ninth routine

167
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,541
where we've all ended up
with massive head injuries.

168
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,541
Well look on the bright side,

169
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,250
at least the three of us
are only getting maimed

170
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,833
in a simulation.

171
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,416
Don't worry, guys,
I'll come up with something.

172
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,375
It's gotta be
spectacular, though,

173
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,750
or else they're gonna cancel.

174
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,125
What comes to mind
when you think 'Cinderella?'

175
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,291
The glass slippers.
What comes to mind for you?

176
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,041
The handsome pumpkin prince.

177
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,500
That's not part of the story.

178
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,083
Well it should be.

179
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:24,916
That's it!

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,291
That is it!

181
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,541
You're not talking about
the pumpkin prince, are you?

182
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,125
Oh, let me play that role!

183
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,208
No.

184
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,375
What? Why?

185
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,916
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,208
But check this out:

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,083
we'll put some kind
of device in our wands

188
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,000
so that when we jump out
we spread a triangle of fabric.

189
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:48,666
And then when we jump up... See?
A pumpkin! What do you think?

190
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,166
Wow.

191
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,083
That's a pretty cool trick.
It's gonna be tough, though.

192
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,416
I mean, if we don't jump
to exactly the right height

193
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,750
at exactly the right time, it's
not gonna look like a pumpkin.

194
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,166
I know. But I'm not done yet.
Once we make the pumpkin,

195
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
I was thinking Cinderella
could appear inside it.

196
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,000
That is so cool.

197
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,375
You really think we'll be
able to put all that together

198
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,625
in three days?

199
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,375
We'll just have
to get practicing.

200
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,208
I think I'll call it
'The Triple Illusion.'

201
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,000
The Triple Illusion?

202
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,958
'Cause there are three of us.

203
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,500
Good name.

204
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,041
Then it's settled. Intensive
training for the Triple Illusion

205
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,500
starts first thing tomorrow.

206
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,458
This is gonna be great.

207
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,250
Yeah!

208
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,833
I've got to work hard.

209
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,958
Mia put her neck on the
line to get me this chance.

210
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,708
I'm not gonna let her down!

211
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,833
What's the problem, little one?

212
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,083
What the heck
are you doing in my bed?

213
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,416
What, there's not
enough room? Lie down.

214
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,750
No way.

215
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,750
Suit yourself. I was
just offering to help you...

216
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,041
Help me, how?

217
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,500
Just a bit of friendly advice:

218
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,958
don't partner up
with those two girls.

219
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,083
But why?

220
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,041
The level of talent
is too different.

221
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,500
I know I stink.

222
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,166
But I'll never get better
unless I work with good people.

223
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,750
Sora, you're not the problem.

224
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,208
Hey.

225
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,833
Turn off the light, will you?
I've gotta get some sleep.

226
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,666
The inverted star.
It foretells failure.

227
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,958
Will you just
turn off the light!

228
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,291
Oh fine.

229
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,666
I'm sorry.
I messed it up again.

230
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,916
Quit apologizing.
All of us were off.

231
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
I just can't catch it.

232
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:04,750
I mean I feel like I keep making
the same mistake over and over.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,416
Sorry.

234
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,750
Stop taking responsibility,
Sora, the three of us

235
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,916
just weren't synchronized.

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,083
We're just not working
as a team yet.

237
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,791
Back me up here.

238
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,041
Mia?

239
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,125
If you don't think I can do this
routine, it's okay just tell m--

240
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,541
I never said you couldn't do it.

241
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:33,833
My timing was messed up,

242
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,750
so it's just as much
my fault as anyone else's.

243
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,083
No, it's my fault.

244
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,916
For having this stupid idea
in the first place.

245
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,458
You people are pathetic.

246
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,625
No-talent losers like you

247
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,125
have no business
being on that trampoline.

248
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,250
I mean, do you even know
how stupid you sound?

249
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,500
'It's my fault.'
'No, it's my fault.'

250
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,666
Back off, kid. This isn't
any of your business.

251
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,666
Get out of here!

252
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:05,250
You're not fit...
you're not fit... any of you

253
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,166
to use the same trampoline
as my mother did.

254
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,458
Marion... Marion!

255
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,666
Look, I'm sorry about that. 

256
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,500
She just-- she took her
mother's death really hard.

257
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,708
Come on, let's get back to work.

258
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,541
Miss Layla?

259
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,000
Uh...

260
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,041
Kalos told me about
your Fairy Godmother idea.

261
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,875
I think it could be interesting.

262
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,833
Oh, I'm so glad you think so!

263
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,250
Provided, of course,

264
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,000
that all three people in
the routine are up to the task.

265
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,583
Yes, we're working hard!

266
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,541
Unfortunately I don't think
Sora and Anna are ready yet.

267
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,000
Charlotte and Julie are
more experienced performers,

268
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,666
so I'm suggesting them
for the roles.

269
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,791
But Sora and Anna are the
reasons why I suggested this--

270
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,083
This is not a slumber party.
They may be your friends, but

271
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,000
they're not the most competent
trampoline artists we have.

272
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,375
If you're not happy

273
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,000
with my casting changes
then you can step down, too.

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,291
Mia...

275
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,625
Come on, let's go.

276
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,416
But we--

277
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,708
It's okay. Layla's right.

278
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,750
Don't feel bad.
We're just better than you.

279
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,000
That's the way
things go sometimes.

280
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,416
You look like you
could use some coffee.

281
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Huh? Oh, sorry, you scared me.

282
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,333
No, I'm sorry.

283
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,250
Marion said some
terrible things to you.

284
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,875
No it's okay, she's just a kid.

285
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,708
Still...

286
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,750
Besides, it kinda turned out

287
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,125
that she was
right about us anyway...

288
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,458
I'm sorry to hear that.

289
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,541
It seems like the three
of you were working so hard.

290
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,625
It's okay.
I'm sure Layla's right:

291
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,416
those girls are just
better than we are.

292
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,166
So, is Marion okay?

293
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
Oh, she will be once
she's finished sulking

294
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,875
in the rehearsal hall.
It's her favorite hiding place.

295
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,833
But she'll be back as soon
as she gets hungry enough.

296
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,666
Uh...?

297
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,791
What?

298
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,625
That stuff Marion
said about her mom.

299
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,041
Yeah?

300
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,791
It must be really rough
not having her around anymore.

301
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,333
I mean, she seemed really upset.

302
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,166
It's pretty rough on all of us
not having Cynthia around.

303
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,291
But Marion seems
to take it the hardest,

304
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,333
and sometimes things
really upset her.

305
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,291
My wife was
an amazing woman, Sora.

306
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,958
Six years ago she was
the star of Kaleido Stage.

307
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,958
She had talent like
you wouldn't believe.

308
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,208
Still, nobody worked
harder than she did.

309
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,500
You can never practice too much.
Talent will only get you so far.

310
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,791
If you really want to be
a star you have to work for it.

311
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,958
Every single day.

312
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,291
As Marion got older,
I think she started resenting

313
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,625
how much time
Cynthia spent working.

314
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,166
One day Marion got a fever. 

315
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,958
She wanted Cynthia to stay
home with her, but Cynthia had

316
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,125
a show and there was no one
who could go on for her.

317
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,875
She had to perform. 

318
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,750
And I guess maybe she
wasn't able to concentrate

319
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,958
like she normally did.

320
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,875
There was a terrible accident.

321
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,333
We got her
to the hospital alive,

322
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,541
but she was
slipping away from us.

323
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,833
Sweetheart, what are
you apologizing for?

324
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,333
I'm the one who made a mistake.

325
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,333
This is my fault, no one else's.

326
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,875
Once I get out of here I'll have
to practice harder than ever.

327
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,875
We can't have this
happen again, can we?

328
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,916
She died on the operating table.
Those were her last words.

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,750
Marion sort of shut down after
that. And she's gotten bitter,

330
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,416
because she doesn't think
anyone here is as good as

331
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,166
her mother was. Sorry to say
it, but you girls aren't the

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,875
first people she's yelled at.

333
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,916
I can understand why.

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,666
I mean, it sounds like she
loved watching her mother work.

335
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,875
She just wants everyone
at Kaleido Stage to be

336
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,791
as good as they can be.

337
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,208
Thank you.

338
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,166
I'm sorry I never
got to see her perform.

339
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,416
Sounds like I missed
something really great.

340
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,708
Listening to you talk about
how hard she worked makes

341
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,833
me realize that I well, I've
got a lot more practicing to do

342
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,333
before I'm ever gonna get on
stage here. I should go tell Mia

343
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,041
that I understand now.

344
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,833
Miss Layla was right. I wasn't
up to performance level.

345
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,125
Not yet. But that's why
I've gotta work hard, right?

346
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,208
'Morning, Marion.

347
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,291
Dad, she...

348
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,625
She's been practicing in here
for a couple of hours so far.

349
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,416
Says she's never gonna get
any better unless she works

350
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
really hard at it.

351
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,666
No!

352
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:43,041
Owww. Oh my gosh,
Anna! Are you okay?

353
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,375
I would be if you'd get offa
me. You should watch where

354
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,166
you're landing next time.

355
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,458
Sorry about that.

356
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,916
You think it's funny
you almost crushed me?

357
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,333
Let's get back to work.

358
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,375
Mia.

359
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,958
Where are Charlotte and Julie?

360
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,125
Shouldn't you guys
be practicing?

361
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,750
I gave up the role.

362
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,500
What?

363
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,833
But why'd you do that?

364
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,750
Well I decided I'd rather
perfect the Triple Illusion

365
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,833
with you.

366
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,500
And my Grandma always says

367
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,541
that good friends
should be cherished.

368
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,833
Mia...

369
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,333
Sorry, you guys.

370
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,875
It shouldn't have taken me
this long to do the right thing.

371
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,208
Are you sure this
is what you want to do?

372
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,041
Well, actually I haven't
given up the part just yet.

373
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,291
What?

374
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,458
He promised us three days.
We still have time

375
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,375
to get the Triple Illusion
working the way it should.

376
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,583
If it still doesn't work by the
deadline we'll resign our roles.

377
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,083
Okay.

378
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,000
Thank you.

379
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,500
I think those girls are gonna
be first-class Kaleido Stars.

380
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,541
Me, too.

381
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,333
Well then what
are we waiting for?

382
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,875
Right.

383
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,041
On the spins: I'll slow mine
down a little bit, but, Sora,

384
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,625
you need to speed yours up.

385
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,166
That sounds good.

386
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,916
And while you guys are busy
spinnin' around I'll throw in

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,833
a monkey pose.

388
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,333
No, you won't.

389
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,333
We've only got one day left,
so we've really gotta work.

390
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,958
I thought I saw Mommy...

391
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,541
Oh, it was nothing. Can we
get something to eat Daddy?

392
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,333
I thought you'd never ask.

393
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:16,208
The Star foretells hope.
What do you know?

394
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,958
She changed the future.

395
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,375
Everybody's here, so start
whenever you guys are ready.

396
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,625
Right.

397
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,875
What do you think?

398
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,333
These girls aren't
very polished performers.

399
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,000
But still, you were
on the edge of your seat

400
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,958
while they were
doing their routine.

401
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,375
They're pretty captivating;

402
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,875
I think all they need's
a push in the right direction.

403
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,583
Well, Kalos, it looks like you
have your work cut out for you.

404
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,416
I guess that means
they passed. For now anyway.

405
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,416
Sora, come home.

406
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,875
I won't get on that plane unless
you agree to come with me.

407
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,916
Just in time for the opening
of 'Cinderella' my Dad

408
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,791
decided to make
a surprise visit.

409
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,041
Sora's Dad wants her
to go back to Japan.

410
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,750
I know this is tough
for you but, Sora,

411
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,708
we've got a show to do.

412
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,750
I--I'm sorry, guys...

413
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,500
What?!

414
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,750
Now I have to decide

415
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,916
between the wishes of
my family and my dream.

416
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,541
What should I do? I wonder?
I wonder? I wonder?

417
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,208
Next time on Kaleido Star
'My Amazingly Distant Family'.

418
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,958
My wings are my dreams,
and on towards the sky...
