1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,833
Hey everyone!
Kaleido Star's gonna start soon.

2
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,458
You'd better make sure that
your room is brightly lit.

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,500
Oh! And don't sit
too close to the TV!

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,458
Well, well, well. Have you
guys ever been impatient?

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,666
I mean when you wanna
do something so bad

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,458
that you've gotta do it now!

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,666
You just want time to go faster.
You wanna scream, "come on"!

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,583
I gave an unexpected
show at the bank,

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,500
and I remembered how
much I love being on stage!

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,333
Now Mr. Kenneth
wants us to perform

11
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,625
at the debut of his
new line of cars.

12
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,750
I get to perform!
I'm gonna do my best!

13
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,166
I will! I will!

14
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,250
Yes. I agree with you.

15
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,500
You don't understand,
I was really moved.

16
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,291
Sora Naegino is the best, ever!

17
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,166
Thanks to her, I'm gonna start
chasing my dream again too.

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,666
Yes. I've terminated
her contract

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,625
and all of our performances
have been cancelled, but...

20
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,958
anywhere Sora goes
becomes a stage.

21
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,208
It's almost as if
the stage itself

22
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,833
is calling her back to it.

23
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:56,041
Yes. He's investigating
that now.

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,916
However, it seems that Leon
Oswald really does hold the key.

25
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh, that's it!

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,916
What is it, Mr. Kenneth?

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,708
I just had a great idea.

28
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,416
An idea?

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,291
Launching an Amazing Smile!

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
Yeah!

31
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,500
And here I go!

32
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,041
Awesome!

33
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,125
It almost seems as if she
can't stand being still.

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,000
Ever since she gave that
incredible performance

35
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,500
at the bank the other day,

36
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,916
it's like she can't contain
herself, even if she tried!

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,125
But I guess that's just Sora's
style, so it's a good thing.

38
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,666
Yup!

39
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,833
Making dust go bye bye,
everything is sparkly,

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,958
cleaning can be fun, yeah....

41
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,000
Now everybody's happy!

42
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,666
What?! Are you serious?

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,208
Yes. Yes. I understand.

44
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,083
Yes. Yes. I'm on my way!

45
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,333
Oh, big news!

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
What?! For real?

47
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,500
For real, I just heard!

48
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,791
This'll be great!

49
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,833
It looks like it's finally
time for me to put

50
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,833
the top secret project I've
been working on into action.

51
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,250
Are you sure about that? Anna?

52
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,458
Oh, yeah. I wanna
try and give it a shot.

53
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,833
Alright then.
I won't try to stop you.

54
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,958
There's only one problem.

55
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,666
I'd really like to find at least
one more performer.

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,208
Give it your best shot, Anna.

57
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,375
Yeah, I will. You too.

58
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,083
Aiming for...

59
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,916
Our dreams!

60
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,375
Sora was able to captivate
that bank robber,

61
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,666
and she wasn't even on stage.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
But... I can't even please
Leon on the real stage.

63
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,625
I can't figure out what
I could be missing.

64
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,833
I await your instruction.

65
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,250
Where's Miss Cathy?

66
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,083
I'm sorry, but your
training is over.

67
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,916
To go any further
would be pointless.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,750
But why?

69
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,375
Don't you think this
is getting ridiculous?

70
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,708
No, I think I'm doing the
best I possibly can for you.

71
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,916
I don't know that there's
anything more I could do.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,916
Maybe I should show you by
making Sora come in and do this.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,833
Are you saying...
I'm not good enough?

74
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,458
When we met in New York,
you said that it was

75
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,791
your dream to perform
on stage with me.

76
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,791
But when I asked you what you
wanted to accomplish after that,

77
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,875
you weren't able to
answer my question.

78
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,125
You still can't answer, can you?

79
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,166
During your training,
I've realized what it is

80
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,416
that you're missing.
It's the most important thing

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,875
for a performer to
remember on stage.

82
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,333
All this time you seemed
desperate to know the secret

83
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,958
so that you could free
yourself from our training.

84
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,750
But I never felt for a second

85
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,375
that you were passionate
about entertaining me or Cathy.

86
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,333
May... what do you
want to achieve

87
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,458
after becoming
Leon's partner?

88
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,708
What about after
you defeat Sora?

89
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,333
What do you really want?

90
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:24,041
What are you trying
to get from performing?

91
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,375
Small goals like
"becoming Leon's partner"

92
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,250
and "defeating Sora"
are not your real dream.

93
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,708
Think about what
you want after that.

94
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,916
Nobody can help
you figure it out.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,666
You'll have to find
that out on your own.

96
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,500
I think what you
really need to learn

97
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,458
is the importance
of a smile, May.

98
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,041
The importance of a smile?

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,291
I don't get it.

100
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,875
Why'd they want us
to show up here?

101
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,833
I dunno.

102
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,500
Anna and the others
aren't here yet,

103
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,750
but it looks like
everyone else is ready.

104
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,291
Okay.

105
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,375
I know this is sudden.
We won't have much time,

106
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,833
but you guys have been selected
to do a special performance

107
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,750
for the Kenneth Motor Company's
New Model Event.

108
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:16,041
Sora, you'll be performing
as part of the group as well.

109
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,208
You mean I get to perform again?

110
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,375
That's right! Mr. Kenneth
wanted you to be in the show!

111
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,958
Wow! Really, you mean it?

112
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,708
Isn't that fantastic?

113
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,750
Yay, I'm so excited
for you, Sora!

114
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,083
This is gonna be great!

115
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,125
I think what you
really need to learn

116
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,541
is the importance
of a smile, May.

117
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,458
She was trying to
say that Sora knows.

118
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,791
Okay Mia, why don't you go ahead
and explain the show's set up?

119
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,333
Right.

120
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,833
Oh no! Before I get into that,
I have to take care of this!

121
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,458
You'd better not
embarrass me, roger?

122
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,541
And now, I'm proud to present
to you our new comedic act.

123
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,750
Let's hear it for Anna
and the Amazing Clowns!

124
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,125
--Oh, wow!
--Come on out!

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,875
Anna?

126
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,875
--Cater.
--Pillar.

127
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,916
--Cater...
--Pillar.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,916
--Cater.
--Pillar.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,958
What?

130
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,083
--Cater.
--Pillar.

131
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,666
--Cater...
--Pillar.

132
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,208
Sit!

133
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,833
Okay, clowns! We're gonna do
this just like we practiced.

134
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,791
Cater... pillar!

135
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,166
--Oh, that's amazing!
--Bravo!

136
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,166
Wow!

137
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,041
Cater cater cater cater...

138
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,750
Pillar pillar pillar pillar...

139
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,416
Cater cater cater cater...

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Pillar pillar pillar pillar...

141
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,041
It's Ken!

142
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,875
--You lost our end!
--The rear end!

143
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,791
It's not what
you're thinking, Sora!

144
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,291
I knew you'd steal the show,

145
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,291
but I guess I am the one who
asked you to join our team.

146
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,666
We made a deal for today only!

147
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,583
I'm not joining your team, Anna!

148
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,625
Why not?
You should join the team.

149
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,541
So do you think it's okay
for Anna and the Clowns

150
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,375
to participate in the show?

151
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,500
Of course it is.

152
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,125
We did it!

153
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,833
Well I'm only gonna be in
this one show, you hear me?

154
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,416
Congratulations, Ken!

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, thank you!

156
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,166
Alright gang, why don't
we go over the show?

157
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,125
Now, the theme of the show
is "Nature and Beauty."

158
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,666
Sora... Naegino...

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,583
I'm gonna fall!

160
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,583
She may be able to perfect
the "Angel's Maneuver."

161
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,375
She could carry out the
dream that you could not.

162
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,208
Sophie...

163
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,958
Please promise me... Leon.

164
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:52,500
I made a promise... Yes.

165
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:59,958
This may be the only thing
that I can do for you. But...

166
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:07,750
Flowers? From who? May?

167
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,958
Rosetta... I'm gonna
go out for a bit.

168
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,541
Um, okay.
Where are you going?

169
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,541
To Layla's.

170
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,750
Miss Layla's?

171
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,958
For a bit. I need
to go let her know

172
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,791
that I'm gonna be
back on stage again.

173
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,958
If I don't, I'd feel like I was
doing it behind her back.

174
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,791
Okay, well have fun!

175
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,250
Please have a seat.

176
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,833
She'll be right down.

177
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,375
Thanks!

178
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,875
Miss Layla!

179
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,625
You can sit down.

180
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,916
I was worried that you
wouldn't meet with me.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,458
Why, because of the festival?

182
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,125
Well, yeah.

183
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,750
I've realized that I was
wrong about you, Sora.

184
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,916
I thought that I could
make you desire

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,750
the same dreams I
once aspired to.

186
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,708
I thought you could pull
through on any stage,

187
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,750
no matter how cruel it was.
But I was wrong.

188
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,125
I pushed you too hard,
and because of that,

189
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,750
you won't even challenge
May for a role.

190
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,750
Your dream was never to
become a true Kaleido Star.

191
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,875
It was to enjoy
yourself on stage.

192
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,625
That's not completely true.

193
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,083
I mean, yes, my dream
is to someday have

194
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,625
a fun Kaleido Stage
with no competition.

195
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,625
But I do wanna be
a Kaleido Star,

196
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,958
and I haven't given
up on that dream.

197
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,458
You're saying you want
to become a Kaleido Star

198
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,666
without having to
compete with anyone?

199
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,166
Yes. I'm afraid there's
no other path for me.

200
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,458
You realize that nobody has
ever become a Kaleido Star

201
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,333
without having to compete
in one way or another.

202
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,500
I don't even know
if that's possible.

203
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,875
Listen to me, Sora,
that path may be

204
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,833
more difficult than you
could ever imagine.

205
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,166
Maybe so. But no
matter how difficult

206
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,458
the path may be, it's still
the path that I've chosen.

207
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,166
This time I'm not
gonna lose my way.

208
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,375
I'm sorry. But I won't be
following your dream, Layla.

209
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,458
I've gotta follow my own.

210
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,208
Sora...

211
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,750
I think you've made
the right decision.

212
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,250
You should continue to
follow your dreams.

213
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,500
I will.

214
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,208
I wanted to let you
know that I'm gonna be

215
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,541
in the Kenneth
Motor Show coming up.

216
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,125
I'm gonna make sure the
show's a lot of fun!

217
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,958
I look forward to it.

218
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:49,166
Sora's eyes... they've gotten
their sparkle back.

219
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,458
What is this feeling... that's
taken over me all of a sudden?

220
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,250
And then she smiled.
And she said that I'd made

221
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,916
the right decision and I should
keep following my dream.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,125
Is that right.

223
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,208
I'm really glad that
I went to talk to her.

224
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,000
I just have to make
sure that I never

225
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,083
lose sight of my dreams again.

226
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,583
I don't wanna make her worry,

227
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,833
and I really want her
to see me succeed.

228
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,875
I wonder if Layla still
has the ability to see me.

229
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
Huh? Did you say something?

230
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,625
--I didn't.
--Oh.

231
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,250
Anyway, since you'll be
performing for a car company,

232
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,375
I think you should dress
like a sexy racing queen,

233
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,000
--and then you can...
--Forget about it!

234
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,916
The theme for the unveiling is
"harmony with nature".

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,416
So I think we need
costumes that have

236
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,750
something to do with nature.

237
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,250
Nature costumes?

238
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,916
Something simple,
with very little decoration.

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,458
Very little decoration?!

240
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,791
It should be something really
bold.

241
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,166
A bold concept like naked?!

242
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,791
Tomorrow, then! I'll see you
in the dressing room! Farewell!

243
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,625
At tomorrow's show I'll
try to act just like Sora.

244
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,833
That may be the only way
I can redeem myself.

245
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,458
Hey, can you hand me that
makeup case over there?

246
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay everyone, listen up
while you're changing.

247
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,458
I just went and
checked out the stage.

248
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,541
The positioning of the cars
is a little different than

249
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,500
originally planned, but other
than that everything's great.

250
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,041
I know you're all nervous since
this is our first show for them

251
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,833
and we haven't had
any rehearsals,

252
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,000
but if we just stick to
the plan we'll be fine.

253
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,708
So everyone calm down and relax!

254
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,250
What was that?

255
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,000
Maybe it's some kind of
weird good luck charm?

256
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,291
Oh man, I gotta hurry
up and get changed!

257
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,083
Wait! Your name is Ken, right?
Help me, can't you see me?

258
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,375
Come on Ken, help me out!

259
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,583
He's useless.

260
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,208
What?! Are you kidding?

261
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,666
You can't spring this
on us without warning!

262
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,541
Are you saying your
performers can't cope with it?

263
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,208
I'm sure they can,
but the trapeze act

264
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,000
will have to be
completely changed.

265
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,458
Come on, won't you
please reconsider, sir?

266
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,708
We'll be safe, I promise.

267
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,000
That's enough!

268
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,875
Am I mistaken, or was a
Kaleido Stage performer

269
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,208
seriously injured recently?

270
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,250
Doing the show without a net
is out of the question.

271
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,875
Since we'll be filming the
event, I've had them put the net

272
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,208
up as high as possible to ensure
that it doesn't show on screen.

273
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,166
What?!

274
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,875
There's a net?

275
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,416
I'm sorry, guys.

276
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,875
It was my mistake, I should have
thought about this earlier.

277
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,000
We'll have to come up
with something quick.

278
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,791
If we don't, I'm afraid
we'll have to cut

279
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,500
the trapeze act
from the show.

280
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,541
Don't you think it's a
little late for that now?

281
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,416
Don't worry, I'll go
and take a look.

282
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,125
Well, then I'm going with you.

283
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,833
The trapezes are a lot
higher than normal.

284
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah, and with the
building being a pyramid

285
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,291
the high part is pretty narrow.

286
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,208
We won't be able to
use the trampoline,

287
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,875
because the net's in the way.

288
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,583
We can't do much
of a show like this.

289
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,958
We have to do something,

290
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,708
cause we'll be too far from
the audience like this.

291
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,250
I got it, May! Do you
have a rope on you?

292
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,583
Why would I be
carrying around rope?!

293
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,916
I guess not.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,583
Sora! I brought along some
spare trapezes and rope.

295
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,041
I like to be prepared in case
something like this happens.

296
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,666
Wow, really?!
You're the best!

297
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,791
Great! Thank you so much, Ken!

298
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,208
Good job, Ken, way to
make yourself useful!

299
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,166
Yeah...

300
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,958
So what are we gonna do with it?

301
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,458
I think I have an idea.

302
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,208
So May, do you
wanna help me out?

303
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,875
I'll help out because
I'm part of the act.

304
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,666
Hey Rosetta, do you wanna
be on the trapeze with us?

305
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,791
Huh? You want me to
be on the trapeze?

306
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,583
You can't make that
decision on your own!

307
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,833
Oh I'm sorry May,

308
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,375
it's just I know Rosetta
really wants to do it.

309
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,791
I'll do it! I wanna be
on the trapeze, Sora!

310
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,125
I don't think she should do it.
I mean, she's never been

311
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,458
on the trapeze in front
of an audience before.

312
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,125
Yeah you're right, but the show
isn't gonna be very difficult.

313
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,041
I promise I'll do my best,
please let me do it, May!

314
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,416
Well, if you really want to.

315
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,375
I'll try and do
whatever Sora says.

316
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,708
After all, if we fail,
it'll be all her fault.

317
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,500
Okay, we don't have much time.

318
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,125
Sora, why don't you go ahead
and give us your idea?

319
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,666
Right!

320
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,166
Now then, do you think
Sora will be capable

321
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,833
of making this stage her own?
Or do you think that your team

322
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,916
will suddenly break up and fall
apart while they're in midair?

323
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,958
I don't know about all this.

324
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,583
Your idea is basically
an improvised show.

325
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,166
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

326
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,041
The show will be great as
long as we work together.

327
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,500
Cater... pillar.

328
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
Cater... pillar.
Cater... pillar.

329
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,791
Cater... pillar.

330
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,583
Turn around. Turn around.
Turn around. Turn around.

331
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,416
They love me!

332
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,500
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, that hurt!

333
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,416
They love him more?!

334
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,541
Caterpillar!

335
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,416
And up!

336
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,625
Yeah!

337
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,375
And finally, it's time for Sora
to take the stage.

338
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,500
Wow!

339
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,708
I'll watch her every
move and figure her out.

340
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,083
What's with her?

341
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,708
We just got on stage and
she's already adlibbing?

342
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
Fine, two can play at that game!

343
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,041
What the heck is that?!

344
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,125
Her adlibbed moves are
getting bigger and better.

345
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,500
What's gotten into her?

346
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,041
I've never seen Sora
like this before.

347
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,250
There's something different
about her this time around.

348
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:46,166
But... what is it? Until now,
whenever I saw Sora perform,

349
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,416
I thought to myself,
"I will beat her."

350
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,041
I thought that no matter
what happened

351
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,791
I'd beat her into the ground.

352
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,916
But watching her today,
I feel... I don't know!

353
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,500
I still want to beat her,
but something's different.

354
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,041
She's amazing!

355
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,125
So that's what she's
really like on stage.

356
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:10,416
Yes! It looks like the Sora who
loves the stage has come back!

357
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,041
Rosetta, you're doing great!

358
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,041
Just kidding!

359
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,791
Here you go!

360
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,000
Rosetta, you're so silly!

361
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,958
Alright May, are you ready?

362
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,666
Ready when you are.

363
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
Now!

364
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,708
Yay!

365
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,416
Yay!

366
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:01,125
What's so great about that move?
I can do that too, you know.

367
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,875
They're smiling!

368
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,416
I get it.

369
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,750
Sora always paid attention to
the audience's reaction.

370
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,541
She has the power to make
all of these people smile.

371
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,833
The importance of a smile...

372
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,375
Hey sis!
You're awesome!

373
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,250
Hey sis, you're the greatest!

374
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,708
Over here!

375
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,875
Now I'm here!

376
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,083
How about this?

377
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
That's awesome, May!

378
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,666
Super!

379
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,041
That's so cool!

380
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,291
What is it... this feeling?

381
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,375
Sorry to disturb you, you're
usually sleeping when I come by.

382
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,041
It's fine.

383
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,625
I just wanna change
your flowers.

384
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,750
So Leon.

385
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,333
I don't mean to pry, but I
wanted to ask you about Sophie.

386
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,250
Is it okay if we talk about her?

387
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,291
Sophie's dead.

388
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,625
She was in an accident, huh?

389
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,833
It's none of your business.

390
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,416
The show at Kenneth Motors
today was pretty amazing,

391
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,750
I wish you could have seen it.

392
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,166
The building was a pyramid,

393
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,958
there was so much light
coming in through the windows

394
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,625
that while I was
flying through the air

395
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,458
I felt like I was dreaming.

396
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,833
It was like my heart was
filled with happiness.

397
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,250
I felt like I could have
flown around the entire world

398
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,958
if I really wanted to.

399
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,750
And now I know what
kind of show I wanna do.

400
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,458
Today was so much fun.

401
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,500
Oh, and May was great,
you would have been proud...

402
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,416
Only a demon can raise an angel.

403
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,375
Thanks to Rosetta, we're
gonna be touring in France!

404
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,750
Yay, I can't wait!

405
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,416
There, we'll meet a
mysterious man who'll tell us

406
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,458
the true nature of
the "Angel's Maneuver."

407
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,416
And he'll mention
her name again...

408
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,125
Who is Sophie anyway,
who who who?!

409
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:22,625
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"Leon's Amazing Past"!

410
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:26,291
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
