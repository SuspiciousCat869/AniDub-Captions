1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,833
Everyone, Kaleido Star is
about to start, so make sure

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,708
that your room is brightly lit
and that you're not sitting

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,291
too close to your TV.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,625
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,750
Do you know what you want
to be when you grow up?

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,708
A school teacher? A doctor?

7
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,541
There are so many choices
it's hard to decide!

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,958
And sometimes, once you decide,

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,791
it can be even harder
to stick with your dream.

10
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,208
But it's really worth it,

11
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,916
so don't ever give up, 'cause
I know you'll do great.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,166
Just keep trying, keep trying!

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,250
'An Amazing Sinister Rumor.'

14
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,458
And now, the moment you've all
been waiting for: my homepage!

15
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,000
It's adorable!

16
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,833
Hold on a sec: you've got a
link on the Kaleido Stage site?

17
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,291
Don't worry. I already asked the
Boss, and he said it was okay.

18
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,791
It's amazing!

19
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,833
There's still a whole lot of
stuff I'd like to do with it

20
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,416
before I'm finished.

21
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,958
So far Anna's the only one I've
got pictures of in the Gallery.

22
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,791
Hey, where did you get those?

23
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,333
I took them. You're really
photogenic when you're trying

24
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,416
to come up with a good gag.

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,250
Are you going to put pictures
of everyone in there?

26
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,541
Well, I was planning on it,
but maybe not...

27
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,000
Why not?

28
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,416
Because lately it seems like
someone different has been

29
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,875
quitting every day.

30
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,791
What?

31
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,125
Didn't you know about this?

32
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,166
Last week, three people
quit at the same time.

33
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,333
It's too much work to put
pictures of people on the site

34
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,833
if I don't know who's
staying and who's going.

35
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,708
So, that's why I've decided I'm
going to my channel energies

36
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,125
and start writing a series
of original stories.

37
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,416
What kind of stories?

38
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,958
Oh, all kinds. Love stories,
horror stories,

39
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
history stories...

40
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,791
How about something funny?

41
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,666
Nope, not interested.

42
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,166
Sora? Someone's here to see you.

43
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,375
Coming!

44
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,916
I think she's someone
you know from Japan.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,125
She's Japanese?
I wonder who it could be?

46
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,833
She said she'd wait
for you in the lobby.

47
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,416
Great. Thanks, Ken!

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,208
I wonder if it's someone from
the rhythmic gymnastics club...

49
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,041
Now, where is...? 

50
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,916
Excuse me...

51
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,875
You sure took your time.

52
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,750
I was starting to
get tired of waiting.

53
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,208
Manami?!

54
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,625
What's wrong?

55
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,958
It doesn't bother you that
I came to visit, does it?

56
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:51,041
No, no. I'm just
surprised to see you here.

57
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,208
I want to catch up, but I'm
sick of standing in this lobby,

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,541
so what do you say
we get some coffee?

59
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,666
I mean, you can get out of here

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
until the evening
performance, right?

61
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,750
And Sora?

62
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,125
I won't be seen in public
with you if you wear that.

63
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,708
Huh? I'm still in costume!
Be right back...

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,500
So, what are you doing
in Cape Mary, Manami?

65
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,041
I'm part of a student-exchange
program, so I'll be studying

66
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,708
in Boston for three months.

67
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,750
Wow. Well, you always
were really good in school.

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,833
You could've been, too,

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,708
if you ever took
the time to study, Sora.

70
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,791
Oh, I don't think
I could ever be as smart

71
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,208
as you are if I tried.

72
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,375
Well, maybe that's because
you wasted your time going

73
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,666
to English conversation school
while everyone who actually

74
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,583
wanted to succeed
went to cram school.

75
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,125
Yeah, I think you've mentioned
that a couple times before.

76
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,333
I know. That's why
I was so surprised today.

77
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,666
Well you know I really

78
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,041
never thought that
I'd see you playing the lead.

79
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,416
When you said you were
coming here to be a star

80
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,708
of Kaleido Stage, I thought
you'd lost your mind.

81
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,833
I never thought you'd
actually pull it off.

82
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, I haven't yet,

83
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,916
I mean, I've still got
a long way to go--

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,375
I was just lucky they needed

85
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,375
a second female lead this
time so Layla and I could--

86
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,666
So that's why.

87
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,500
Do you ever regret it?

88
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,500
Coming here's the
best thing I've ever done.

89
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,875
So I don't regret being here,

90
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,500
but I really would have
regretted staying in Japan.

91
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,291
Is something wrong, Manami?

92
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
What do you mean?

93
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,625
It's like you're having a hard
time deciding what to do.

94
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:31,083
You've always seemed so sure
of yourself, but now...

95
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,750
You can be
really rude sometimes.

96
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't treat me like a moron
just because you're happy.

97
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,416
I didn't mean it
to sound that way, honestly.

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,833
Ugh, stop groveling. Besides,
you have to be getting back.

99
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,875
This time I figured I'd just
wait for you backstage after

100
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,541
you finish with the show, okay?

101
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,375
Oh, you're going
to see the show again?

102
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,916
Of course not.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,458
I'm coming back because I'm
staying in your room tonight.

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,791
I don't have
a hotel reservation.

105
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,375
Oh really...?

106
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,208
And this is where
our dressing rooms are.

107
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,083
Oh no, it wouldn't be
fair to you -- I can't even

108
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,708
hold you in my arms!

109
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,375
Please, it doesn't matter to
me that you're just a ghost.

110
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,208
I don't ever want
to live without you.

111
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,583
What are you guys doing?

112
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,500
Hey, Sora!

113
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,208
Oh and who's our visitor?

114
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,291
This is Manami,
a friend from home.

115
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,333
It's nice to meet you.

116
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,750
Nice to meet you, too.

117
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,000
When you came in we were
acting out one of the stories

118
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,541
Mia has posted on her website.

119
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,041
You want us to give you a part?

120
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,541
What? Me?

121
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,666
Yeah! And I've got the
perfect role for you, too.

122
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,541
What is it?

123
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,750
The mysterious comic crazy-girl.

124
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
The mysterious... what, now?

125
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,625
Aww, that sounds like
the best part...

126
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,291
She'll be perfect!
Good choice, Mia.

127
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,375
Can't I try another part?
My lines are embarrassing...

128
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,875
Oh, teenage girls are going
to think you're adorable.

129
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,500
That's just what I said!

130
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,666
Great show you guys!

131
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,458
Sora, do you have a minute?

132
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,791
Sure.

133
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,416
Did I see you holding
your back at curtain call?

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,708
Uh no, I--

135
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,625
You need to tell me the truth.

136
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,750
If your body's hurting,
I need to know it.

137
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,916
I--

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,750
Look, Sora, it's
perfectly understandable.

139
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,458
Your body isn't as trained as
Layla's is, but you're doing

140
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,416
the same performance she is
day after day and it's bound

141
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,750
to take its toll.

142
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,625
You're right...

143
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,375
So... I was thinking maybe
I could be your trainer.

144
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,541
My trainer?

145
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,250
I-- I mean if you want me to.

146
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,000
I already got permission
from Kalos, just in case.

147
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,333
I figured the first thing
we'd do is look at your diet.

148
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,625
See if you're eating things
that can actually help you.

149
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,541
And then, well, we can
figure out the rest as we go.

150
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,125
That would be great-- if
it's not too much trouble...

151
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,333
Don't be silly,
it's no trouble at all!

152
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,500
I guess it makes sense.

153
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,416
My body's been doing
a lot more lately,

154
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,041
but I haven't changed anything
about my lifestyle...

155
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,416
Hey, did you hear the latest?
Karen's gonna be leaving, too.

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,666
Then I wonder if
the rumors are true...?

157
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,875
They have to be.

158
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,541
There's a headhunter
around here somewhere.

159
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,708
Kaleido Stage won't be able

160
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,291
to survive much longer
if this keeps up.

161
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,375
Whaddaya want?

162
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,041
Sorry. I couldn't
help overhearing...

163
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,333
Personally, I think everyone's
quitting because of you, Sora.

164
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,000
And who could blame them?

165
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,041
I mean, you're totally green and
you're getting all the leads?

166
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,083
Hey, where did Manami go?

167
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,041
I don't know. She wasn't
here when we got off stage.

168
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,208
Hey I just heard a rumor that
people are leaving the cast

169
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,000
because I'm playing
a leading role.

170
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,250
Do you think that's true?

171
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,208
That's totally ridiculous, Sora.

172
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,750
If you heard that
from Julie and Charlotte,

173
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,333
you know you can't take
anything they say seriously.

174
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,666
I know...

175
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,125
There are a lot of rumors
flying around, though.

176
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,083
I heard there was going
to be a new circus company.

177
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,000
Competing against Kaleido Stage?

178
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,708
Not only that,
they're taking our cast!

179
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,166
Oh, whatever.

180
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,750
As long as we have Layla,
Sora and Yuri we'll be fine.

181
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,208
She has so many things
to deal with. Sora?

182
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,916
Oh, Manami, you're still here!

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,833
What, you want me to leave?

184
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,583
Uh? Oh no, of course I don't! 

185
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:37,666
One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two.

186
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,833
Great, now try it more slowly.

187
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,250
I've got to
build up more muscle.

188
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,708
So I can keep up with Layla.

189
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,000
Layla may be stronger on stage,

190
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,875
but is her boyfriend
as cute as yours?

191
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,375
What are you talking about?

192
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,041
Are you talking about Ken,
because he's not my boyfriend.

193
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,375
Not at all!

194
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
Uh... I left that
protein shake I made for you

195
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,541
in the refrigerator.

196
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,916
You're supposed to drink it
right after a workout.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,291
Helps you recover
faster. I'll go get it.

198
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,083
You're the best, Ken, thanks!

199
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,750
I think he was about to cry.

200
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,083
No way...

201
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,750
What a long day. Hey, Manami?
Do you want to take a bath?

202
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,541
Sure. What are you doing?

203
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,416
Uh arm exercises. Sort of
as a cool-down, you know?

204
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,791
But, I haven't
done anything! Yet.

205
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,458
Sora, it looks like it's been

206
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,250
a long time since
you've had your hair cut.

207
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,958
Come to think of it
it has been a while heh.

208
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,333
Then I guess you need me
to cut it for you.

209
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,958
It's funny, I remember when

210
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,583
we were little kids you
always wanted to play salon.

211
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,416
You always made me
be the customer...

212
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
I made you?

213
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,166
I mean 'let me.'

214
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,041
Well, it looks like you've found
the place where you belong,

215
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,583
Kaleido Stage seems
like it's perfect for you.

216
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,291
You know, I've been watching
you all day long, Sora.

217
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,875
When we were at the
restaurant earlier you seemed

218
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,041
to have everything under
control, but I wanted to see

219
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,541
if you were really
as happy as you seemed.

220
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,916
Were you worried
about me, Manami?

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
Not really.

222
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,958
Actually, I I was hoping that
you'd gotten here and realized

223
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,166
you'd made a terrible
mistake with your life.

224
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

225
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,791
Yes. Yes, everything
is going smoothly.

226
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,333
Huh?

227
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,125
After I watch your
show one last time,

228
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,458
I'm catching an evening
flight to Boston. Manami.

229
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,625
Manami...

230
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,541
One, two. One, two. One, two.

231
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,625
Quietly, folks. Like a feather
not like an elephant...

232
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,541
Come on now, give it
your best! One, two...

233
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,458
So, the girl who was here...

234
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,000
She's leaving for Boston
after the show tonight.

235
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,250
She was one of
your friends, right?

236
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,458
Right.

237
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,416
But you always seem
so nervous around her.

238
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,208
Manami can be a
little intimidating...

239
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,375
Miss Sora Naegino!
What makes you think

240
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,333
that you're allowed to
chitchat in my class?!

241
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,875
Do you think you're not going

242
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,666
to be punished just because
you're playing a starring role?

243
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,041
Well, you've got
another thing coming!

244
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,500
Uh Yuri!

245
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,541
Excuse me,
I need to borrow Sora.

246
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,250
If that's all right
with you, of course.

247
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,875
Ah, certainly. You can
have anything you want,

248
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,458
all you have to do is ask.

249
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,625
Thank you, you're too kind.

250
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,916
How exciting! Yuri
wants to talk to me!

251
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,166
I-- I'm so sorry!

252
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,416
Don't be so nervous, Sora.

253
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,208
How could I not be nervous?

254
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm having lunch with
Kaleido Stage's biggest star,

255
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,208
someone I've been admiring
since I was a little kid!

256
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,125
It's good to hear that.

257
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,958
Because I was going to ask
you to come away with me.

258
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,708
What?! What do
you mean by that?

259
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,041
I want you to come
work for me, Sora,

260
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,291
after you quit Kaleido Stage.

261
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,125
What did you just say?

262
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:41,166
I will be withdrawing from
Kalos's company as of today.

263
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,166
I'm going to
create a new circus.

264
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
I want you to be a part of it.

265
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,375
But, Yuri...

266
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,333
You'll be the star of my show.
Not Layla, not anyone else.

267
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,291
You're not serious.

268
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:00,458
You'd never leave the company,
right? You're just testing me.

269
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,500
This isn't just some kind
of trick. Kaleido Stage isn't

270
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,458
the perfect place
you've made it out to be.

271
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,708
You'll find out sooner
or later. Like I did.

272
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,958
I'm not asking you
to decide right now,

273
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,791
but I will need your answer
in the next few days.

274
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,125
We're in trouble.

275
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,458
Twenty-five people turned
in their resignations today.

276
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,666
What should we do
about the shows?

277
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,083
We've got no choice
but to cancel.

278
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,416
I guess you're right

279
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,416
but how can we keep
everyone else from leaving?

280
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,666
I can't believe this...

281
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,041
Sora. It's awful!

282
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,166
All our performances are
canceled indefinitely.

283
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,791
What? Canceled?
I don't believe it...

284
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,791
Twenty-five more people
turned in their notice;

285
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,791
tonight's their
last performance.

286
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,500
Even Yuri and a few of
the directors are leaving.

287
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,958
The company's finished.

288
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,458
It can't be...

289
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,625
I will be withdrawing from
Kalos's company as of today.

290
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,666
I'm going to
create a new circus.

291
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,958
I want you to be a part of it.

292
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,041
So Yuri wasn't just
testing me after all...

293
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,958
I've done it!
I've beaten Kalos!

294
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,041
This could be the last show.

295
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,875
Kaleido Stage...

296
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
is it finished?

297
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,458
I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

298
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,791
Oh don't worry about it.

299
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,708
The audience couldn't
have been happier.

300
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,958
Yuri approached you about
leaving today, didn't he?

301
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,500
Yes.

302
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,791
What did you say?

303
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,166
No.

304
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,458
I see...

305
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,208
Someone also
approached my father

306
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,666
about buying
Kaleido Stage outright.

307
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,958
Supposedly a businessman
from Las Vegas.

308
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,291
I've known for a long time
that Yuri was up to something,

309
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,500
but I didn't know what.

310
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,750
I just I wish he would've
talked to me about this,

311
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,083
then maybe I could've
made him reconsider.

312
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,458
What'll they do with the ship?

313
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,666
It doesn't look like we'll
be using it any time soon.

314
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,000
I know. If only we
hadn't lost so many people.

315
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:23,000
But I guess there'd be no way
to replace Yuri. I have to go.

316
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,666
Good night, Layla.

317
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:39,791
Thanks for everything.
See you around, Kalos.

318
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,541
Are you satisfied?

319
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes. Just seeing that
look on your face has made

320
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,166
all of this worthwhile.

321
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,750
Sora?

322
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,208
I saw you make
a mistake out there.

323
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:10,208
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, you didn't
see the best show today...

324
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:15,083
I... Actually,
I came here to apologize.

325
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,166
I said something really
kind of mean last night,

326
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,625
I said I was hoping you realized
it was a mistake to come here.

327
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,250
If that's what made you
lose your focus today--

328
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,750
Oh, it wasn't that.

329
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,250
I was thinking about something
completely different.

330
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,083
You see, Kaleido Stage is going
through a really rough time

331
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,500
right now.

332
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,250
Performances are going to
be canceled indefinitely.

333
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,625
And just when

334
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,375
I'd gotten my first lead
in a show opposite Layla...

335
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,750
So, is Kaleido Stage
shutting down for good?

336
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,083
I don't know.

337
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,291
If they do close it down,
would you still not have

338
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,750
any regrets about
leaving Japan to come here?

339
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,875
No. I'd still be glad.

340
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,500
Why?

341
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,833
Because I had to come,
Manami, this is my dream.

342
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,500
You know, I always thought you
were dumb... But I envy you.

343
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,666
I always wanted
to be a hairdresser.

344
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,833
Really?

345
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,791
Yeah. But I was always good

346
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,208
in school so my parents expected
me to do something better.

347
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,500
Uh...

348
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,833
That's why I had to
come to the U.S. to study,

349
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,458
I had to get as far away
from Japan as I could.

350
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,875
I know my parents mean well,

351
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,541
but it just got too
stifling after a while.

352
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,791
I think that's wonderful. You'll
be an awesome hairdresser.

353
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,000
You really are dumb.
Things aren't that simple.

354
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,916
I can't disappoint
my family like that.

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,541
Oh. Right...

356
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,208
I can't just do what
I want like you can, Sora.

357
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
Do you even know
why I came here?

358
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,208
I came to see you admit that
you'd made a terrible mistake.

359
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,583
I'll bet you think that's

360
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,125
the most pathetic thing
you've ever heard, right.

361
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,375
No, I think I need
another haircut.

362
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,458
I want to be your salon's
very first customer, Manami.

363
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,958
I'll support you no matter
what kind of career you choose,

364
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,500
but choose one that makes
you happy, all right?

365
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,958
I'm gonna stay at Kaleido
Stage as long as I can.

366
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,166
I can spend my time worrying
about it and hoping it doesn't

367
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,291
close down or I can decide
this is where I wanna be and

368
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,166
I'm gonna make it work. Right?

369
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,333
I guess you're a little

370
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,125
smarter than I gave you
credit for, Sora.

371
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,083
Maybe just a little bit.

372
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
Well, I've gotta go.

373
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,125
It was good seeing you again.

374
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,541
Yeah.

375
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,166
See ya. Oh, and you make sure
to take care of yourself

376
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,583
out here, understood?

377
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,958
Yeah sure.

378
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,875
So what do you think of it,
Boss? Isn't her story good?

379
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:02,333
I knew he'd hate it, Sora!
This is so embarrassing!

380
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,375
No.

381
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,916
You see? He hates it.

382
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,083
But, Boss, we need
a new show to do.

383
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,416
And Mia's script would be the
perfect production for a company

384
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,875
as small as ours is now.

385
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,583
One week.

386
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,666
Have it ready to go in front

387
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,958
of an audience by
a week from today.

388
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:21,875
Yes, sir!

389
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,375
This show's going to be better
than Shakespeare, I know it!

390
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,500
Not only does Mia get
to write our next show,

391
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,750
she has to direct it as well!

392
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,791
Until Yuri stops swooping in and
trying to take our best people,

393
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,833
things are gonna be
pretty weird around here.

394
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,625
Layla thinks Kalos is crazy
for letting us try this,

395
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,083
but I know Mia can do it.

396
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,625
I know it, I know it!

397
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,625
Join us next time for
'Fire It Up! Amazing Mia.'

398
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,416
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
