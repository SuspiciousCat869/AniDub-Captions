1
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,958
Hey everyone, I'm back!

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,083
Kaleido Star's about to start.

3
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,500
You know the drill by now,

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,666
so let's go ahead
and start the show.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,500
Yeah yeah yeah!

6
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,083
Do you think
it's alright if...

7
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,500
if I continue to think
of myself as your dream?

8
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,708
No Sora.

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,708
I'm afraid you cannot
be my dream anymore.

10
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,166
Live your own dream.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,000
You've become my pride and joy.

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,958
Thank you Layla.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,958
I will.

14
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,666
Okay everybody, let's
pick up where we left off.

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,208
"People of our time: the Kaleido
Stage's New Star, Sora Naegino".

16
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,041
So we're recording the
real thing this time?

17
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,083
Please look at the camera, Miss.

18
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,250
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,666
Action!

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,833
Sora, today was your 200th
performance of Swan Lake.

21
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,250
Is it your "Angel's Maneuver"
that's brought you this far?

22
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,875
Yes ma'am.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,041
Cuz the "Angel's Maneuver" is
something that everyone enjoys.

24
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,791
You know, the audience
is like "wow!"

25
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,416
Kaleido Stage fans named
the Layla Hamilton era

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,750
"The Era of Fire", and now
they're calling your era

27
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,958
"The Era of Light".

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,125
Sora.

29
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,125
Did she suddenly
forget how to talk?

30
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,875
Right now, Sora's
second to no one.

31
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,958
Not even Miss Layla.

32
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,750
The "Angel's Maneuver".

33
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,541
An angel is born on stage and...
even our fellow cast mates

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,791
become members of the audience.

35
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,916
It's like the whole
audience becomes one.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,541
It's a maneuver that
brings everyone together.

37
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,625
I hope someday I'll
be able to do it too.

38
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,958
Create a stage that is my own.

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,750
A new constellation is
beginning to shine brightly.

40
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,208
Really?

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,375
The constellation
Aries is rising.

42
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,875
You mean... Rosetta?

43
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,125
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,791
Umm uh, who are you talking to?

45
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,166
No wait, really?!

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,458
Does that mean that
Rosetta's gonna be the lead?

47
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,000
What?

48
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,125
Me?!

49
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,583
What is she mumbling
to herself about?

50
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,500
But, Fool... I'll be the lead?

51
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,375
Umm, what's this about
Rosetta being the lead?

52
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,750
Yuri!

53
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,166
We weren't going
to announce it yet,

54
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,000
but this is a good opportunity.

55
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,333
We might as well.

56
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,833
For Kenneth Corporation's
"Special Stage" we have cast

57
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,375
Rosetta Passel as the lead
to costar with Sora Naegino.

58
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,541
Me?!

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,875
Yes Rosetta.

60
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,875
We're all looking forward
to your performance.

61
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,958
This is Rosetta's
chance to shine.

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,875
No one told me about this!

63
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,208
Miss Passel,

64
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,875
do you have any comments
about your upcoming role?

65
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,583
Well I...

66
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,083
Congratulations Rosetta!

67
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:30,875
Rosetta!

68
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,791
That's awesome!

69
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,791
I love you Rosetta!

70
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,958
Thank you everybody!

71
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,541
I promise to work hard
and do my best!

72
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,541
Thank you.

73
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,458
I promise I will do my best.

74
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,791
That was Rosetta Passel
after the sudden announcement

75
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,625
of her first lead role
with the Kaleido Stage.

76
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,791
It's so sudden.

77
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,791
What am I gonna do?

78
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,666
Mia?

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,541
Is this the script
for the new show?

80
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,083
Oh wow, can I take a peek?

81
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,208
Sure.

82
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,166
Go ahead.

83
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,000
"The Princess Without a Smile".

84
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,250
Great title, Mia!

85
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,500
It's kinda like when
Rosetta first got here,

86
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,916
she never used to smile.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,291
So is the princess
a diabolo master?

88
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
What's with this script, Mia?

89
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,666
Did you decide to write it
in invisible ink this time?

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,250
Of course not, don't be silly,
unfortunately writer's block

91
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,458
hit me and I haven't been
able to write a single page.

92
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,625
What?!

93
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,458
But they've already
announced the show!

94
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,291
Yeah, I know.

95
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
So what are you gonna do?

96
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,583
I don't know, I've got
this vague concept

97
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,083
but I can't seem to
bring it together.

98
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,875
I must have lost my touch.

99
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,291
Don't worry,
I know you can do it.

100
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,083
Have you guys seen Sarah?

101
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,625
I think she's in her room.

102
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,125
Okay, thanks.

103
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,708
Catalyst.

104
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,666
If I could just
find a catalyst.

105
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,500
Hey Sarah, there's
a package here for you.

106
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,333
Thank you.

107
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
I promise I will do my best.

108
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,625
There you go.

109
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,125
It's recorded.

110
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,666
Thank you Fool!

111
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,666
Now you should give
the video a title.

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,166
Like what?

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,916
How about "Kaleido Star: The
Even More Amazing Rosetta"!

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,875
Oh I like the way you think,
thank you Master Fool!

115
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,250
She said "Master Fool"!

116
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,708
How wonderful, so touching.

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,500
I didn't know
that mask came off?!

118
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,833
Master Fool!

119
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,125
I guess I shouldn't
be too surprised.

120
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:40,208
I just love it.

121
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,291
I can't believe this,
take it away!

122
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,875
Just try to calm down!

123
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,375
I'll rip that thing to shreds,
I'll burn it with the garbage,

124
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,708
I'm going to torch it,
torch it, torch it!

125
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,375
That's not the
painting I ordered,

126
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,833
it's some stupid princess
and a court jester!

127
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,375
A princess and
court jester painting?

128
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,333
That's it!

129
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,791
I smell a catalyst!

130
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,625
I don't want
this stupid painting!

131
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,208
Mia, wait up!

132
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,458
What's going on, Ken?

133
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,208
Well, it seems
that Sarah got...

134
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,041
Look at this hideous painting
Sora, they were happy to take

135
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,833
a chunk of money from me,
and then they sent me

136
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,166
this filthy painting!

137
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,041
It's only dirty
because it's old.

138
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,666
Hey, wait just a minute.

139
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,833
Look at the princess.

140
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,916
Doesn't she kind of
look like Rosetta?

141
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,666
He's right, it really
does look like her!

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,708
You know, I bet that's what
Rosetta would look like

143
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,458
if she were a princess.

144
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,875
So, you have a little crush
on Rosetta, Ken?

145
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,833
I never said anything like that!

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
There's someone else
in the painting too.

147
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,125
Yeah.

148
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,250
The guy hiding
behind the curtain.

149
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,958
He looks like the court jester.

150
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,833
Fool!

151
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,916
There's something
fascinating about him, huh?

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,208
Enough chit chat,
throw this monstrosity away!

153
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,541
Sarah, that's crazy!

154
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,291
Wait!

155
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,208
Hold it right there!

156
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,291
I demand you show me
that painting, now!

157
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,541
Welcome back everyone.

158
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,916
We can finally announce
the title of our next show.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,583
The title is "The
Princess and the Fool".

160
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,833
As you may know, the
word "fool" refers to

161
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,083
the royal court
jesters of the past.

162
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,375
They'd be considered
"clowns" today.

163
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,625
As our story begins,

164
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,166
the princess has shut
her heart to the world.

165
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,666
She's in love with
a jester she saw as a child,

166
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,458
but he exists
only in her memory.

167
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,000
The one who finally opens her
heart isn't a court jester,

168
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,875
but a prince who loves her
with all of his heart.

169
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,375
We're going to have three
teams of court jesters.

170
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,166
We'll divide the rest
of the cast later,

171
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,250
but the team leaders will be:
Anna, Leon, and May.

172
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,625
Everyone got that?

173
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,208
I'm kinda surprised Leon
accepted the role of a fool.

174
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,250
Do you think
he'll get any laughs?

175
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,875
And for this show, we will
have a very special guest.

176
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,458
Excuse me, a team
of special guests.

177
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,250
Jonathan and I are really
excited to be working with you.

178
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,583
Oh yeah!

179
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,208
It's about time!

180
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:51,833
That's awesome!

181
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,125
Look at her!

182
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,666
Congratulations Marion!

183
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,958
Good for you!

184
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,375
Thanks you guys!

185
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,875
Listen up everybody.

186
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,916
This show was written with our
leads Rosetta and Sora in mind.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,833
Our director Mia came across a
special object of inspiration

188
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,500
that she'd like
to share with you now.

189
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,250
Okay Mia.

190
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,750
Oh, thank you.

191
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,583
I used this painting
as my inspiration.

192
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,875
You can't really tell
on this computer screen,

193
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,791
but it has the power
to draw you in.

194
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,833
I'd really like all of
you to take a good look

195
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,208
at this painting when
you have a chance.

196
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,500
The mood of this piece is a very
important part of the show.

197
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,708
Pay attention to the
emotion on the princess

198
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,916
and the Fool's faces, and try to
picture the era they lived in.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,958
I'd like you to use the
painting as inspiration while

200
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,291
you're building your characters.

201
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,541
The success of this show
depends on your development

202
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,000
of these characters.

203
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,208
Alright then.

204
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,208
Group rehearsals start
three days from now.

205
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,166
Everybody keep in
mind what Mia said,

206
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,541
and start building
your characters.

207
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,708
You're dismissed.

208
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,041
Yes sir!

209
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,708
All's well to the right.

210
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,208
All's well to the left.

211
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,166
My mission of turning on
the lights is complete.

212
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,083
What's this?

213
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,875
"Training in Progress,
Do Not Disturb".

214
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,000
I guess they're
better performers

215
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,208
than they are spellers.

216
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,833
I want nothing more than
your love, princess!

217
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,333
I don't think you'll ever be
able to get my smile back.

218
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm sorry, but you
can't even juggle.

219
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,625
Well that's why I've summoned
three fools here for you today.

220
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,541
Now, the first fool!

221
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,833
Okay, try to make
the princess smile.

222
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,958
 Hi, I'm the first fool.

223
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,750
Don't get too excited coz I'm
the second and third fool too.

224
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,833
Come on fool, can't you at
least pretend to cooperate?!

225
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,791
I really don't see the point
of a fool playing a fool.

226
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,791
Fool, you can play the
prince... next time.

227
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,208
You lied to me!

228
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,000
That's what you
said the last time!

229
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,083
I never get to play the
prince, I'm always the fool!

230
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,083
Oh man!

231
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,375
Why don't we just
call it a night?

232
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,375
You wanna stop?

233
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,541
Why not?

234
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,333
We don't have any lines
in the real show.

235
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,583
But Mia worked really hard
to write these lines so that

236
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,916
it'd be easier for us
to build our characters.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,541
Rosetta?

238
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,291
Yes?

239
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,666
Don't listen to Sora.

240
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,375
Real performers build their
characters physically.

241
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,875
Yes, Master Fool.

242
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,791
I'll teach you step-by-step.

243
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,125
Just do what I tell
you to do, okay?

244
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,708
Yes Master Fool.

245
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,500
The first step is to run a bath,
and call me once you've got...

246
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,000
Um, don't you think you
were a little hard on him?

247
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,250
No.

248
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,458
In fact I may not have
thrown him far enough.

249
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,666
So anyway, about practice, I...

250
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,750
Are you sure you wanna
stop for the night?

251
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,625
Rehearsal starts in three days.

252
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,583
Don't worry.

253
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,791
I'll be fine.

254
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,458
But Rosetta...

255
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,083
I don't need a lot of time
to build this character.

256
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,291
You don't?!

257
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,875
Why do you say that?

258
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,208
I know the character...
because the story's about me.

259
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,125
I never smiled back when I was
called "The Diabolo Machine".

260
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,000
I know everything about the
princess cuz she's just like me.

261
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,000
Hey Sora!

262
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,458
Will you teach me
the trampoline?

263
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,166
Come on please?

264
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,333
I'd love to teach you.

265
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,166
You will!?

266
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,541
Thank you Sora!

267
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,583
I wanna learn to jump really
really high like you do!

268
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,833
My princess.

269
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:10,791
You again?

270
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,625
How'd you make it back so...

271
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,125
Which would you prefer?

272
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,416
The "Legendary Great Maneuver"
or the "Angel's Maneuver"?

273
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,208
Fool?

274
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,333
What's wrong?

275
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,666
He's acting kinda strange.

276
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,541
And his mask is gone.

277
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,375
Hey Fool...

278
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,250
What's the matter with you?

279
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,791
Is there something
wrong, my Fool?

280
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,708
Princess, I promise I'll get
your smile back for you,

281
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,333
no matter what.

282
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,833
That's why you are my angel.

283
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,000
If I am your angel, princess,
then you are my demon.

284
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,875
I would give my life
just to see you smile.

285
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,375
Fool?

286
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:46,958
Fool?

287
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:47,500
Fool!

288
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,208
Prepare to die!

289
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,541
Fool!

290
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,625
He snapped out of it.

291
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,833
Are you feeling okay?

292
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,416
I'm fine... what just happened?

293
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,791
You were kinda
mumbling to yourself.

294
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,416
Yeah, you were.

295
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,416
Something about
angels and demons...

296
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,166
It can't be...

297
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,625
Up I go!

298
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,458
Up I go!

299
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,291
Meow, meow, meow!

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,875
These bunny costumes
are pretty cool!

301
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:28,666
I like 'em!

302
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,416
Okay, here we go!

303
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,416
Right!

304
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,125
Hold it!

305
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,875
You can't go stealing my moves!

306
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,291
Stay away from me!

307
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,458
What's he doing?

308
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,791
That's kinda scary!

309
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,833
I'm sorry!

310
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,416
This is my hardest role ever.

311
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,375
It was actually pretty funny...

312
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,625
Mia's an absolute genius for
choosing to cast Leon as a fool!

313
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,291
No.

314
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,666
Let's try it again.

315
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,833
You wanna start from
the beginning again?

316
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,041
Let's just try the part where
the princess first smiles

317
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,500
at the prince.

318
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,291
Okay.

319
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,833
Ready, Rosetta?

320
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,000
That's all wrong.

321
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,583
Give it a rest already.

322
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,333
Come on, I know this character
better than anyone else does.

323
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,791
Just calm down, Rosetta.

324
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,500
You're the one who's wrong, Mia.

325
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,833
I'm performing this character
the way I understand her,

326
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,958
just like you said to!

327
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,416
That's enough!

328
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,666
I agree with Mia.

329
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,041
Your performance is
still lacking, Rosetta.

330
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,708
You told me that the princess
reminded you of back when

331
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,541
you were called "The
Diabolo Machine", right?

332
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,166
Well the smile you got back
from doing the "Diabolo Battle"

333
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,041
had more life to it.

334
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,083
But your smile just
now had no passion.

335
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,083
There was no emotion behind it.

336
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,375
Don't be upset.

337
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,791
Come on, let's try it again.

338
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,333
It sounds like you wanna
play the princess, Sora.

339
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,666
May!

340
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,458
I know, I know, you've got
a leading role as well.

341
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,916
But you only perform for a few
minutes at the end of the show.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,166
The rest of the performance
you'll be backstage watching

343
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,000
the jesters do their thing.

344
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,458
May?

345
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,291
Listen Rosetta, if you don't
wanna take this seriously

346
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,958
then you should
just quit right now.

347
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,291
May, Rosetta's doing
the best she can.

348
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,666
You're supposed to be
Rosetta's partner, right?

349
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,916
Well you're only hurting her
by going easy on her.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,875
She's looking to you to guide
her and give her direction.

351
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,583
I'm not going easy on her.

352
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,375
I have no problem critiquing
her, but I don't have to yell!

353
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,541
Rosetta, wait!

354
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,541
I think she's beginning
to realize that this role

355
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,041
could make or break her career.

356
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,541
She's realized that, and she's
feeling pressured because of it.

357
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,625
Taking on a lead role has
been more difficult than

358
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,708
she thought it would be, so
now she's lacking confidence.

359
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,208
She probably feels
like running away.

360
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,083
You'll never understand
what she's going through.

361
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,750
That's not true,
I do understand.

362
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,375
I've been there before.

363
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,708
Yeah right Sora,

364
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,291
the word "pressure"
isn't in your vocabulary!

365
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,666
Well rehearsals like
this aren't gonna help us.

366
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,583
We'll just have to wait and see.

367
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
I don't get it.

368
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,791
What am I doing wrong?

369
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,416
So which one of these lovely
ladies is not wearing a bra?

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,583
Your prize is riding
on your answer.

371
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,750
Fool!

372
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,208
Hey Fool, can you hear me?

373
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,666
I need your help!

374
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,791
Please Fool... where are you?

375
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,291
Hello?

376
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,916
Layla Hamilton speaking.

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,291
Oh hello, Sora!

378
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,750
It's been a while
since we talked.

379
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,958
Um, are you busy right now?

380
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,583
Not at all.

381
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,000
Cathy's revising the script, so
we're not performing right now.

382
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,583
So I heard Rosetta's
the lead this time around.

383
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,083
Makori's working to
prepare for her debut too.

384
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,125
Miss Layla, can
I stop for today?

385
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,125
Don't be ridiculous, you have
20 more reps to do today,

386
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,333
so keep going.

387
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,583
Yes ma'am!

388
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,916
It sounds like you're in
the middle of something.

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,791
It's no big deal.

390
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,250
Is everything okay?

391
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,791
Well I...

392
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,166
Sora...

393
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,500
Everything's fine,

394
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,000
I just wanted to ask if
you're coming to the show?

395
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,875
Of course I am,
I can't wait to see it!

396
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,708
Oh good.

397
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,958
I'll see you there.

398
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:10,583
Take care!

399
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,916
You too.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,083
Buh bye!

401
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,125
Oh man, what am I doing?

402
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,166
I can't bother
Layla about this.

403
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,541
I'll have to
take care of it myself.

404
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,666
Rosetta?

405
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,958
Hey Sora.

406
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,333
Ken told me that
I could find you here.

407
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,083
Look at that.

408
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,041
You noticed him too, huh?

409
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,500
That court jester looks
exactly like Fool, doesn't he?

410
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,083
And the princess
kinda looks like you.

411
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,041
I wonder why
they're painted together.

412
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,125
What's their relationship?

413
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,375
It looks like it's snowing,
so it must be winter time.

414
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,666
Do you think that maybe

415
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,291
he's trying to
entertain the princess?

416
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,916
Sora...

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,625
I'm so sorry!

419
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,875
I'm sorry, Sora!

420
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,250
What's the matter, Rosetta?

421
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,541
I'm not able
to see Fool anymore!

422
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,583
When I was chosen for
the lead I was so happy.

423
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,083
I thought "Now I can be
like Sora and Miss Layla".

424
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,750
I thought I'd be
the next Kaleido Star.

425
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,041
But now I'm so afraid...
my dream won't come true.

426
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,875
Rosetta, please stop crying.

427
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,333
My dream!

428
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,625
I just wanted...

429
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,750
to do the "legendary
Great Maneuver" with you!

430
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,833
Let's go back to the dorm.

431
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,791
Hey Rosetta!

432
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,166
I've made you a treat that
you'll really wanna eat!

433
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,708
May cooked a special
dinner just for you!

434
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,541
I promise my
special Chinese dinner

435
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,250
will wash your worries away!

436
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,583
It's really good!

437
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,291
It's open...

438
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,250
Rosetta?

439
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,416
Are you here?

440
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,083
You don't think...

441
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,875
Surely she wouldn't...

442
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,416
Rosetta ran away?

443
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,625
This is terrible!

444
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,125
Call the police right away!

445
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,083
I'll ask my dad if we can use
his car to search for her.

446
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,500
My theory is that
she's gone to the airport.

447
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,333
That's what she did last time.

448
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,083
What are we gonna do?!

449
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,125
What are we gonna do?!

450
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,791
Somebody please tell me!!

451
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:23,958
Please wait!

452
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:24,958
Wait a second!

453
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,541
Did we get here in time?

454
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,833
Have you seen this little girl?

455
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,250
She ran away and we think
she might be trying

456
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,833
to get a flight to Paris!

457
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,583
She's a cute little girl, you'd
remember her if you saw her!

458
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,583
I'm sorry, but the last flight
to Paris left two hours ago.

459
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,000
There's no way
she could have made it.

460
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,625
Two hours ago we were just
getting back to the dorm.

461
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,000
He says he can find her.

462
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,708
Let's go!

463
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,291
Hey taxi!

464
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
At this rate I'm never gonna
make it to the airport.

465
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,666
None of the cabs will even
stop cuz I'm just a kid.

466
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm so sleepy.

467
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh gross, it's covered
in dust and cobwebs.

468
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,916
There's no way
I'm sleeping here...

469
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,583
But that's...

470
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,333
This is... Fool's!

471
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,666
Fool!

472
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,333
Princess!

473
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,500
I am going to try to
master this maneuver

474
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,500
for the sake of your smile.

475
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,916
My only wish...
is to see your smile.

476
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,291
Two people who wish
for each other's smiles.

477
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,041
Yet were never allowed
to smile at each other.

478
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,083
These are the memories
he sealed away.

479
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,958
Sad memories.

480
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,541
More powerful than any of the
different emotions he felt

481
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,000
as a spirit of the stage.

482
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,208
Sora's.

483
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,625
Miss Layla's.

484
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,666
May's.

485
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,250
Everyone's.

486
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,333
Those feelings...

487
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,125
My feelings...

488
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,791
Why was I trying to run away?

489
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,875
Even if I can't see Fool
I still love the stage.

490
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,083
I wanna perform on the stage
that gave me back my smile.

491
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,083
A stage that will give other
people their smiles back too.

492
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,583
Just like Sora.

493
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,458
I'd almost forgot that feeling.

494
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,833
Yup, there she is!

495
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,250
Rosetta!

496
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,250
Sora!

497
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh thank goodness!

498
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,583
I'm so sorry!

499
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,291
We were all so worried!

500
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,500
See, I told you.

501
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,500
Jonathan has a really good nose.

502
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,208
He's better than a police dog.

503
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,625
So, you're coming back to
the stage with us, right?

504
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,083
Of course.

505
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,041
After all, I'm the only one
who can play the princess!

506
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,458
But... Rosetta...

507
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,458
You see, I almost forgot
something very important.

508
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,833
But I'm okay now.

509
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,666
I know I won't ever
lose sight of it again.

510
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,541
Good.

511
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,500
Someday I'll be a true
Kaleido Star like you.

512
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,958
I'm sure you will.

513
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,625
Welcome back, Rosetta.

514
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,833
Now that's a good smile.

515
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,458
Fool!

516
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,541
You can see him?

517
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,875
Yeah.

518
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,416
Rosetta Passel, you have
been chosen by the stage.

519
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,541
I am the spirit of the stage.

520
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,833
My name is Fool.

521
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,500
All the wishes, emotions,

522
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,291
and dreams that have been
poured onto this stage.

523
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,458
They must exist in everything.

524
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,333
Okay, ready? This is it.

525
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,708
Let's go for it, Sora! 

526
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,708
Rosetta it's just you and me.

527
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,958
Let's go show
them the brilliance

528
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,166
of two true Kaleido Stars!

529
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,916
Thank you, Sora.

530
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,083
What's the matter with you?

531
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,166
Sorry, I must have
spaced out for a second.

532
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,500
Its opening day,
can't you space out later?!

533
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,250
Sora, ten seconds to curtain.

534
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,500
Thanks Ken!

535
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,666
Okay, ready Rosetta?

536
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,791
Yeah!

537
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,708
Gather round o ye fools.

538
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,958
This is the Kaleido Stage.

539
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,166
Where good fortune

540
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,166
comes to those with
wings in their hearts!
