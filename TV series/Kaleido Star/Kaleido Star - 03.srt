1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,791
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,666
so make sure your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,208
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,291
My name is Sora Naegino.
Ever since I was a little girl

5
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,000
it's been my dream
to perform with Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,250
So a few months ago I came
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,666
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,583
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

9
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,000
from doing my best.
There's nothing I can't do

10
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,666
if I try hard enough!

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,291
Well, well, well, wouldn't you
get really depressed if someone

12
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,833
told you that you're the
only one who is not allowed

13
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,333
to do something?

14
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,500
This is one
of those situations.

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:03,041
I wonder what it is that
I can do? I wonder, I wonder.

16
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,375
The Amazing Distant Stage

17
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,291
Anna!

18
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,166
Oh wow Miss Anna,
you're so great!

19
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,291
That was horrible!

20
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,666
I wasn't funny at all!

21
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
Your spin trick is great, Sora.

22
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,208
Really?

23
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Can all Asian people
spin like that?

24
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,958
What? Oh... Well...

25
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,291
No, but I used to do
rhythmic gymnastics...

26
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,333
What? What? What?!

27
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,416
Let me through! Let me through,
I wanna see!

28
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,916
Oh... So, this is it.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,125
The show Layla and others
were practicing is Cinderella.

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,041
That's right. Even all trainees
are supposed to participate

31
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,208
in the show.

32
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,333
All of us?!

33
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,750
Yep. That's right.
So, good luck, everyone.

34
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,750
You just want to wish Sora
luck, isn't that right, Ken?

35
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,250
Oh, well I uh...

36
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,791
Cinderella...

37
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,375
Wow! I need to let my family
know about this quick.

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,875
My dad, mom and grandma are
huge fans of Kaleido Stage.

39
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,875
Since I'm their star of
hope, they'll be ecstatic

40
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,458
when they hear that I'll
be on the stage. So what if

41
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,250
I'm only going to play the
part of a pumpkin! In the end,

42
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,333
I'd guess you're more
the prince type, huh?

43
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,708
No, I'd actually rather
aim for the pumpkin.

44
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,208
Huh?

45
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,916
Oh, you know 'cause my father
is a stand-up comedian....

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,875
Oh, so that's why... Sora,
what about your family?

47
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,458
My family is...

48
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,916
They were not very enthusiastic
about you joining Kaleido Stage.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,250
Is that right?

50
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,416
Yeah, a kind of... By the way,
aren't you hungry?

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,208
Let's hurry and go
to the dining hall.

52
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,958
Your parents, eh?

53
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,125
He's here again.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,375
I'm the spirit of the stage.

55
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,291
Don't speak as if I'm a ghost.

56
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,875
So, what is the difference?

57
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,125
Only those who are selected for
the stage can see and hear me.

58
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,625
I heard ghosts are the same.

59
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,000
Some people can see them and
some people cannot see them.

60
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,458
Ugh... Are you saying that
you do not believe the things

61
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,541
I have telling you?

62
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,166
Yes.

63
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:12,833
Sora...

64
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,416
What's up?

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,583
Do you want to know the reason
I have presented myself to you?

66
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,625
You're trying to drive me mad,

67
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,041
so I'll screw up
you vengeful ghost.

68
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,875
Wrong. You're Incorrect!
I'm searching for someone

69
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,375
who will be able to perform
a great, legendary maneuver.

70
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,416
A great, legendary maneuver?

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,708
That's right. It is
an acrobatic feat that

72
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,833
was performed only once,
a long time ago.

73
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,375
For someone who cannot see me,

74
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,291
the maneuver would be
absolutely impossible.

75
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,875
What kind of maneuver?

76
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,458
I'm not allowed to say.

77
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,958
Why not?

78
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,541
If you're the real chosen
one, you will be possessed by

79
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,125
the fascination of the maneuver
as soon as you hear what it is.

80
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,041
Then, you'll want to force
yourself to perform that stunt.

81
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,875
And despite the fact that your
skills have not yet reached

82
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,916
that level, you would
recklessly attempt it and die.

83
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,333
And die?

84
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,916
Everybody who has tried it
without attaining the

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,541
skill level required failed to
execute the maneuver and died.

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,250
You're lying.

87
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,250
What?!

88
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,791
If what you said
is actually true,

89
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,833
shouldn't you be showing up
at Layla's place and not mine?

90
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,041
But, I said that someone
who cannot see me...

91
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,666
So, as I suspected, you're
trying to sabotage me. Right?

92
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,833
If that were my purpose,
I'd rather sabotage Layla.

93
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,708
She's a much bigger star. Since
my attention is on you though,

94
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,625
perhaps I am speaking the truth.

95
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,375
I hate that
I can't argue with him.

96
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,625
Now, please gather
around everyone!

97
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,166
Everyone, Kalos is
going to announce

98
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,208
which of you will be
cast for Cinderella.

99
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,166
The production of Cinderella
we will be presenting

100
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,166
is a masterpiece that
includes a ballroom dance scene.

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,583
So, I want all of you
to appear on the stage.

102
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,916
Then I will announce the roles.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,083
First, guards for the castle.

104
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:57,791
Albert.

105
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,541
Yes.

106
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,375
Emilio.

107
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,083
Yes.

108
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:00,750
Chris.

109
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,083
Yes.

110
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,708
Those three. That's all.
Girls in the town. Clair.

111
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,541
Yes.

112
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,041
Jean.

113
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,833
Yes.

114
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,666
Prince's attendant, Anna.

115
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,875
Wow! It's perfect. Perfect.

116
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,250
Wow, I can't believe
you're going to get to

117
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,750
perform with Yuri.

118
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
Th...

119
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,166
Hum?

120
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,625
Th... The part
won't have gags...

121
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,458
No, no. No, why would it?

122
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,791
Ugh!

123
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,500
For the role of the fairy
godmother, I'll choose

124
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,833
some of you to practice it
first and I will select someone

125
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,583
from that group.
Even if you are not chosen,

126
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,708
you'll be appearing
in a crowd scene,

127
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,833
so do not let your guard down.

128
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,791
Now, here are the candidates
for the fairy godmother role.

129
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,750
Charlotte.

130
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,625
Yes.

131
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,208
Julie.

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,083
I knew it.

133
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:37,958
Mia.

134
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:39,875
Mia.

135
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:40,916
Yeah!

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
Ah cool, you got
a role you wanted.

137
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,666
Wow, that's so great!
You deserve it, Mia.

138
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,583
Now knock 'em dead
and get that part!

139
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, I'm gonna!

140
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,125
For the crowd in the ballroom
dance scene... Kevin.

141
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:51,833
Yes.

142
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,500
Joseph.

143
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,375
Yes.

144
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,708
Miley.

145
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,958
I wonder... I wonder which
role I'm going to play.

146
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,333
Monica.

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,416
Yes!

148
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,916
That's all.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,041
Huh! He didn't call my name.
I am the only one.

150
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,833
It must be some
kind of mistake.

151
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,500
Maybe, he just forgot
to call your name.

152
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,416
Oh, excuse me, Boss!

153
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,291
What?!

154
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,916
What is my role in Cinderella?

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,833
Well, it seems you
don't have a role.

156
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,250
What?

157
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,333
I don't have... a role?

158
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,291
Oh, come to think of it...

159
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,666
There is a role which

160
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,458
you can start doing as early
as tomorrow if you like.

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,208
Yes, you can be the one who
hands out toys to the children

162
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,458
between each show.

163
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,250
What? Toys?

164
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,625
Can you really
call that "a role"

165
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,333
I don't even get
to go on the stage!

166
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,666
If you don't like it,
then don't do it.

167
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,625
I'll do it!
I'll play that role!

168
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,958
I think your match.

169
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,375
Yeah, It's perfect!

170
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,791
Don't worry about it,
let's practice together.

171
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,916
Yeah, let's.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,791
Mia, Anna...

173
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,375
You don't have any time for
practice with the two of them.

174
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,083
Because starting tomorrow,
your role will be to pass out

175
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,791
Kaleido Stage toys.

176
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:15,083
Okay, everyone, everyone!
Please come and get the script!

177
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,208
Kalos is such a creep!

178
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,041
Okay! I think we have no
choice, but to drop a frog

179
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,166
down his back or shave half
his beard while he's asleep.

180
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,875
Or let's go ahead and
shave a half of his eyebrows

181
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,041
and hair, too.

182
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,708
How about drawing eyes
on his sunglasses?

183
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,208
How about this? We'll the
sunglasses on his eyes instead?

184
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,041
Thank you so much
for caring about me.

185
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,041
But if you're worried about me,
I'm fine. I know both of you

186
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,833
want to hurry up and read the
script. It's really no big deal,

187
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,291
go on back to your rooms.

188
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,125
Okay.

189
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,500
Yeah, I guess.

190
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,750
Telling me that I was a person
chosen for the stage...

191
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,000
it must be some kind of mistake.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,583
I told him I'd do this
dumb job because I was mad,

193
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,416
but everyone else is practicing
for Cinderella, while I'm...

194
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,666
What's this?

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,916
Oh, Layla!

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,541
So, you're the one
handing out those things?

197
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,833
Kalos told me to...

198
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,916
I see.

199
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,750
I was told that there were no
other rules available for me.

200
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,291
You still have a long way to
go -- if that's your attitude.

201
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,500
But...

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,250
Sora! It's almost time!

203
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,166
Three more minutes,
and it will be intermission.

204
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Okay.

205
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,708
I'm sure the Boss has a reason
why he's giving you this role.

206
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,500
You know what, maybe Kalos
just doesn't like me at all.

207
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,291
And look at what happened
with Layla. Now I'm here

208
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,000
passing out toys instead
of performing on stage.

209
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,833
Excuse me, everyone!
Please listen to me!

210
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,208
Everyone, please listen!

211
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,833
I'm asking you guys nicely,
so please listen.

212
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,958
Hey, big fat clown,
outta my way!

213
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,833
I'm so sorry!

214
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,875
Mommy! My ice cream...!

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,875
Sora!

216
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,333
Mr. Policeman.

217
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,166
I'm off duty today.
So, I came to see you.

218
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,291
Is everything OK?
What's wrong?

219
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,000
HEY! You kids listen to what
my friend, Sora has to say!

220
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,208
What? What are all those?!

221
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:19,583
Oh, well... I wasn't
able to hand everything out

222
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,583
during intermission.

223
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,166
After you said that you would do
it, you cannot even fill a role

224
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,083
like handing out toys?!
I should have never made

225
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,583
an exception and let you join
the Kaleido Stage company!

226
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,875
How dare him
talking to me like that!

227
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,000
How does he expect me
to hand out all those toys

228
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,125
in such a short period of time?!

229
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,375
He must be having fun, asking
me to do something impossible.

230
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,041
Layla's up there
on the stage glowing.

231
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,375
And here I am off
the stage glowering...

232
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,500
Hah! Yah!

233
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,208
Sora, why don't
you give it a try?

234
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,625
Hum?

235
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,833
This is the best way to
relieve your stress, you know.

236
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,458
Hi - y...! Oh! Uhhh.

237
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,000
I would rather not....

238
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,708
Sora! Here, here!
You must be beat.

239
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,166
That was pretty rough huh?

240
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,791
Mm, hmm....

241
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,333
Hey, the food tastes
really good today, huh?

242
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:39,083
Yeah. Even the fries
are crispier than usual.

243
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,666
You don't need to
tiptoe around me like that.

244
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,791
Anyway, how was the
practice for Cinderella?

245
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,958
It was tough,
just as I expected.

246
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,541
So, what's the show like?

247
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,166
Well, from what I've seen, for
the last ballroom dance scene,

248
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,458
Layla and Yuri are supposed
to use 6 swings and then leap

249
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,750
from one to another
like they're dancing.

250
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,833
Oh, wow. So, what about
everything else that I missed?

251
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,125
It appears that you have neither
the desire nor motivation

252
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,166
to do anything.

253
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,750
Don't bother
telling me my fortune;

254
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,125
as you see it's a no brainer.

255
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,875
But, you see Sora Naegino
this is also the card

256
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,250
that governs creation. The road
is blocked. If you want what is

257
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:29,041
up along that road, you
have to create your own road.

258
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,208
I have no clue what
you're talking about.

259
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,208
What do you mean by
"my own road?" Oh, yeah!

260
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,875
Is this okay?

261
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,333
Thanks Ken.

262
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,333
Are you really going to
do it in a clown costume?

263
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,583
Yup. If I cannot
appear on the stage,

264
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,958
I should turn the audience seats
into my own special stage.

265
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,458
Turn the audience
seats into your stage?

266
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,125
You bet!

267
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,166
The way you always have
this positive attitude is...

268
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,666
great, you know?

269
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,916
Sheesh, Ken, get going already.

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,833
Oh, sorry!

271
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,250
All right, I'm set!

272
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:32,916
Hello, everyone! Are you
enjoying Kaleido Stage?

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,416
Yeah!

274
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,375
Now, my friends, everyone
who wants a glow light,

275
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,750
gather around!

276
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,041
Hurry up and grab one,
the show is about to begin!

277
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,416
Oh yeah!

278
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,875
One for you. And one
for you. And one for you.

279
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,875
And one for you. And one
for you. And one for you.

280
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,333
And one for you.

281
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:01,208
I did it! I finished handing
everything out today. Hum?

282
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,291
You obviously have
no understanding of what

283
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,250
running a show is all about.

284
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,583
Oh, are you talking
about this costume?

285
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,083
It has nothing to do
with costumes.

286
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,416
Why don't you think
seriously what your role is!

287
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,458
What's wrong?! I don't
understand what you mean.

288
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,000
Sora...

289
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:17,916
What?

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,375
Because of what you did,

291
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,250
the next show was delayed
by more than 10 minutes.

292
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,416
What?

293
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,625
You put on a pretty
flashy performance,

294
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,916
so it took a really long time
to calm down the audience.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,250
Oh...

296
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,708
And... You made the kids
come up to get the lights.

297
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,291
Right? Some kids couldn't find
their way back to their seats

298
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,750
and some of them were in such
a hurry that tripped and fell.

299
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,708
I... I... just.

300
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,333
Sora...

301
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,916
I was only thinking about
getting attention for myself.

302
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,291
All I could think of was
to get people to say that

303
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,958
I was amazing. I wasn't thinking
at all about the progression

304
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:05,458
of the show. I don't blame
Kalos for being mad at me.

305
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,958
Oh, so, it's you.

306
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,333
Uh, Yuri.

307
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,500
I do not really want to see
a clown crying you know.

308
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,541
Even if your own heart is
crying, isn't it the job

309
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,208
of the clown to make
other people happy, Sora?

310
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,666
Sora!

311
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,416
What are you doing
dressed like that, Ken?

312
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,666
I will help you
to hand out the lights.

313
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,375
Thank you.

314
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,458
Ah no, anything for you, Sora.

315
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,500
But I'll be fine,
because I finally understand

316
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,750
what the role that I've been
given is. And I can do it.

317
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,000
Huh?

318
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,916
A clown's job
is making people happy.

319
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,916
Sora, what are you doing?

320
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,666
Mom look!

321
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,458
Uh-uhn?

322
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,875
See that clown over there

323
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,208
it hasn't moved at all
since we came in.

324
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,291
Is she alive?

325
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,625
Hey. It looks funny.
Hey hey you? Are you a doll?

326
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
I can't believe she's
performing in the lobby...

327
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,041
The show has already started.

328
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,625
But I can still play my role

329
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:35,083
to the fullest whether
I am on the stage or not.

330
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,916
Oh, that is the clown
I saw in the lobby.

331
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,333
Mom, she wasn't
a doll after all.

332
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,916
Now, I am here to give
everyone a magic wand!

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,500
Everyone, use your powers to
fill the night sky with stars,

334
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,500
okay?!

335
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,625
Okay!

336
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,041
I don't have
a leading role or anything,

337
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,583
if I can bring everyone just
a little enjoyment in my role

338
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,708
as a supporting character,
then I'm doing my best.

339
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,833
Sora, you did it.

340
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,833
No, I've not finished it yet.

341
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:51,541
I'm starting to understand. All
roles exist for the audience

342
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:59,166
so that we can bring them a
smile. That is Kaleido Stage.

343
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,541
Layla!

344
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,708
Layla!

345
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,125
Layla!

346
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,500
Oh! Hi there... What is it?

347
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,791
Um...

348
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,291
What? Me? You're sure
you want me to do it?

349
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,916
A-An autograph... let me
think... how should I write it?

350
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,791
Here.

351
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,291
Thank you.

352
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,583
No, not at all. I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

353
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,708
Tim, Come, on now!

354
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,125
Okay.

355
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,041
Bye.

356
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,500
Sora, you did a good job.

357
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,208
I signed my first autographed!

358
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,416
It would be nice
if the boy could

359
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,041
cherish your autograph forever.

360
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

361
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,583
Kalos.

362
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,166
Hum?

363
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,458
I wonder what could you possibly
be expecting out of such a girl?

364
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Hum... Hum...
What do you think?

365
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,333
Your autograph is terrible.

366
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,791
What? Really?

367
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,083
First of all, there are
several other things that you

368
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,791
should to practice before
you practice your penmanship.

369
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,375
Wouldn't you agree Sora?

370
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:03,208
Uh... Of course, you're right.
But I feel like I understand now

371
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,333
what you were trying
to tell me earlier, Fool.

372
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,750
Creating my own road means
creating my own role.

373
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,875
And waiting for me
up that road is...

374
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,958
is the smile on the
faces of the audience.

375
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,958
Are you thanking me?

376
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,458
Yeah, I guess so...

377
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,291
Then, keep that
thought in your heart.

378
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,250
And now it's time
for you to go to bed.

379
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:29,208
Hey! What are you doing? Stop
blindfolding me! Let me down.

380
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey, Sora!

381
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,333
How ungrateful!

382
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,458
I don't want any of you
pathetic losers practicing

383
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,833
on the trampoline.

384
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,041
And so, the three of us
have ended up in Mia's role

385
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,875
as the fairy godmother,
but Marion is...

386
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,375
Marion started crying,

387
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,291
and said she doesn't want us
to get up on the trampoline.

388
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,416
I heard that Marion's deceased
mother used to be a member

389
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,791
of the trampoline cast.

390
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,125
Maybe, I'm not supposed
to appear on the stage yet.

391
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,708
Maybe, just maybe,
maybe, maybe...

392
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,041
Next time, on Kaleido Star

393
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,750
"Try hard, and you'll
get an amazing chance."

394
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,666
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
