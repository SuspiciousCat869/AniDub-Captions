1
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,291
We're about to raise
Kaleido Stage's curtain.

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,250
Remember that while you're
watching Kaleido Star,

3
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,083
you should keep
your room brightly lit

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,833
and sit as far from
the TV as you can.

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,541
I finally realized the one
thing I forgot to take care of.

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,958
It's the reason my heart is
pounding and it won't slow down.

7
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,833
I'm not her fellow
troupe member anymore.

8
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,041
Nor am I her partner.

9
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,958
I stand before her as a rival.

10
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,750
I've come back.

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,750
Give me your best shot, Sora!

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,041
My name is Layla.

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:56,125
Layla Hamilton,
the Golden Phoenix!

14
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,250
The competition is on, Sora.

15
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,291
And if you don't like it,
you'd better step down.

16
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,416
You said that you're going to
practice up until opening day.

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,916
That you'll make the true
Kaleido Star a reality.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,333
Well I've been working
just as hard as you have.

19
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,916
And I'm not going to
give up without a fight.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,958
The reason I entrusted my dream
to you is because I thought

21
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,708
you had something I didn't.

22
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,125
After all this time you still
haven't figured that out.

23
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,083
I've worked hard to master
the "Angel's Maneuver".

24
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,458
And I'm ready
to compete with you.

25
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,833
I'm sure you consider me
a worthy opponent.

26
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,958
If you chose to
decline my challenge,

27
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,458
then you're nothing but a loser.

28
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:12,125
If you honestly believe that
you can be a true Kaleido Star,

29
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,708
you'll have to
get through me first.

30
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,291
Sora.

31
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,916
Compete with Layla for a role?

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,833
My blood is racing
just thinking about it.

33
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,208
Why?

34
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,416
Why can't I hold back
my desire to challenge her?

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,166
I like the fire in your eyes.

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,125
I take it you're
up for the fight?

37
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,666
I am.

38
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,083
I'll see you tomorrow.

39
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,583
"A Most Amazing and
Inescapable Showdown."

40
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,583
One, two three.

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,375
Don't you think
it's kind of strange?

42
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,375
Huh?

43
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,625
What do you mean?

44
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,625
Nobody's talking about
the audition tomorrow.

45
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,625
Everyone's business as usual.

46
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,458
It's almost like they don't
care who gets the lead.

47
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,375
Maybe everyone likes
both of them equally.

48
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,958
I mean when you think about it,
it's not our decision.

49
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,583
So there's really nothing we
can but go about our business.

50
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,083
Quit thinking about who
will be playing the lead.

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,041
It's not going to change
your performance.

52
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,625
You have to give your role
everything you've got.

53
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,708
You don't have to tell me that.

54
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,750
I already know.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,083
I know it will be difficult

56
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,458
with the time and
budget we have, but...

57
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,250
This is it Kalos,
it's perfect for the show!

58
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,041
It's your decision.

59
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,583
If you want to do it I'll start
working on it right away.

60
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,250
I'll have to tear
down the old set.

61
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,291
Alright, let's do it.

62
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,750
Awesome!

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,250
But if we're going to do it,
then it has to be perfect.

64
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,208
Don't worry.

65
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,833
Leave it to me, boss.

66
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,291
If I wanna debut as a clown,
I have to master this trick.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,708
How many times has it been?

68
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,333
It seems like a thousand.

69
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,791
She's really putting everything
she's got into this show.

70
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,250
I can do this!

71
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,041
Anna?

72
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,250
Okay that's enough, Anna!

73
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,958
 You're gonna hurt yourself!

74
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,916
I'm okay you guys.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,083
I think I'll get
the hang of it soon.

76
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,791
I think we should stop here.

77
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,583
You need to get plenty of rest.

78
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,083
Yeah.

79
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,041
I thought for sure
you were going to refuse

80
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,583
to compete with her.

81
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,250
Yeah... I guess
that goes against

82
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,916
everything I've stood for.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,708
But I... I can't
hold back my feelings.

84
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,750
Layla's the one who
taught me about the kindness

85
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,875
and the cruelty of the stage.

86
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,666
She was always
so far ahead of me.

87
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,541
She became a goal
that I could strive for.

88
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,958
Now she's come back
to the stage as my rival.

89
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,458
She left the Kaleido Stage
because of a shoulder injury.

90
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,666
It must have been so
painful for her to master

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,708
the "Angel's Maneuver".

92
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,083
She's so strong.

93
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,083
That's why I wanna
compete against her.

94
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,000
To show her I'm strong too.

95
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,208
Layla's very special to me,
she's taught me so much.

96
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
Then I guess meeting Layla

97
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,916
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to you.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,791
Yeah.

99
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,333
Sophie and I... we never
had that kind of luck.

100
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,291
In fact, I was
bad luck for Sophie.

101
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
I was the one who tied her down.

102
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,500
Let all her
potential go to waste.

103
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,250
And in order to atone,
I continued to go on stage.

104
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,000
I destroyed my partners...
in search of a True Star.

105
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,166
I've committed
so many wrongs, Sora.

106
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,625
If a True Star is born,
I can die satisfied.

107
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,041
Leon!

108
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,708
And so Leo turns
its fangs to Sagittarius.

109
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,958
Its brilliance increased
to a ferocious level.

110
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,125
Why did you come all this way?

111
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,750
Are you worried?

112
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,541
Both constellations
shine intensely.

113
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,500
However, their fate
is that if they collide,

114
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
one must disappear.

115
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,625
Is that so?

116
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,375
I thought my constellation
had already disappeared.

117
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,416
I should have known better.

118
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,375
Ever since the day I realized
I could still see you,

119
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,416
I wondered what it meant.

120
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,166
I knew it had
something to do with Sora.

121
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,708
I thought maybe I had
been chosen to guide her.

122
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,083
But in the end,

123
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,541
it was my actions that
caused her to take a detour.

124
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:50,666
Watching Sora regain her
brilliance, I had a realization.

125
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,375
I've never been allowed
to leave this stage behind.

126
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,875
So why shouldn't I return?

127
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,291
Just like May, after
Leon damaged her shoulder.

128
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,416
I can become a demon.

129
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,375
And if I do, it's possible
this demon could destroy

130
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,083
the true Kaleido Star
and all of her dreams.

131
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,208
Tomorrow, we shall see.

132
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,083
What a day!

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,625
I haven't been this
excited in a long time.

134
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,458
I've got butterflies
in my stomach.

135
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,750
It's strange.

136
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
I know it's a competition,

137
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,083
but there's none of the pain
that there was at the festival.

138
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,958
It's the opposite.

139
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,125
I'm happy I can compete.

140
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,291
You'll have to
get through me first.

141
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,541
Sora.

142
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,083
I'll do my best,
and I'll have no regrets.

143
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,833
But... Leon.

144
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
We have an important
audition going on today.

145
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,166
Let's try not to get
in the middle of it.

146
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,666
Now, time to start eating!

147
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,333
But Chinese food
for breakfast is...

148
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,125
You'd better start eating
and gather up your strength,

149
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,833
or she's gonna crush you!

150
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,708
She's gonna what?!

151
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,166
You don't wanna be
a pathetic loser, Sora.

152
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,916
You... think I'll lose?

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,041
That's beside the point.

154
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,833
I'm looking forward to seeing
Layla's "Angel Maneuver"...

155
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,458
but I'm looking forward
to yours as well.

156
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,541
Thank you.

157
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,791
Now hurry up and start chomping,

158
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,583
eat like you've
never eaten before!

159
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,416
You're not eating fast enough!

160
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,291
It's spicy!

161
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,083
Now some of this!

162
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,833
Too hot!

163
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,833
What about this?

164
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,083
It stinks!

165
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,333
The "Angel's Maneuver" requires
innate instinct and skill.

166
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,916
I'm impressed you mastered
it to this degree, Layla.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,125
I had to perfect it,

168
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,083
or this competition
would be meaningless.

169
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,500
I wonder when it was.

170
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,041
What?

171
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,416
The last time that
I felt this feeling.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,333
Maybe it was the first time
I stood on the Kaleido Stage.

173
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,875
Or maybe it was my first
audition for a leading role.

174
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,083
What about the first time you
completed the "Golden Phoenix"?

175
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,875
Those feelings seem
different somehow.

176
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,416
Yuri, my heart is racing; I'm so
excited about today's audition.

177
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
I guess we'll know soon.

178
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,208
Yeah.

179
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,583
So tell me.

180
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,708
Do you really think your
dream of a true Kaleido Star

181
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,625
will become a reality today?

182
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,291
Nobody knows for sure.

183
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,750
Hey Kalos.

184
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,791
What?

185
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,791
I like your socks.

186
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,250
I've always loved
your fashion sense, darling.

187
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,125
Let's go.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,375
This is exciting.

189
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,958
What will happen?

190
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:53,083
Do you think Sora will be able
to fulfill our dreams, Kalos?

191
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,500
I have high hopes for her, sir.

192
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,125
And I've got high hopes
for her as well.

193
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,250
You know, I've been
told there's a door...

194
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,458
that only dreamers can open.

195
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,916
Scene 32.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,583
The Angel's Flight.

197
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,083
It's finally gonna happen!

198
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,416
Yeah.

199
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,791
Leon?

200
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,833
What?

201
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,000
I think you're
wrong about Sophie.

202
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,458
You treasured her
above everything else.

203
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,458
And I'm sure that she felt
the same way about you.

204
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,125
You may not have
had anything else,

205
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,041
but you always had each other.

206
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,208
I think that having someone
to care about is happiness.

207
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,208
I know she was
happy because of you.

208
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,958
And I know that if I were
Sophie, I would never wanna

209
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,541
watch you suffer trying
to make up for the past.

210
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,250
You should be on stage
because you love it,

211
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,625
not because you're
atoning for the past.

212
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,833
If the stage brings you pain,
then you shouldn't go out there.

213
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,416
I'm sure I can do
this audition by myself.

214
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,750
If you're going on stage,
do it for your own sake.

215
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,833
For my own sake?

216
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,833
Let's go out there together and
get the biggest applause we can.

217
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,250
Let's show them
a real "Angel's Maneuver".

218
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,916
The biggest applause?

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,041
On stage with you, Sora?

220
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
I'd like that.

221
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,958
It's about to start.

222
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,750
Yes.

223
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,750
If I keep going straight down,
I should hit trapeze A-2.

224
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,541
I can feel it.

225
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,958
I can tell that I'm lined up
with trapeze A-5.

226
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,416
Yes!

227
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,458
They're both perfect.

228
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,083
On a technical level
they're completely equal.

229
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,500
True.

230
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,750
But, Sora's Odette
is lively and vivacious.

231
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,458
While Layla's Odette projects
an air of innocence.

232
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,000
Layla's so impressive!

233
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,458
To think, after all this time
she still has hidden talents

234
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,500
to show us.

235
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,458
This competition
could go either way.

236
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,083
They're both amazing,
aren't they?

237
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,125
There's so much
tension in the air.

238
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,500
Yeah, I'm kinda having
trouble breathing.

239
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,791
I'm proud of you, Sora.

240
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,583
Coming this far.

241
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,500
But now you have to create your
own path with your own power.

242
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,375
You're the first person

243
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,583
I've ever been able to
compete with on an equal level.

244
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,500
I can feel your
passion for the stage.

245
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:53,416
Back then, I never dreamed
a day like this would come.

246
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,958
The first time I saw you
perform I was so frustrated.

247
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,416
So angry.

248
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,750
But now...

249
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,875
Someday the audience
will come to Kaleido Stage

250
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,166
just to see her perform.

251
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,875
Kalos...

252
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,083
It's just like you said.

253
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,166
Actually, she overcame each
ordeal with more strength

254
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,791
than you'd ever imagined.

255
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,125
She became my partner.

256
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,833
And now, she's my rival.

257
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,666
Sora.

258
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,583
I want nothing more
than to defeat you.

259
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,833
When Layla's on stage,

260
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,458
her energy makes the
air crackle with tension.

261
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:38,708
Her drive to defeat me
makes me even stronger.

262
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,250
I can't lose my focus,
or I'll lose.

263
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,416
I can't afford
to make any mistakes.

264
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,500
My "Angel's Maneuver" will
awaken everyone's angel hearts.

265
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,208
I have to perform
my "Angel's Maneuver"!

266
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,041
Wait a minute,
I just had a great idea.

267
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,708
I'm gonna do a little loopy loo.

268
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,625
I'll follow.

269
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,125
That's not what
was choreographed.

270
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:30,208
The "Angel's Maneuver" will
awaken everyone's angel hearts.

271
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,541
Even my own... angel heart.

272
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:44,083
The people who gave me my angel
heart, all four of my parents,

273
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,666
and even Yume.

274
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,166
Everyone has people who
are important to them.

275
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:54,000
Maybe our angel hearts are
treasures that are given to us

276
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,416
by the people we care about.

277
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,750
Sora has started
ad-libbing her performance.

278
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,208
I can't say that I'm surprised.

279
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,958
Layla is seriously
trying to beat Sora.

280
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,541
She may be performing
the "Angel's Maneuver",

281
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,916
but she's as
relentless as a demon.

282
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,541
The demon that raises an angel.

283
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,125
That was Layla all along.

284
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,916
The one who wants
Sora to surpass.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,791
Or the one who wants
to defeat Sora.

286
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,333
Which façade is the real you?

287
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,958
Or, are they both the real you?

288
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,416
Your performance is so peaceful.

289
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,708
It's hard to believe
you're fighting for a role.

290
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,333
Could it be...?

291
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,333
The performers and the
audience will become one.

292
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,708
You want to perform on that
kind of stage, don't you Leon?

293
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,625
I wonder why... the audience
is suddenly so calm.

294
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,458
What in the world is going on?

295
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,708
There's something strange
about Layla's angel.

296
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,541
I wonder why...

297
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,416
I just remembered
my grandmother.

298
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,750
When I was a little girl,

299
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:31,708
I used to write stories and
then read them to my grandma.

300
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
I remember how she smiled.

301
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,875
She always said she really
enjoyed story-time.

302
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,125
I was just thinking
about when I was a child,

303
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,750
I made a picture book for
a sick friend of mine.

304
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,541
It was horrible, but somehow
it made her feel better.

305
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,000
I wonder why...

306
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,583
For some reason I just thought
about my first diabolo show.

307
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,291
I screwed up a little,
but someone in the front row

308
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,458
clapped for me and told me
that I was amazing.

309
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,791
I remember telling my mother
jokes whenever she cried.

310
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,208
Doing anything
to make her laugh.

311
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,958
She didn't think
they were funny,

312
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,666
but I always got her
to smile again.

313
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,083
I remember asking mama
to teach me how to play

314
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,666
on the trampoline.

315
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,833
Mama... she was so happy.

316
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,458
Why did this just
pop into my head?

317
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,166
It's got nothing to do
with skating or Kaleido Stage.

318
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,541
I remember teaching my little
brothers wrestling moves.

319
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,500
May Wong Devil Headhang!

320
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,333
Once I started skating lessons,

321
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,625
I didn't get to play
with them anymore.

322
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,541
The room... it's so warm...

323
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,958
The audience is
completely tranquil.

324
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,250
Eerily calm.

325
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,833
Is it because of Sora?

326
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,083
I can't remember the
last time I felt this feeling.

327
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,166
I remember.

328
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,500
It was that day.

329
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,291
The day my mother and father
rearranged their busy schedules

330
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,791
to bring me to Kaleido Stage
for the first time.

331
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,166
I was so excited about
everything happening onstage.

332
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,208
That's the feeling
of an audience member.

333
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,791
On the way here I realized

334
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,458
I was looking forward
to Sora's performance.

335
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,166
I want to see her
"Angel's Maneuver".

336
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
An angel.

337
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,541
That was amazing!

338
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,666
Wow!

339
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,166
It seems the decision
has been made, Layla.

340
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,333
Yes, Mr. Kenneth.

341
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:11,500
Sora.

342
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,083
Uh, yes?

343
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,833
They say a true prima has the
ability to turn their costars

344
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,541
into spectators.

345
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,458
While competing, I couldn't
help but watch you.

346
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,041
I became an audience member.

347
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,708
I simply couldn't hold back

348
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,791
my desire to see your
"Angel's Maneuver".

349
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,416
You've become the performer
I could never be.

350
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,583
I'm proud of you, Sora.

351
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,750
Layla I...

352
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,541
Sora, now that you've
arrived at the gates

353
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,958
of true Kaleido Stardom, there's
something I have to say.

354
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,375
Performers will be drawn here
by their admiration of you.

355
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,666
When that happens,

356
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,916
you must always meet
your challengers head on.

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,250
And when your time is up,
you must fight with

358
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,875
all your strength
to accept defeat.

359
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,208
Competing with your challengers
will be a duty of yours.

360
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,500
Don't forget that.

361
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,875
You see, that's the
one thing I forgot to do

362
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,958
before I left this stage.

363
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,500
It's what I hoped
to accomplish today.

364
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,875
I left the stage
without being defeated.

365
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,833
And because of that I never
really felt independent.

366
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,375
Sora, competing with
your challengers will be

367
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,625
another important duty
of yours from now on.

368
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,291
Don't forget that.

369
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,500
Okay.

370
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,000
Congratulations Sora.

371
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,833
Thank you for everything.

372
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,958
The results of the audition
have been decided.

373
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,916
There are only a few days
until opening day,

374
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,916
so everyone start practicing!

375
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,166
Yes sir!

376
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,375
Until your wishes come true,
you're not alone.

377
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,708
I cried a lot.

378
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,166
I laughed a lot.

379
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,875
I was really frustrated.

380
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,333
I was really happy.

381
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,708
We've all felt so many
different emotions.

382
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,041
I'm so glad you've take
this journey with us.

383
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,125
This is what happens when
you chase your dreams!

384
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,375
The final episode
of Kaleido Star,

385
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,958
"To The Amazing Promised Place"!

386
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,750
My wings are my dream,
okay everyone!

387
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,208
And on toward the sky!
