1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,875
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,208
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,375
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV!

4
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,333
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

5
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,708
Everyone expects me to be the

6
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,708
energetic girl that
I was before!

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,708
But that's hard because too many
sad things have happened;

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,083
I almost gave up on my dream,
and I made my friends worry.

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,833
Nobody wants to see
me cry... do they?

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,500
No, they want me to smile!

11
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,291
Oh yeah, smiles!

12
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,416
Not just mine, but everybody's!

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,291
My dream is a Kaleido Stage with

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,875
no competition and
lots of smiles.

15
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,666
I can do it, I can, I can!

16
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,166
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,750
Why won't you even try?

18
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,791
Why do you keep running
away from competition?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,791
You coward!

20
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,125
I think you should take some
time and think how your

21
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,916
refusal to compete just
now has affected May.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,666
Sometimes you can hurt someone
just as much by not fighting.

23
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,625
Maybe what Miss Layla said is
true, maybe I did hurt May.

24
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,125
But even if I did,
I still don't want to

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,500
compete on stage ever again.

26
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,291
My dream is to recreate
the fun Kaleido Stage

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,958
that I saw when I
was a little girl.

28
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,750
And I won't ever give
up on my dream again.

29
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:24,791
Someday, if everyone works
together, we can make it happen!

30
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:28,333
If only I could get
May and Leon to agree.

31
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,750
Leon?

32
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,083
Sophie...I'm so happy.

33
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,083
Leon's eyes have
never looked so kind.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,208
I wonder...who is Sophie?

35
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,166
"An Amazingly
Humiliating Performance."

36
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,833
Sophie.

37
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,500
Partner?

38
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,125
Nobody can be Leon's partner.

39
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,166
Nobody but her.

40
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,833
Sophie must be the
one she was talking about.

41
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,916
So this Sophie person
is the only one

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,708
who could be Leon's partner.

43
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,958
But...why did Leon
call Sora by that name?

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,708
So she is the one after all.

45
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,708
Okay everybody, break a leg!

46
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,875
Thanks a lot Sora.

47
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,416
I hate asking you to do this...

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,875
No, don't worry
about it, it's my job!

49
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,375
Let me know if
you need anything.

50
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,583
Huh?

51
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,625
The one who can become
my partner is...Sora Naegino.

52
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,041
How are you Leon?

53
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,666
It looks like today I'm
gonna be the one scattering

54
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,375
the flower petals
over you and May.

55
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,958
I'll do my best and scatter
them hard...wait a minute,

56
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,000
that sounds kinda
weird, doesn't it?

57
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,250
Well you know what I mean!

58
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,291
Anyway, I hope that you
have a great show today.

59
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,958
See ya!

60
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:05,416
I won the World Festival
and Sora withdrew.

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,833
Now I'm the top star
and she's just a gofer.

62
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,333
Sora ran away from the chance
to compete yesterday too.

63
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,125
I keep winning all
the battles,

64
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,458
but she's always two
steps ahead of me!

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,791
Hey Leon, I wanna
know who Sophie is.

66
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,541
Is it true that
Sophie's the only

67
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,916
one who can become your partner?

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,541
I don't doubt that whoever
she is, she's amazing.

69
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,958
But I'm confident that I can be
even more amazing than Sophie!

70
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,916
I'll prove it to you that
I can do anything

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,416
that Sophie could
do, only better!

72
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,083
I'm the one who can
become your partner, I know it!

73
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,083
The whole world's acknowledged
my talent, so why can't you!

74
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,541
I'll prove it to you,
I'll beat Sora and Sophie!

75
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't.

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,125
But why not?!

77
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,375
If you haven't figured that
out yet, you won't even be

78
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,083
able to beat Sora,
let alone Sophie.

79
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,500
You won't even be able to
beat Sora, let alone Sophie.

80
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,041
What's wrong with me?

81
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,791
What does Sora
have that I don't?

82
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,250
What could it be?

83
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,291
Let's adjust the
timetable everybody.

84
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,291
Plus thirty seconds please.

85
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,791
May's even worse than yesterday.

86
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,875
She looks bored.

87
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,375
She does.

88
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,625
How are you today Leon?

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,791
It looks like today I'm
gonna be the one scattering

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,333
the flower petals
over you and May.

91
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
But, what...Leon!

92
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,625
Come on.

93
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,125
Huh?

94
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,041
Please don't do this Leon.

95
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,750
Release the trapeze immediately.

96
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,458
Yes ma'am.

97
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,125
I'm going back up.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Please, just let me
get off stage!

99
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,500
So you've finally made
it back on stage Sora.

100
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,333
Let's settle this today!

101
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,416
Please stop May!

102
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,958
No, wait!

103
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,625
The audience doesn't
know what's going on.

104
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,500
Okay.

105
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,500
I'll have to perform...for them!

106
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,166
Are you ready to
face me now, Sora?

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,625
Oh my gosh!

108
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,375
I don't know,
but this is awesome!

109
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,750
You won't even be able to
beat Sora, let alone Sophie.

110
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,291
I want to win.

111
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,083
I've got to win!

112
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,958
I have to beat Sora!

113
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,041
May's turning out a
decent performance.

114
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,791
She's so passionate,
it's like she's trying to

115
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,500
take Romeo's love by force!

116
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,791
I've never seen
a Juliet like this!

117
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,250
And Sora's performance
is so energetic that

118
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,458
May's intensity can't
even touch her.

119
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,166
She's got such presence.

120
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,291
You can tell that she
loves being on stage.

121
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm gonna fall!

122
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,375
I can hear it.

123
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,083
I can hear the
audience's applause.

124
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,375
I love it.

125
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
That was the...
the "Angel's Maneuver"

126
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,666
she did at the festival.

127
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,250
Leon's so passionate now.

128
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,541
Leon...

129
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,541
He's being so kind to her.

130
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,041
Is he just acting?

131
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,916
Or...did I lose again?

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Leon, I...I've got
to get back to work.

133
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,708
So would you please finish the
show with May as your Juliet?

134
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,000
Sophie.

135
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,958
No!

136
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,333
Sophie, wait!

137
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,416
Don't leave me!

138
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,208
Leon!

139
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,250
No, Leon!

140
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,958
I've heard that Leon
will have to spend the

141
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,875
next two or three
weeks in hospital.

142
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,416
Thank goodness
he's a lightweight,

143
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,125
or his injuries could have
been much more severe.

144
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,875
So Kaleido Stage is shut
down for about a month?

145
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,791
I hope that's the worst of it.

146
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,208
I'm just glad that Ken
killed the lights quickly.

147
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,166
I mean it would have
been terrible if the audience

148
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,041
had seen Leon hit the ground.

149
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,458
So the Kids Stage
is shut down too?

150
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm afraid so Marion.

151
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,125
That poor audience
saw a performance

152
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,291
that wasn't any fun at all.

153
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,416
It's not your fault Sora.

154
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,083
Even monkeys
can fall outta trees.

155
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,416
Leon was bound
to fall eventually.

156
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,250
Hurry Sora!

157
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,875
It feels so good out here.

158
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,416
Coming!

159
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,250
You're right, it does
feel good doesn't it.

160
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
Told ya!

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,333
May!

162
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,083
I'm sorry, things kinda
got out of control.

163
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,458
Did you visit Leon
in the hospital?

164
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,083
Why should I visit him?

165
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,541
I mean, I'm not even
really Leon's partner yet.

166
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,125
Do you have any
idea who Sophie is?

167
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,375
Um, no I don't.

168
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,125
Sophie's probably the
only person in the

169
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,041
world who can
become Leon's partner.

170
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,041
And for some reason, Leon
sees you and thinks of Sophie.

171
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,000
You're the one he wants
to perform with, not me.

172
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,041
But...but I don't know why!

173
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,333
He knows that my
contract's been terminated,

174
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,541
and I'm not even
allowed on stage.

175
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,291
I guess you just
remind him of her.

176
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,750
She must have been dense too.

177
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,041
I don't think I've ever met
anyone as dense as you.

178
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,375
You've beaten me again,

179
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,791
even though you refuse
to compete with me.

180
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,375
And you didn't
even realize it, did you?

181
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,875
I beat you?

182
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,458
Umm May, I think you've
got that backwards.

183
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,375
You're so dense!

184
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,375
Super dense!

185
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,916
Totally dense!

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,916
Extra special dangerously dense!

187
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,375
Despite that, I'll admit that
even though I don't know

188
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,125
what it is, you've got
something special that I don't.

189
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,750
So I've decided to try my best
to be a little more humble.

190
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,458
I'll be so humble that I'll
finally beat you, and I'll watch

191
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,291
you squirm while I
become a Kaleido Star!

192
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,291
See ya.

193
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,375
Yeah, see ya.

194
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,333
What was so humble about that?

195
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,041
All of the insurance
procedures and the

196
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,416
related issues are
going smoothly.

197
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,791
Good.

198
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,958
Yes, come in?

199
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,500
We've been expecting
you Mr. Kenneth.

200
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,958
The Kaleido Stage
has been shut down?

201
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,583
So tell me, is this part
of your plan, Kalos?

202
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,750
No sir.

203
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,416
Part of your plan?

204
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
And who are you, boy?

205
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,666
My name is Ken Robbins, sir.

206
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,166
And Sora, how is she doing?

207
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,750
She's depressed.

208
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:54,166
For some reason, she feels that
she's partly to blame for Leon.

209
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,875
You can't open the doors again
until this gets worked out.

210
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,333
That's right, sir.

211
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
We thought that they
would make a good pair,

212
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,458
but maybe they're
not fit to be partners.

213
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,416
We shouldn't write
them off yet sir.

214
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,791
It's possible that what
happened today could

215
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,416
trigger something
in both of them.

216
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,333
I guess you're right Kalos.

217
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,666
I'll just wait a little longer
and see how things play out.

218
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,000
Only time will tell
if Leon Oswald

219
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,833
has the ability to be
Sora's partner.

220
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,625
They're questioning
Leon and not Sora?

221
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,166
If Sora and Leon can
work out their problems

222
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,791
and become partners,
I believe that

223
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,250
Kaleido Stage will flourish,
and Sora along with it.

224
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,458
You can look forward to it.

225
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,541
What are they trying
to make Sora do?

226
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,250
You know, I wonder if
Miss Layla and Miss Cathy

227
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,458
are planning on going
back to Broadway?

228
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,083
The shows have like all
been cancelled, you know?

229
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,916
But I totally think they wanna
stay at Kaleido Stage forever.

230
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,833
Like, is someone coming?

231
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,708
That Sora's got some talent,
don't you think so Layla?

232
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,166
It just seems like she's growing
into this great performer,

233
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,791
but none of the people
around her seem to notice it.

234
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,708
Well, I may very well
be one of those people.

235
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,333
What do you mean?

236
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,541
I think I might have made
a huge mistake with Sora.

237
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,708
She is this innocent and sincere
girl who loves Kaleido Stage.

238
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,541
She jumped into
all of this alone,

239
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,458
with nothing but
aspirations in her heart.

240
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,208
I entrusted Sora with my dream.

241
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,458
I wanted her
to reach that

242
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,166
faraway place
that I never could.

243
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,166
I thought that no
matter how cruel the

244
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,583
path may be Sora could succeed.

245
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:39,333
After all, it's the only path I
know to become a Kaleido Star.

246
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,541
But maybe I shouldn't have
expected such ruthlessness

247
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,375
from such a
sweet girl like Sora.

248
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,208
And then on the other side of
the spectrum, you've got May.

249
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,375
I'm just wondering
what you think,

250
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,333
'cuz I think I've
got her figured out.

251
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,625
You do?

252
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,708
Yeah, think about it;
she doesn't have anyone

253
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,583
to look up to,
so she gets frustrated,

254
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,208
and then she takes
it out on Sora and Leon.

255
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,583
She needs someone to
set goals for her and to be

256
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,750
a mentor to help
draw out her talent.

257
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,416
She just doesn't have
anyone to do that for her.

258
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,083
If she truly needs a goal,
then her best bet would be

259
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,333
to think of the potential
that her future holds.

260
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,666
That's always
been my personal goal.

261
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,791
That works for you
but not everyone's

262
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,791
as strong as you are, Layla.

263
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,166
Miss Layla!

264
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,916
You have a guest!

265
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm sorry to interrupt you Miss
Layla, but you've got a guest.

266
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,041
Umm, Miss Layla?

267
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,583
I've come here to ask
you a special favor.

268
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,291
I know you've retired from
Kaleido Stage, and I probably

269
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,291
shouldn't be asking
this favor of you, but...

270
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,291
Please Miss Layla,
I want you to train me!

271
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,125
I just...I really want to

272
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,416
figure out what
Sora's got that I don't.

273
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,166
And I really want
to improve my skills.

274
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,833
So please Miss Layla,
will you help me?

275
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,125
I think we should help her.

276
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,250
We've got nothing better to do.

277
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,375
That's true.

278
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,000
I guess I'll do it.

279
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,750
Thank you very much!

280
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,375
It's such a beautiful
day today that I thought

281
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,500
it would be nice to
have our tea outside.

282
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,083
Great idea!

283
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,416
But don't you think we should
invite Mia and Anna to join us?

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,916
Well everyone's busy
doing other things since

285
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,875
we've got this sudden vacation.

286
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,291
Oh.

287
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,875
I just wanted to tell you
that you were really

288
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,416
great up on stage yesterday.

289
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,666
Even Mia and the
others were amazed.

290
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
To tell you the truth Rosetta,

291
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,750
somewhere along the
way I started having fun.

292
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,416
Yeah, I could tell!

293
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,958
I think that the backstage
job is a lot of fun,

294
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,250
but I also think that the
stage is where I really belong.

295
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,625
Yeah, I think so too!

296
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,208
When I heard the
audience's applause,

297
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,458
it made me so happy... that I
didn't even feel upset anymore.

298
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,208
I felt like the audience was
sending me positive energy.

299
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,000
The move you did yesterday was
the "Angel's Maneuver", right?

300
00:17:59,083 --> 00:17:59,833
Yeah.

301
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,083
Is it hard to do?

302
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,708
Yeah, I guess it is.

303
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,666
So which part's the hardest?

304
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,333
Hmm, the hardest part of the
"Angel's Maneuver"...well,

305
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,625
it's like you're flying
through the air,

306
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,208
WHOOSH, and while you're up

307
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,458
there your partner looks so far
away, but you have to get close,

308
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,625
'cuz you have to grab hands,
then he catches you SHOOM,

309
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,166
then you swing SHOOM, so,
did that make any sense?

310
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,833
Nope, not at all.

311
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
That figures.

312
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,291
It sounds like
a really hard stunt.

313
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,833
It is, especially since I don't
know enough of the basics.

314
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,083
I gave Yuri a tough time while
he was teaching it to me.

315
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,291
Hey, then why don't we start
working on our basics together?

316
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,791
No, it's getting late.

317
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,041
Let's take a bath together
and smooch while she stays...

318
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,916
It's still the afternoon!!

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,083
You are so mean to me!

320
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,291
Is it bad to do basics in
the afternoon, Sora?

321
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,541
Oh no Rosetta, I was
just talking to myself.

322
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,583
No May.

323
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,041
Try it again.

324
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,666
Okay.

325
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,458
I'm not buying it!

326
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,250
May, at this point we'll
go for any emotion.

327
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,541
Okay.

328
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,750
No good.

329
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,625
Look, your audience is Cathy
right now, do you understand?

330
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,166
Yes ma'am.

331
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,416
Then continue.

332
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,833
Alright.

333
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,583
No good.

334
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,791
No good.

335
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,041
Eugh, no no good!

336
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,375
I overslept!

337
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,916
A ticket to the Kids Stage?

338
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,958
Welcome!

339
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,375
Ken, why are you
dressed like that?

340
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,958
And when did you learn
how to ride a unicycle?

341
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,041
Well I originally wanted to be
part of the cast, you know?

342
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,291
But I had to quit because
I got a weak heart.

343
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,750
But that's beside the point.

344
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,000
Now I welcome you
to the special show

345
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,916
that we've created
just for you Sora!

346
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,166
Welcome to the Special Stage!

347
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,458
We realized you've never
had the chance to sit back

348
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,000
and just enjoy a
show since you've

349
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,666
come to join us on
the Kaleido Stage,

350
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,208
Sora.

351
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,500
So we've prepared a special show
for you, our special guest.

352
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,583
I hope you like it.

353
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,166
It was tough
keeping it a secret!

354
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,541
Sit back, relax,

355
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,083
and enjoy this special show
we've prepared for you!

356
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:45,333
And now, on to the Special
Show for our dear Sora.

357
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,541
Let's go!

358
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,416
Oh wow!

359
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,500
Wow, Rosetta,
Marion, that's awesome!

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,208
Ta da!

361
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,583
Jonathan, you're so good!

362
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,666
Oh yeah!

363
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,708
Wow, how cool!

364
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,208
One...and two!

365
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,833
Wow!

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,125
That's it Anna, you've got it!

367
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,166
Anna you're a natural!

368
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,500
She's laughing,
it's now or never.

369
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,375
Oh, I tea!

370
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,541
Sorry.

371
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,791
Yay!

372
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,625
I have such incredible friends.

373
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,875
They did this just
to cheer me up!

374
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,500
We love...Sora!

375
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,875
My friends and the audience are
what gives me my strength.

376
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,083
With their support,
I could even become a star.

377
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,666
A real Kaleido Star!

378
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm ready to go back on
stage with my friends.

379
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,791
I wanna give
it all I've got,

380
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,416
and perform for the
audiences that I love!

381
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,416
I wanna create a fun show that
we can all enjoy...together.

382
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:32,041
The Kaleido Stage
should always be fun like this.

383
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,666
I love it!

384
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,125
It seems that Sagittarius was

385
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,458
finally able to regain
its brilliance.

386
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,791
However, a shooting
star is approaching,

387
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,625
and is aspiring for
the same brilliance.

388
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,916
This star...whose
star could this be?

389
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:05,708
The Perfect Dating Manual: 100
Ways to Captivate Her Heart!

390
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,708
Ken's invited me out to lunch!

391
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,083
Hang in there Ken.

392
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,041
Yeah, show us what
kinda man you are!

393
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,541
It's time to be brave, brave!

394
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,416
That's right, you take the lead
Ken, right Mr. Policeman?

395
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,958
What?

396
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:17,916
What!

397
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,958
Next time on Kaleido Star: "Mr.
Policeman's Amazing Proposal."

398
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,083
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
