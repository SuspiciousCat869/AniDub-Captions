1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,500
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,333
so make sure your room is
brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,666
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,750
My name is Sora Naegino.

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,958
Ever since I was a little
girl it's been my dream

6
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,458
to perform with Kaleido Stage.
So a few months ago I came

7
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,291
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

8
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,708
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,583
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

10
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,750
from doing my best.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,541
There's nothing I
can't do if I work hard!

12
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,083
Well, well, well, have you
ever met someone who seems

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,416
kind of unhappy all the time?
Rosetta seems like that to me...

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,791
But she's really amazing at
diabolo, and it looks like

15
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm gonna have a chance
to perform with her.

16
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,833
The trouble is, I've never
done diabolo before.

17
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,541
Oh, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

18
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,500
Jonathan, come here! This way!

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Wow, so this is his tank?

20
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,875
Kalos gave me instructions

21
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,250
about where it could be and
what it would look like.

22
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,125
And it looks like
Jonathan's really enjoying

23
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,166
what we came up with.

24
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,208
It's amazing!

25
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,125
It's so big.

26
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,375
Looks like he's
enjoying himself out there.

27
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,000
Jonathan! Come here!

28
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,875
Jonathan!

29
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,708
He snubbed us.

30
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,000
The ingrate.

31
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,500
I guess things'll be
different now that he's

32
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,458
not living in my bathtub.

33
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,958
Marion, Vince has come back
from the market already.

34
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,166
Did ya hear that?
It's lunchtime!

35
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,541
Vince! Hurry up,
he's really hungry!

36
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,833
That girl...

37
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,208
'The Amazing Girl
Who Doesn't Smile.'

38
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,791
Okay, Rosetta, your provisional
contract is for one week.

39
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,750
After I see you perform,
I'll make the decision

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,541
whether to keep you
on here or not.

41
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,875
I hope you understand: this is
our standard business practice.

42
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,166
Who is she?

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,583
Don't you know? She's that
diabolo prodigy from France.

44
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,958
She's great, a total genius!

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,250
She's sort of a hero of mine...

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,833
Sora?

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,666
What're you doing?

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,500
Uh, we were just
passing by and we tripped.

49
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,708
We weren't eavesdropping
or anything--

50
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,083
Just stop.

51
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,166
Sora, Kalos wants you.

52
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
But what for?

53
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,041
He wants you to take care
of a special guest

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,250
we'll have staying
with us this week.

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,208
Really?!

56
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,583
This is Sora Naegino.
She'll take you to your room

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,583
so you can get some rest
after your long trip.

58
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,375
That's right, I'm Sora.
Nice to meet you.

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,625
Well, I'll see you later, then.

60
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,916
I look forward to it.

61
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,291
This is so exciting! I'm
a huge fan of yours. I--

62
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,166
Nice to meet you.

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,333
I'm Mia.

64
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,541
And I'm Anna.

65
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,916
Nice to meet you.
Is Layla Hamilton here?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,208
Oh, she won't be here
until closer to show time.

67
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,750
Oh. Right.

68
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,125
Your luggage has already
been taken to your room.

69
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,916
I'll take you to your room,
okay? Right this way, Rosetta.

70
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,041
Um, Boss? Thank you for building
that pool for Jonathan.

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,708
He seems to really like it!

72
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,833
So this is where you'll
be staying, Rosetta!

73
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,333
The sea breeze is really nice,

74
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,416
so I'll just leave
a window open...

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,250
Sora?

76
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,416
Yes?

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,250
Am I to understand
that Kalos has put me

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,416
in the same kind of room
he gives to his students?

79
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,625
Huh?

80
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,625
I'm the youngest diabolo
world-champion ever,

81
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,916
and I've won that title for
the past four years running.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
I know! I watched
your competitions on TV.

83
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,291
You were really incredible!

84
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,958
And I remember when
they interviewed you--

85
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,375
you were so poised even
though you were so young.

86
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
That's why I remembered
what you said.

87
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,458
You're French-born, you've been
doing diabolo since you could

88
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,750
walk and you travel from circus
to circus all by yourself!

89
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm Belgian.

90
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,250
What?

91
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,291
I was born in Belgium and
I started studying in France.

92
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,166
How are you supposed to be
my caretaker when you

93
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,291
know nothing about me?

94
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,208
Oh. You must be tired.

95
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,833
So how was it, Sora?

96
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,833
Kaleido Stage is proud
to present Rosetta,

97
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,500
the youngest person
ever to hold the title

98
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,500
of diabolo world-champion.

99
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you feel like practicing
for the championship yourself,

100
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,291
stop by our gift shop and
pick up your own diabolo set...

101
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,500
Uh, Rosetta?

102
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,958
We were just wondering...

103
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,791
...if you would
maybe teach us diabolo?

104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,208
According to my contract,
I don't perform unless

105
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,041
I'm on stage in front of an
audience. Please shut the door

106
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,166
behind you, otherwise
I can't concentrate.

107
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,541
Right. Sorry.
What a spoiled brat.

108
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,291
I just wanted
to learn diabolo...

109
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,000
She's amazing.

110
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,541
She's a genius.

111
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:28,416
She is amazing. But why-- why
isn't she more fun to watch?

112
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,958
Watching her is like
watching a diabolo machine.

113
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,750
Mama! I'm bored!

114
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,458
I know, but there'll be
a clown on stage after this.

115
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,416
And now it's time
for intermission, folks!

116
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,208
Rosetta, welcome
to Kaleido Stage.

117
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,375
Oh Layla, how was
my performance on stage?

118
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,083
It was absolutely perfect.

119
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,000
Not a single mistake.

120
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,625
That means a lot to me, Layla.

121
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,583
I'm going to enjoy
watching you this week.

122
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm gonna be around
a lot longer than that.

123
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,083
You sound really sure of that.

124
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,583
I am.

125
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,166
Rosetta. I'd like to talk
to you, do you have a minute?

126
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,458
Oh, you wanna extend
my contract, right?

127
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,666
Actually, I was going to
terminate your contract.

128
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,458
You want me to do a
routine that's more geared

129
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,291
toward little kids?

130
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,583
I'm going to pay you
for the rest of this week,

131
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,791
but I don't want to
see you on stage again.

132
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,833
Let's go everyone,
the show's about to start.

133
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,791
I will want to hear
your explanation for this

134
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,500
in my dressing room.

135
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,125
I'll be right back.

136
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
Sora! We're about to go on!

137
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,291
Rosetta, it goes without
saying that you're

138
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,416
very skilled at diabolo.

139
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,291
That's why I invited you.
But I watched the audience

140
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,500
while you were on stage
performing today.

141
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,750
And I didn't see a single person
who was enjoying your show.

142
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,708
Then I'll just
rearrange my routine

143
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,708
to make it more interesting.

144
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,833
Rosetta, I'm sorry, but--

145
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:11,500
I didn't make a single mistake!
It was a perfect performance.

146
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,000
It's not my fault if your
audience is too stupid

147
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,000
to appreciate what I do.

148
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,666
I see, so you're blaming
this on the audience?

149
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,291
You're right and
they're wrong, is that it?

150
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,583
I've been the world champion
for four consecutive years.

151
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,083
I'm better at this
than anyone else.

152
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,166
Kaleido Stage can only
stay alive as long as

153
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,083
the audience keeps coming back.
And I got the feeling that

154
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,250
they wouldn't come
back to see you.

155
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,375
That's stupid!
Why wouldn't they?

156
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,583
Because this is not
an athletics competition

157
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
where you show off your skills.

158
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
Excuse me...

159
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,041
I'll explain all of this
to your booking agent.

160
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
Ken, when you have time
you should take Rosetta

161
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,041
over to Marine Park...

162
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,250
But, Boss...

163
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,375
Don't treat me
like I'm a child!

164
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,666
Rosetta!

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,666
Watch out!

166
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,083
What's going on?

167
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,875
What's her problem?

168
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,125
She sure can run fast.

169
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,791
But, Boss, are you sure
you don't want to give her

170
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,375
another chance before
you send her away.

171
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,375
I'm sure.
She's not a performer.

172
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,958
But she only did one show...

173
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,875
One show is enough sometimes.

174
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,083
She needs a second chance.

175
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,416
She can do better
if you just let her try.

176
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,875
I'll give Rosetta another
shot on one condition.

177
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,500
Yes? What is it?

178
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,333
You do the show with her.

179
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,875
What's that?

180
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm giving you six days
to turn her around.

181
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,083
In that time you need
to use your talent to make her

182
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,250
act worth watching.

183
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,416
But-- I didn't mean--

184
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,083
Six days.

185
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,000
But-- Boss, wait!

186
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:59,250
Uh I've never done diabolo
before in my life.

187
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,333
This could be good for you.
A turning point in your career.

188
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,250
But I've been performing
without any mistakes!

189
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,958
It was enough to be perfect
when you were little.

190
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,958
Now that you're older,
people expect more of you.

191
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,916
The job offers aren't coming in
like they used to, you know.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,791
You need to stay there.
See what you can learn.

193
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,291
But I didn't do
anything wrong...

194
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,666
Are you all right, Sora?

195
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,875
Not at all.

196
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,791
Why don't you just
tell him you can't?

197
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,583
Yeah. I'm sure
he'll understand.

198
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,083
But I've got to try!

199
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,791
Of course you do.

200
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh no, Miss Sarah, we've
got a problem! Come quick!

201
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,375
What's going on?

202
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,291
Rosetta's gone missing!

203
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,708
That is a problem.

204
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,125
Do you think she
could've left for home?

205
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,625
What, at this hour?

206
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,708
Rosetta! Rosetta!

207
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:58,458
Rosetta! Oh no, where could
she be?! Rosetta! Rosetta!

208
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,958
Sora! I found her!

209
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,250
What?

210
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,375
Oh. I'm so glad!

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,791
What was Kalos thinking,
pairing me with you?

212
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,458
You think that you can do this?

213
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,708
Well, I'll never find out
unless I try, will I?

214
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,208
You know, it's weird, but
when I get all worried about

215
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,708
making mistakes I end up
having a worse performance

216
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,208
than if I just let
myself have some fun.

217
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,875
I don't go on stage to make
mistakes. What's the point

218
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,375
of doing it if you
can't do it flawlessly?

219
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,458
There's no way I'll ever be
as good as you are,

220
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,125
so the least I can do
is be entertaining.

221
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,625
I mean, I can't be perfect, so
I'll just have to do my best.

222
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,708
Working hard?

223
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,041
Ken!

224
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,875
I brought you these just
in case you needed extras.

225
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,833
Wow. Where did you
get all those?

226
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,875
I stocked up on
them a while ago.

227
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,916
I was wondering what
I'd do with all these.

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,916
So this is my fault?

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,375
Sorry. I didn't
mean it like that.

230
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,000
The audience didn't
enjoy my show, so I'm out.

231
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:07,875
I get it, all right?

232
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,958
But, Rosetta, I didn't mean...

233
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,250
I don't know if we can do this.

234
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,291
If you can't
it's not your fault.

235
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,625
What?

236
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,416
You know she was just nine
years old when she won

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,125
her first world-championship?
And she was just five when

238
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,583
she started studying diabolo.

239
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,375
I don't know about you,
but when I was five,

240
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:28,041
I was crazy about Kaleido Stage.
I couldn't get enough of it.

241
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,583
I was, too.

242
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,750
I don't think Rosetta's ever
had the chance to appreciate it

243
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,500
as a member of the audience.

244
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,625
Ken! I think I've got an idea...

245
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,250
The airport, please.

246
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,791
She's leaving!

247
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,166
Okay.

248
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,541
Ken?

249
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,708
'You don't have to be perfect if
you do your best?' Why bother?

250
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,125
Hmm. Uh, Miss? Do you know
those people on the bike?

251
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
They've been following us
for quite a while.

252
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,958
What do you want?

253
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,333
Sora wanted you to see
her show before you leave.

254
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,708
Do I have to?

255
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,291
Sure do.

256
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,791
Go, Jonathan!

257
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,083
Catch!

258
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,750
What's going on here?!

259
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,583
You've got his fish!

260
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,458
Good job, Jonathan!

261
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:09,500
I'll trade you! Oh, no.
I can't reach it, Jonathan!

262
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,916
That was great!

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
Yay Jonathan!

264
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,041
Rosetta! You're just in time.

265
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,583
I can't stay for long.

266
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,541
Come watch Rosetta!

267
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
Just jump in!

268
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,583
Got it!

269
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,541
Aw, give Sora a break!

270
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,583
Jonathan's better than she is.

271
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,833
Jonathan!

272
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,500
You give that back!
Jonathan! Come back here!

273
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,875
Give that back! Come back!

274
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,791
Give it! Hey, look!

275
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,583
Ta da, yay!

276
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,166
You're incredible, Sora!

277
00:15:59,208 --> 00:15:59,916
Weird, isn't it?

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,416
What is?

279
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,625
When I watch her perform
I get really nervous

280
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,000
she'll make a mistake. I'm
always on the edge of my seat.

281
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,291
It's always so exciting to
watch her because she does make

282
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,000
a lot of mistakes, but every
once in a while she pulls off

283
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,791
a trick and it's
unbelievable, like magic.

284
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,083
You should go watch her
tonight, see what you think.

285
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,250
Watch Sora perform?

286
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,708
Here!

287
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,625
It's amazing. Nothing like
the performances I give.

288
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,833
Sora...

289
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,333
Sora?

290
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,500
Rosetta! You came
to see the show!

291
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:09,458
I want to perform diabolo with
you if you're still interested.

292
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,166
I'd like that.

293
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,791
You can do your act perfectly
and I'll just have to

294
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:22,000
try my best. So whaddya
think about that, huh?

295
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,250
That's gonna be one
interesting routine.

296
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,500
But it's never gonna work
unless Sora gets a little bit

297
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,875
more comfortable doing diabolo.

298
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,416
Let's just get started.

299
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,000
Wrong!

300
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,166
Okay!

301
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,541
Do it like you're
going at the diabolo.

302
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,375
Don't actually collide with it.

303
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,375
Right...

304
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
The Devil in its
upright position.

305
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,875
It means she'll have to
make extraordinary efforts.

306
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,916
That was awful. Again.

307
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,375
And she's not even here

308
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,166
to appreciate the
readings I do for her...

309
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,708
This-- this-- this
is totally impossible!

310
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,083
We only have one day left
until our performance.

311
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,000
This is no time to lie around.

312
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,208
It looks like
they've made the deadline.

313
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,541
Building the set on such
short notice wasn't easy.

314
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,875
Sorry about that.

315
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,208
Well it is an
interesting idea.

316
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,791
Did they come up
with this on their own?

317
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,625
Yeah.

318
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,583
They're a good team.

319
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,916
And now it's time for
Kaleido Stage's first ever

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,833
diabolo battle!

321
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:41,333
In this corner, we have the
world-champion, Rosetta!

322
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,750
And in this corner, with only
five days' diabolo experience,

323
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,625
is Sora.

324
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,791
Ready? Battle!

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Got it.

326
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,541
Yes.

327
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,708
Lookin' good! Let's go, Sora!

328
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,708
You can do it, Rosetta!

329
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,000
Here!

330
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,125
Yeah?

331
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,625
I lost it!

332
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,583
Rosetta made a mistake!

333
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,625
I know!

334
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,250
And Rosetta wins it!

335
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,166
They did it!

336
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,833
Sora's amazing!

337
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:43,833
Rematch!

338
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,833
Bravo! Bravo!

339
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,208
Rosetta became
a performer after all...

340
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,958
Sora? When I was
nine years old I won

341
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,458
the diabolo world championship
for the first time.

342
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,500
In the interviews
there was always a crowd

343
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,000
standing behind the press.

344
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,875
They were the ones who
watched the competition,

345
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,541
and they seemed
so glad to be there.

346
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:09,166
I remember feeling
so proud to perform diabolo.

347
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,916
I'd completely forgotten
how happy it made me.

348
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,083
I'd forgotten how much
I used to love diabolo.

349
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,041
But I remember it now.

350
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,875
Thanks to Kaleido Stage and
thanks to you, too, Sora.

351
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,750
Oh. Oh, Rosetta, I--

352
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,125
That's so sweet!

353
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,000
It's awesome!

354
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,875
I owe this all to you.

355
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,458
Thanks for everything, Sora.

356
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,958
Wow...

357
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,750
So, you're leaving anyway?

358
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,875
Yeah. I'll miss you, Sora.

359
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,416
The show yesterday was a
great success thanks to you.

360
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,250
It was a thrill
to watch your act.

361
00:21:55,333 --> 00:22:00,916
Well, I really learned a lot in
my week here at Kaleido Stage.

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,916
I wish you'd consider staying
on with us a little longer.

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,333
I can't.

364
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,916
Are you getting back
at me for last week?

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,375
No, I just wanna go home

366
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,875
and get in touch with
why I love diabolo again.

367
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,750
Cheer up.

368
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,000
You look like your girlfriend
just broke up with you, Boss.

369
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,375
Yeah, that's kinda
how it feels...

370
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,250
Buh bye!

371
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,916
Good luck, Rosetta!

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,833
Merci, Sora.

373
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,458
You should tap into
your commercial value.

374
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,750
And so Layla's father
came to Kaleido Stage,

375
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,791
but he left without seeing
the show. It seems like he

376
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,541
thinks of her as just some
kind of a business tool.

377
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,333
He even tried to make up
for missing her birthday

378
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,000
by throwing his money around.

379
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,375
Well, if he's going to be
that way, we'll have to make

380
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,791
her birthday party
a success on our own, right?

381
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,083
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

382
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,375
Next time on Kaleido Star,

383
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,875
'An Amazing Star,
Even In Tough Times.'

384
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,416
My wings are my dream,
and on toward the sky...
