1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,791
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,166
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,208
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,041
I know it's a little late, but
happy New Year everybody!

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,166
Well, well, well.

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,500
How did you spend
your New Year's Day?

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,708
Shrine visits?

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,958
A New Year's meal?

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,000
Did you get New Year's gifts?

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,333
As for me, well I'm
not feeling too festive.

11
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,333
My little sister
was born last year,

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,916
and this will be our
first New Year's together.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,375
I should be happy,
but I'm still so upset.

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,500
There's nothing
I can do about it now.

15
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:56,833
Things can't stay like this
forever, but, but, but...

16
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,916
You two did a
great job out there.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,250
Followed by Layla
and Yuri's success,

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,041
we were able to secure
two consecutive wins.

19
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,250
Good work.

20
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,625
I want you to
start rehearsing for

21
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,250
the New Year's show immediately.

22
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,125
In fact, let's start tomorrow.

23
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,708
This show will be your
triumphal performance.

24
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,333
Needless to say, I want to see
the Demon Spiral as a climax.

25
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,625
You got that, Mia?

26
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,291
Yes sir.

27
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,125
Excuse me...but about Sora?

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,208
Sora!

29
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,750
Is Sora going to be onstage?

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,875
The festival
contest isn't over yet.

31
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,041
I can't believe you withdrew.

32
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,958
You're the worst.

33
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,583
You disgraced the festival.

34
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,708
You ran away from the stage.

35
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,833
A serious match
was taking place.

36
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,041
It's a place where you
destroy the dreams of others.

37
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,500
I told myself I would
fight to the finish.

38
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,625
I'm so ashamed.

39
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,166
But in the end, I just...

40
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,708
I'm disappointed in you Sora.

41
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,833
I'm sorry for the trouble
that I caused you.

42
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,291
Amazing and Sad Homecoming.

43
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,083
Hey boss, Sora's gone!

44
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,333
Yes, I know.

45
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,625
What?!

46
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,291
Let Mia know.

47
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,291
We'll have to recast Sora's role
in the New Year's show.

48
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,458
And here I am back home.

49
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,541
'Kay.

50
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,666
Sora?

51
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,291
But Sora?

52
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:48,291
I...I um, I'm home.

53
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,875
Well welcome home Sora.

54
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,916
Please don't shock
me like that again.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,833
You could at least call to let
me know you're coming home.

56
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,166
Sorry.

57
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,750
It's just so unexpected.

58
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,500
Um well...I thought...since it's
New Year's and everything...

59
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,750
But Sora, don't your rehearsals
start right after the New Year?

60
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,583
Yeah...well...I decided
to skip it this time.

61
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,083
Skip rehearsal?

62
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,333
Did something happen?

63
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,541
Uh uh, nothing.

64
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,791
I can't believe
Yume's gotten so big.

65
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,333
I came home Yume.

66
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,375
I'm your big sister.

67
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,708
I just thought that once she
has the baby... once she has a

68
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,875
baby of her own she
won't need me anymore.

69
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,333
Sora.

70
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Your mother and the baby
are working hard in there.

71
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,791
Let's cheer them on.

72
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,958
And Sora.

73
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,083
Yes?

74
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,000
I'd like for you
to name your sister.

75
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,458
Are you sure you want me to?

76
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,208
I've always wanted
you to name my baby.

77
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,625
Oh.

78
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,291
Thank you Yume.

79
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,958
Because of you
I finally feel like

80
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,000
I've become a
part of the family.

81
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,666
My mom and dad would
love for me to stay at home.

82
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,208
I think I'll just
stay here forever.

83
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,833
I won't go back
to the stage anymore.

84
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,458
Hello, Naegino residence?

85
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,083
I...don't understand.

86
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,166
One moment please.

87
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,541
Sora?

88
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,416
Someone named
Mia's on the phone.

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,958
She's one of your
friends I met, right?

90
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,416
Hello?

91
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,583
Mia?

92
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,916
Sora!

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,583
Hey everyone, I found her!

94
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,250
Really?

95
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,916
Thank goodness!

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,625
Sorry, you're worried about me?

97
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,083
Of course, you left
without telling us!

98
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:03,000
Um...well there's a lot of stuff
I wanna think over. And...

99
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,041
Hey Sora, you're
coming back aren't ya?

100
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,708
Yeah, when are you coming back?

101
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,333
We're all waiting for you!

102
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,750
Well I...I'm doing just fine,
so don't worry about me.

103
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
Thanks for checking
in with me though.

104
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,250
Bye.

105
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,708
Sora!

106
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,500
Well well.

107
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,166
I never thought I'd come
home to see you here.

108
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,458
For a moment I
thought I was dreaming.

109
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,958
You're exaggerating.

110
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,666
So, are you gonna be
staying for a while?

111
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,916
I've worked hard, and I deserve
some time off, you know?

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,333
I think you're right.

113
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,041
Midori, would you mind getting
me another beer please?

114
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,666
My my, two in one night?

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,458
It's been a while since
the whole family's

116
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,916
been together, that's
reason to celebrate, right?

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,583
Yes, it is.

118
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,625
Back in my own room.

119
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,791
Which five year old girl
does this room belong to?

120
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,375
Fool!

121
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,666
You were hiding in my
luggage weren't you?

122
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,250
I always meant to come
to Japan at least once.

123
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,875
If only to check
out the geisha's

124
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,708
and the pretty young girls.

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,833
You shouldn't bother with me.

126
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,208
You're wasting your time.

127
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,541
Hmm?

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,625
The stage...I'm not...

129
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,166
So you've decided that
you're not going back?

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,541
That's right.

131
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,333
I see.

132
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:38,125
Well...we'll just see
how things play out.

133
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,958
If you have given
up the stage,

134
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,416
then soon you will lose
the ability to see me.

135
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:59,125
Demon...Spiral!

136
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,208
Don't look so down Mia.

137
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,666
I'm sure that Sora
will be back soon.

138
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,166
Excuse me?

139
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,208
Don't just stand there!

140
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,000
If you don't start
giving me some direction,

141
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,375
I won't know what's going on.

142
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
Oh...um...I'm sorry.

143
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,416
Are you trying to make
Leon and I look bad?

144
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,083
If you don't wanna
work, then quit.

145
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,375
What's up with her?

146
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,791
She thinks she's so special.

147
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,250
There's nothing we can do.

148
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,833
I mean she's number
one in the world, right?

149
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,208
Yeah but she's too confident.

150
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,583
Maybe it's all an act.

151
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,125
Well...it's nice not
to have that girl around.

152
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,583
Happy New Year everyone!

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This is the most lavish
New Year's meal we've ever had!

154
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,041
Mom your ozouni
soup, it's to die for!

155
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,041
Well have as much as you'd like.

156
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,875
Looks like we've made
it to Sora's home town.

157
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,375
You know it's
not that bad a place.

158
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,375
I was really hoping
to come here alone.

159
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,458
There's no time
to space out Ken.

160
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,541
You came to see Sora, right?

161
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,041
But all I know is
her street address.

162
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,791
I don't know...
how to find her house.

163
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,583
Kid I'm a police officer.

164
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,875
Just let me handle it.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,583
Happy New Year.

166
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,916
Sora why don't you take a bath.

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,416
I think you should
begin the New Year

168
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,458
by cleansing your body,
and maybe even...

169
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,750
Fool, how long are
you gonna stick around?

170
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,791
I already told you I'm not going
back to the Kaleido Stage.

171
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,333
Why don't you go and
find someone else?

172
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,166
If that's true, then why
are you still training?

173
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm just stretching to
work off that meal!

174
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,166
I see.

175
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,333
Then you should take a shower

176
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,125
since you've gotten all
sweaty exercising.

177
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,500
Sora!

178
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,666
The phone's for you!

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,458
Coming!

180
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,166
That certainly didn't work
the way I'd planned it.

181
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Who is it?

182
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,083
It's Miss Kurata.

183
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,958
It's Manami?

184
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,041
Manami!

185
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,458
Hey, how are you?

186
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,166
I can't believe you Sora.

187
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,541
You could have at
least called to let me

188
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,916
know that you're in town.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,875
Yeah, sorry.

190
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,208
I'm coming over
with Sayaka and Miki.

191
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,500
So how about a New Year's
party at your place?

192
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,083
Uh yeah, sure.

193
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,125
Hey!

194
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,291
Could you please
tell me where...

195
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,875
Not again.

196
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,416
I tell you, these Japanese
are a bunch of weirdos.

197
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,958
Well um...maybe it's just your
approach that isn't working.

198
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,166
Why don't you
let me give it a try.

199
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,291
Excuse me ladies?

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,875
Check him out!

201
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,833
Who is he?

202
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,500
He looks super cool!

203
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,291
Wow, maybe he's some

204
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,500
super famous soccer
player or something!

205
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,666
No way, he's an
American movie star!

206
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,291
Yeah, he's cute,
let's take pictures!

207
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,666
Uhh excuse me?

208
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,875
I've got a question!

209
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,333
Do any of you know Sora!

210
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,708
Sora!

211
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,208
Happy New Year Sora,
from all of us!

212
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,250
Oh it's been so long you guys!

213
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,875
Please make yourselves at home.

214
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,166
Thank you Mrs. Naegino.

215
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,541
I have to tell you Sora,
I never thought that

216
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,000
you'd actually go to America.

217
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,625
Oh, really?

218
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,291
It's just so hard to believe.

219
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,125
I was surprised too.

220
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,291
I knew that being a
Kaleido star was your dream,

221
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,666
but you really did it!

222
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,166
Manami, you got to see
Sora's show, didn't you?

223
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,208
Yeah.

224
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,083
I saw the legendary
great maneuver.

225
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
So tell us, what was it like?

226
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,250
Umm, well, how do I begin?

227
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:19,041
I felt like I was flying
in the sky with them.

228
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,458
It's strange, but I felt
like I was getting this

229
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,416
surge of positive energy
just from watching them.

230
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,333
It was...amazing.

231
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,416
Wow.

232
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,625
I wish I could see it.

233
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,333
You're getting to perform
and play leading roles,

234
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm so jealous!

235
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,000
What?

236
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,291
Oh yeah, Sayaka's an
up and coming voice actor.

237
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,041
What?

238
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,291
That's so cool!

239
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
You're voicing anime?

240
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,125
Well I'm trying.

241
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,375
In fact, in the last round of
auditions I even made it to

242
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,750
the final callbacks
for the leading role...

243
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,958
but I didn't get the part.

244
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,416
Don't give up!

245
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
There will be other
shows to audition for.

246
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,583
Yeah.

247
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,208
Well, I guess I just have
to work on my skills, huh?

248
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey Miki, whatever
happened to your dreams

249
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
of being a manga artist?

250
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,250
I've decided to
go to junior college

251
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,250
and get a real job
like everyone else.

252
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,958
I still draw all the time,
but it's just a hobby now.

253
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,958
But Miki,
you're such a good artist!

254
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,250
That's such a waste.

255
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,208
When something you
love becomes your job

256
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,625
it gets kinda tough you know?

257
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,208
I just love manga so much that

258
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,458
I don't ever wanna
grow to hate it.

259
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,333
It's the one thing
I've always enjoyed,

260
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,708
and I don't wanna lose it.

261
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,333
Miki, you're such a realist!

262
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,750
I guess.

263
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,041
So what about you Sora,
your dreams have all come true.

264
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,708
Yeah, but why do
you look so down?

265
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,916
Well...I don't...I just don't
know how to explain.

266
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,708
Hey, why don't you
show us a few tricks.

267
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,000
Will you please?

268
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,791
It is New Year's after all.

269
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,708
Please Sora?

270
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,916
Okay.

271
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,625
That's so cool!

272
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,916
How are you able
to do that Sora?

273
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,750
Wow!

274
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,958
You're so awesome!

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,250
This applause...

276
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,958
it's different from the
applause at the festival.

277
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,291
But what makes it so different?

278
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,583
That's so cool!

279
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,250
The audience is applauding
for the same reason.

280
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,000
So, have I changed?

281
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,583
I'm having fun.

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,166
I enjoy performing for
Manami and my friends.

283
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,041
That's it!

284
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,291
A show that everyone enjoys!

285
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,916
That's the Kaleido
Stage that I love.

286
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,791
That's the kind of
show I want to be in.

287
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,583
Tadaa!

288
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,458
Bravo!

289
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,541
I can tell you're a real pro!

290
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,250
Well we have to go
this way to get home.

291
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,416
Okay.

292
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,208
I promise to come
see your show one day.

293
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,708
Me too, me too!

294
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,458
See ya Sora!

295
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,958
Bye!

296
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,916
I've decided to go to college.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,541
Don't get me wrong, I'm not
giving up my dream of

298
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,125
becoming a hair stylist;
I've just decided to take

299
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,875
some time to talk it
over with my parents.

300
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,416
Thanks to you
I've started thinking

301
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,458
a lot about my future,
and about chasing my dreams.

302
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,666
Because of me?

303
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,166
That's right.

304
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,291
I watched you work so hard
trying to achieve your dream,

305
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,625
and that inspired me
to follow my dreams too.

306
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,166
Sora, you helped me.

307
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,791
You gave me a dream.

308
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
Gave you a dream?

309
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,875
Why did you come home?

310
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,125
Does it have anything
to do with you quitting

311
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,000
in the middle of a circus
festival performance?

312
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,708
How do you know about that?

313
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,333
I read about it on the internet.

314
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,333
Yeah.

315
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,000
But that's not the only reason.

316
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,416
Your mom was
worried sick about you.

317
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,958
What?!

318
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,250
She called me and asked me to
spend some time with you

319
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,416
to get your mind off...
whatever was bothering you.

320
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,041
What are you so upset about?

321
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:50,833
Well I...Manami I walked
out of the Kaleido Stage.

322
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,708
I think that's fine.

323
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,833
I mean, as long as you
don't have any regrets.

324
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,958
Back in school you always
said that you liked to go out

325
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,500
and do things rather
than thinking about them.

326
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,458
You told me that thinking about
stuff might make you hesitant.

327
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,958
And then you wouldn't
do it, and you'd regret it.

328
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,291
So if you've made your
decision and have no regrets,

329
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,041
then I have no problem with it.

330
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,458
But if you have even a bit
of regret in your heart...

331
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,375
then you should go
back to Kaleido Stage

332
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,958
and give it another shot.

333
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,333
Just walk up to them and say

334
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,833
"I've changed my mind and
I wanna come back".

335
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,250
You're the only person
I know that can do that Sora.

336
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,250
And I think that's cool.

337
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,458
Manami...

338
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,416
Remember when I
came to visit in America,

339
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,583
and I told you that I came to
see your regretful face?

340
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,791
Yeah?

341
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,750
This may sound selfish,

342
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,041
but I don't wanna see your
regretful face right now.

343
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,166
Ahhhhh!

344
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,000
What were you thinking,
swallowing that man whole?

345
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,583
I guess I'm gonna have to
leave without even seeing her.

346
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,041
You'd better watch out lion,
or I'm gonna tear you to pieces.

347
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,333
Mr Policeman?!

348
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,666
Oh, Sora!

349
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,958
I've been looking for you!

350
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,916
I even brought
Ken as a tagalong.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,833
Oh you did!

352
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,041
I'm...a tagalong...

353
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,291
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,125
I didn't mean to make
everyone worry so much.

355
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,583
We've wrapped rehearsals
on the New Year's shows,

356
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,416
so I came out here to find you.

357
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
The New Year's show?

358
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,083
May and Leon's
triumphal performance.

359
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,791
Since tomorrow's opening day,
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

360
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,625
What!

361
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,041
But Ken, you just got here!

362
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,666
Unfortunately, we
already purchased our

363
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,458
plane tickets for the trip home!

364
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,791
I see.

365
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,291
You're coming back, aren't you?

366
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,666
Sora...I hope you didn't...

367
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
If I go back to Kaleido
Stage feeling like this,

368
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,291
I'm afraid I'll just get
in everyone's way.

369
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,583
Well when you
dropped out of the festival,

370
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,791
I was actually
a little relieved.

371
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,333
I was relieved that you
chose to drop out rather

372
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,958
than continue with
something you felt wasn't right.

373
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,833
You did the right thing.

374
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,125
If you don't like
to compete,

375
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,000
create a show
without competition.

376
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,708
Create a show?

377
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,250
Myself?

378
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,500
I wanna see more
of your fun show, Sora.

379
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,791
When I watch you fly by with a
smile it makes me feel happy,

380
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,500
and I just want...
to tell you... that I...

381
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,166
I like you, Sora.

382
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,333
Ken...

383
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,083
And I like you lots too.

384
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,666
I like seeing you smile
as you fly through the air.

385
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,708
As your first fan,
I'd be thrilled to see

386
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,791
an exciting new show
starring Sora.

387
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,166
Right Mr. Second Fan?

388
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,666
Second fan?!

389
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,000
Just remember that all of your
fans are behind you 100%.

390
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,583
But...what I meant was...

391
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,500
We love you Sora!

392
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,333
I'm going to create
a fun Kaleido Stage

393
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,250
show with no more competition.

394
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,416
I want you to be my dream.

395
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,541
You have what it takes
to be a true Kaleido Star.

396
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,333
The answer to all of these are
to be found inside of you.

397
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,041
Go after your dream,
and don't let yourself get lost.

398
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,041
If you do that,
the road to becoming a

399
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,208
Kaleido Star will
appear for you.

400
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,458
That's it!

401
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,375
I'm going to create a
Kaleido Stage show

402
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,166
with no competition
that's fun for everyone.

403
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,041
That's my real dream.

404
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,750
If I can do that,
then it won't be long 'til I

405
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,250
finally become a Kaleido Star!

406
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,541
Is something wrong?

407
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,083
Thank you Ken!

408
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,333
I've decided that I'm gonna
go back to the Kaleido Stage.

409
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,750
I promise you.

410
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,916
We'll be waiting.

411
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,541
And when you make
it back to the states

412
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,583
I'll pick you up at the airport.

413
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,375
Thanks you guys!

414
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,125
I see.

415
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,083
Yeah, I think that's great.

416
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,750
Thank you, Manami.

417
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,250
You did the same for me.

418
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,125
Let's do our best.

419
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,500
So that's the real
reason I came home.

420
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,250
I hope you're not mad.

422
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,083
I know it's a pathetic
story but after a lot of

423
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,291
thinking I've decided
to go back...and well...

424
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,791
Midori?

425
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,500
This is for you Sora.

426
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,083
What is it?

427
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,166
Since you didn't get to visit
the shrine this New Year's...

428
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,250
A good luck charm.

429
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,416
Please take
good care of yourself.

430
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,166
Oh thank you.

431
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,333
Don't ever stop trying
'til you're satisfied.

432
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,958
Yume, I'm gonna do my best,
and be a good example...

433
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,208
Oh Yume, you're silly!

434
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,750
One more time,
I'm gonna try one more time.

435
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,791
And this time I won't
lose sight of my dream.

436
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,375
Never.

437
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,333
Seems like the fog
of confusion has cleared.

438
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,125
Thanks for waiting everyone!

439
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,708
My name is
Sora Naegino, and I'm back!

440
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,583
I really appreciate
everyone waiting for me.

441
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,750
This time I've got the
confidence and the

442
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,875
determination to make
my dreams come true.

443
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,458
And no one's gonna stop me.

444
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,625
No one, no one!

445
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,833
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"My Amazing Fresh Start"!

446
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:26,458
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky.
