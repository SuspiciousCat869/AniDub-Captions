1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,750
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start.

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,833
So make sure that your
room is brightly lit

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,166
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,500
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,041
Have you ever had times
when you didn't know

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,000
what you wanted to do?
Or where you wanted to go?

7
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,625
Well, that's exactly the
way I'm feeling right now.

8
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,000
I worked hard, trying to
get into Kaleido Stage.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,583
Then I worked hard so I would
be acknowledged by everyone.

10
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,375
And then I worked hard
trying to catch up with Layla.

11
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,541
But I wonder what I'm
working hard for now?

12
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,750
No! Not good. Not good.

13
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,958
I can't become a star feeling
all wishy-washy like this.

14
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,958
I can't! I can't! I can't!

15
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,833
That's right. This is
a match with my fate!

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,875
Now!

17
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,583
Demon! Spiral!

18
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,541
Her movement is too irregular;
I can't even follow it.

19
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,208
Amazing. But can he grab her?

20
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,500
Oh, no! She's not high enough!

21
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,125
A devil's maneuver?

22
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,500
That certainly
might be appropriate

23
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,083
for a partner of mine.

24
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,875
You mean...

25
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,291
It's been decided.

26
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,208
"Amazing Angelic Counterattack."

27
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,583
Sora's been through a lot,
but this must be a shock.

28
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,416
Yeah, I don't even know
what to say to her.

29
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,666
Let's leave her alone for now.

30
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,250
Sora...

31
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,541
Demon Spiral...

32
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,125
May had a shoulder injury,

33
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,833
but she didn't
let that stop her.

34
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,250
She used it to invent
a new maneuver.

35
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,375
And she got the Phoenix Ticket.

36
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,916
While I...

37
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,625
Sora...

38
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,250
Layla...

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,750
You know, I was stunned, too.

40
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,458
I didn't think May
would go that far.

41
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,083
I was actually quite
impressed that she

42
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,375
took advantage of her injuries
to invent a new maneuver.

43
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,625
I'm sorry, Layla.

44
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,708
Three years ago,
before Yuri and I

45
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,000
participated in the Circus
Festival, we got a message...

46
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,416
to meet with Kalos.

47
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,416
Good. You're here.
Listen carefully, both of you.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,208
If you can't win,
don't come back.

49
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,375
What?!

50
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,250
If you don't win in
the Circus Festival,

51
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,166
there's no place for
you at Kaleido Stage.

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,875
Did Kalos really say that?

53
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,208
Yes, he did.

54
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,541
That's why I had no other
choice. I had to win.

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,083
But, with all that pressure,

56
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,166
you still won the match
with your own fate.

57
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,083
You're really amazing.

58
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,750
What will you do now?

59
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,750
I guess I'll improve my skills.

60
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,625
That way I'll keep up with May.

61
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,416
Sora, really.
I can't believe this.

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,750
Do you think you lost to May

63
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,791
because you didn't
have enough skills?

64
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,125
Huh?

65
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,083
Look, if you didn't
have the skills,

66
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,541
I would never have recommended
you in the first place.

67
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,458
No, it's something else.

68
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,833
You lost the festival because
it only meant so much to you.

69
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,500
What? No, you're wrong!

70
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,791
To me, it was something
I needed to enter and to win

71
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,333
no matter what it took.

72
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,291
To me, it was worth
that much effort.

73
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,833
To you, however, it
wasn't worth that much.

74
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,541
Sora, I'll ask you one
more time. Be honest.

75
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,791
Do you seriously want to
participate in the Festival

76
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,958
no matter what happens to you?

77
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,916
Yes!

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Once you make up your mind
to get something done,

79
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,583
you never give it up.

80
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,583
That's something I know
better than anyone else.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
But here you are right now,

82
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,791
and you've given up
on everything.

83
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:30,000
To me, that's proof you weren't
serious about it at all.

84
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,000
I think I told you
after the Salome show.

85
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,041
I can't feel enough of a
competitive edge from you

86
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,916
right now to be afraid of you.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,833
You've lost track
of what's important.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,541
I wanted you to
enter the festival.

89
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,666
Wait, Layla!

90
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,041
I can't believe
what I did...

91
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,666
I...

92
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,291
I disappointed Layla.

93
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,375
I let her down.

94
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,708
Sora, Sora! Untape me!

95
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,958
I want to do something.
I have to do something!

96
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,583
What can I do?
What? Tell me, Fool.

97
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,208
I don't know the answer to that.

98
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,666
Well, you're no help.

99
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,875
And I thought you were
supposed to be on my side.

100
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,250
Can't you give me some clever
advice or something like that?

101
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:43,083
I'm a spirit of the stage.
So I am neither friend nor foe.

102
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:47,083
One more chance. I want
to have one more chance.

103
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,791
Oww! I can't believe
this is happening to me!

104
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,250
I am so pathetic!

105
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,750
The only thing I can
tell you is this.

106
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:00,041
The deadline for Circus Festival
entries hasn't passed yet.

107
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:09,125
The Sagittarius is still not
able to get out of the darkness.

108
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,208
But nearby, I can see
another arrow, a bright arrow.

109
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,041
It points as if it's
showing her the way out.

110
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,458
One more arrow?

111
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,708
Phoenix Tickets are
the "seed" right.

112
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,750
They're given to the
two people who won.

113
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:31,291
Two... two!

114
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,916
Hey! There's one more ticket!

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,625
Hmm...

116
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,875
Ticket! Ticket! Ticket!

117
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,750
--There's one more ticket!
--I can't... I can't breathe.

118
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,666
I just wet myself.

119
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,000
You know, Yuri is studying
in Paris right now.

120
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
The Circus Festival
is held in Paris, too.

121
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,625
So it's perfect!

122
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,333
Take me to Paris, quick!

123
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,458
Paris?

124
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,541
Wait, Yuri hasn't
even registered!

125
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,291
And we don't know
that he wants to.

126
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,458
And you can't take
a taxi to Paris.

127
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,416
Impossible or not,
there's nothing to do but ask!

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
I realized I can't keep
moping about how I lost to May.

129
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,833
I just have to
acknowledge my defeat

130
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,583
and do what I can do now.

131
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,416
I'll be away from
Kids' Stage for a while,

132
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,291
but everything should be okay.

133
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,416
I talked to Marion,
and she's fine with it.

134
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,833
Do you think Sora's
back to normal?

135
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,041
If it's true, there's nothing
we can do to stop her now.

136
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,375
Sora!

137
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,916
Rosetta!

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Here's a guide book to Paris.
I used it when I was there.

139
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,166
It has some French phrases,
too, although it's not much.

140
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,458
Thank you. It'll help.

141
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,458
Also, here's a winter coat.

142
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,666
It gets cold
over there you know.

143
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,208
Thank you, Rosetta.

144
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,875
Bye!

145
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,041
Go, Sora!

146
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,875
She's lucky.
Someday I'll go to Paris...

147
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,166
and see Mr. Charlie the clown.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,000
So, you're rarin' to go, too?

149
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,250
Well, if you put it like
that, I'm Parin' to go!

150
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,083
Je... Je... Je t'aime.

151
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,958
Why that's...

152
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
The God of Death's come back!

153
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,875
Wait here. I'll check us in.

154
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,500
Wow.

155
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,375
Leon. It's been a long time.

156
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,250
So, you remember me?
I'm touched.

157
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,583
And you. Are you
his new partner?

158
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:50,708
Yes. I'm Leon's partner.
I'm May Wong.

159
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,625
Poor thing.

160
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,500
Once the Circus Festival is
over, you'll be discarded, too.

161
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,833
Hey, Lady! Who do
you think you are?!

162
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,875
Hey, you better not put us on
the same floor as Leon Oswald!

163
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,291
Being near him makes
my performers nervous.

164
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,416
If you can't do this,
I'll change hotels!

165
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,958
Yes, of course, sir.

166
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,625
Oh. This is a message for
Ken Robbins of Kaleido Stage.

167
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,666
That is you, no?

168
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,541
What? For me?

169
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,625
"I'll give you a
chance to show off."

170
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,458
So, did you hear it, too?

171
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,958
The whisper of the God of Death?

172
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,875
I will give you a chance.

173
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,708
I will give you
the perfect chance

174
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,916
to show off in today's show.

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,291
"The whisper of
the God of Death"?

176
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,333
How do you know that?
Were you his partner too?

177
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:50,791
Partner? Nobody can
be Leon's partner.

178
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,833
Nobody but her.

179
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,500
But "her"?

180
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,500
Sora's here?

181
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,041
Uh, let's see...
This is where I am.

182
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,666
The drama school
where Yuri is...

183
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,500
I can't read French!

184
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,875
Where? Where? Where?!

185
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,583
Where are you, Yuri!

186
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,250
I see. I'll try to look
for her too. Goodbye.

187
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,958
Alright Sora,
where could you be?

188
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,750
Er, uh... Me-Merci.

189
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,208
Now I'm broke.

190
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,583
I spent the last of
my money on that cab.

191
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,583
But at least... Yuri's here.

192
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,916
Non.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,125
What? Not here?

194
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,791
Mais, c'est bien ici
le Conservatoire...

195
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,000
Sorry...

196
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,625
--What am I gonna do?
--If you're looking for Yuri...

197
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,833
He wasn't in the class today.

198
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,291
What? So, he's here
at the school?

199
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,458
Yeah.

200
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,958
Liar!

201
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,791
Uh. Excuse me, but do you know
where I can find Yuri now?

202
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,083
He, uh, marches to his own beat.

203
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,250
Or you could say he's kind
of difficult to approach.

204
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,000
Hey, I don't know.

205
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,375
Well, where does he live?

206
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,041
No idea. Sorry. Bye.

207
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,583
It's a dead end. What now?

208
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,291
The Circus Festival!

209
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,250
I'm sure... I'm sure
Yuri will come here, too.

210
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,458
I'm sure! I'm sure!

211
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,125
Oh... So, this is the hall.

212
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,625
Wow, they're performing!

213
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,333
Huh?

214
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,125
Merci, merci.

215
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,250
Oh, I know! If I make
some money here,

216
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,125
I can keep looking for Yuri,
and I can eat something!

217
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,125
I'm not at a dead end yet.
Not yet! Not yet!

218
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,333
Hey, they're getting fired up.

219
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
Oh. Hi, Mute and Alice.

220
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,958
She's quite a performer,
isn't she?

221
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,416
She's amazing. But I've
never seen her before.

222
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,291
She's pretty good. Who is she?

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
Ta-da!

224
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,583
Oh, no...

225
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,333
Superb!

226
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,291
Brava!

227
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,708
Oh? Merci! Merci! Merci! Wow!

228
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,875
Now I can buy
something to eat. Huh?

229
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,500
Hey, are you all right?
Did you hurt yourself?

230
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,208
Oh. I can understand him.

231
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,708
What luck.

232
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,250
What?! What was that? Hey!

233
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,625
Really. I thought you
hurt yourself back there.

234
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,041
I was worried.

235
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,375
Who would have ever thought
she was just hungry?

236
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,208
Sorry. I'm starving.

237
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,375
I haven't eaten anything
since I got to Paris.

238
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,375
You were famished and you
still performed like that?

239
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,500
How impressive.

240
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,541
Well, I had to do it.

241
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,041
I want to enter
the Circus Festival.

242
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,791
What? You're going to
participate in the festival?

243
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,083
I want to! What about you,
Alice and Mute?

244
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,708
We do. We're like you.

245
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,083
We want to win the festival
and get the world's attention.

246
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,875
But it's not only for ourselves.

247
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,958
If we win, we'll organize
a performance team

248
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,375
with these guys right here.

249
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,333
And then travel around the
world. That's our dream.

250
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,541
And the weight of
everyone's dream...

251
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
rests heavily on
Mute's shoulders.

252
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,083
I guess.

253
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,166
Wow! What a great dream!

254
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,083
Sora, didn't you also come here
to make your dream come true?

255
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,291
Well, then... Don't give up.

256
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,416
Somewhere out there, an angel
always keeps an eye on us.

257
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,333
An angel... who keeps
an eye on us...

258
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,541
Sora!

259
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,166
Yeah?! Huh?

260
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,875
Hello Sora.

261
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,333
Yuri!

262
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,083
Yuri? I think
that's Yuri Killian.

263
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,875
Does she know Yuri Killian,
the winner of the last festival?

264
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,916
I don't believe this.
Who is she?

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,416
Yuri!

266
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,416
Finally. I found you.

267
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,125
But I was sure you
would come here.

268
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,791
I just knew it!

269
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,500
Who ever thought I would
see you somewhere like this.

270
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
It's been a long time.

271
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,583
Yeah. It has a
different atmosphere

272
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,666
from America or Japan.

273
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,291
It's relaxing, isn't it?

274
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,791
Yeah.

275
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:12,041
It looks like you've completely
adjusted to life in Paris.

276
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,166
You think so?

277
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,833
Yeah.

278
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,875
Well... To tell you the truth,
I didn't come to Paris for fun.

279
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,916
I came to ask you for a favor.

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,708
A favor? What kind?

281
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,833
The big kind. Did you receive
Phoenix Tickets this year?

282
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,875
Yes. What about them?

283
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,500
Let's use them.

284
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,666
Yuri, I want to participate in
the Circus Festival with you.

285
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,791
Wow, that is a big favor, Sora.

286
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,500
Please, Yuri! Help me!
You're my last hope.

287
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,958
You're the only one
that can help.

288
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,250
Sora, it wasn't an accident

289
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,875
I was walking by
the festival today.

290
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,708
I went over there looking for
you, because Layla asked me to.

291
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,291
What? Layla asked you?

292
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,875
And I heard the gist of what
happened at Kaleido Stage.

293
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,625
You really are determined to
follow your dream, aren't you?

294
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,041
Does this mean...

295
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,291
But I think it's too
tough for you to handle.

296
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:19,375
Huh? Why do you say that?

297
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,333
Sora, you don't know
the nature of this festival.

298
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,041
It's a place where you
make your dream come true.

299
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,458
But at the same time,

300
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,541
it's a place where you
destroy the dreams of others.

301
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,166
That's the kind of place
the Circus Festival is.

302
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,291
I already know that, Yuri.

303
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,125
I also know victory means
beating everyone else

304
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,125
and destroying their dreams
to make mine come true.

305
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,666
But there's no other choice.

306
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,750
If I want to be a real Kaleido
Star, I have to win here.

307
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:51,625
Fair play, friendship, and
consideration don't exist.

308
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,916
Let down your guard,
and you'll get jumped.

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,375
It's that kind of world.
Still interested?

310
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, I can handle it.

311
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,250
Okay. Then let me
give you an example.

312
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,958
Your friend Ken.
Just before you perform,

313
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,208
you get a call
saying he's collapsed.

314
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,083
He's in the hospital and he
says he really wants to see you.

315
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
He's very sick.

316
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,500
What do you do, Sora?

317
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,083
Well, I'd have to go...

318
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,500
Are you sure about that?

319
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,708
The call might be a lie
made up by another performer.

320
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,291
Oh, yeah. I hadn't
thought of that.

321
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,416
Sorry. I think I was being

322
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,791
a little mean with
those questions.

323
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,416
All right then.

324
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,625
Yuri...

325
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,583
Let's participate
in the festival.

326
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,291
I'll make an application
for our entry tomorrow.

327
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,458
Thank you, thank you!

328
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,041
So this is where you live?

329
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,791
Wow... Did you paint
all of these, Yuri?

330
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,291
Yep. What with spending all
my time here and at school,

331
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,500
I started wanting some company.

332
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,541
So I picked up a brush,
and got into it.

333
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,541
Everyone is smiling.

334
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,166
When I was at Kaleido Stage,
I don't remember

335
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,750
looking at the faces
of the audience much.

336
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,541
But when I started painting...

337
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:20,708
I realized just how wonderful
smiling faces could be.

338
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,291
Is this the picture
you're painting now?

339
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,916
Yes. When I tried to get at
the essence of the smile,

340
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,291
it became an angel.

341
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,708
Angel...

342
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,500
It's May.

343
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,375
I'd like to start training
soon, if that's okay.

344
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,750
All right.

345
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,625
So, this is it.

346
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,166
Leon Oswald, you say?

347
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,541
Yeah, that's right.

348
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,125
Leon and May are
doing a maneuver

349
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,791
called the Demon Spiral.

350
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,416
I suppose we'll need
something on the same level.

351
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,875
Shall we try an
Angel's Maneuver?

352
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,458
An Angel's... Maneuver?

353
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:15,250
That's right. To compete
with their Demon Maneuver.

354
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,875
Yes.

355
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,541
Sora?!

356
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,375
Hey, we'd liked to help.

357
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,208
Alice and Mute!

358
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,708
You don't have much time
to practice for the show.

359
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,541
And we can also learn
something from watching

360
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,250
the winner of the
previous festival.

361
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,458
So helping you helps us.

362
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,750
Well, Sora?

363
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:32,958
Since they're
willing to help us,

364
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
I think we should
accept their offer.

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,958
We accept.

366
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,083
Oh, thank you.

367
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,875
That's great!

368
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,250
Wow. Even among those
who enter to the festival,

369
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,041
there are nice people
like Mute and Alice.

370
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,083
Good! Now, go up higher!

371
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,541
No. That's not good at all.

372
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,875
Okay!

373
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,875
Like you're flying
upwards on your own power!

374
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,125
Yeah!

375
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,875
I won't lose to May!
I'll win this time!

376
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,875
I'll rise to meet
Layla's expectations.

377
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,250
Demon Spiral!

378
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
This is the fastest you can go?

379
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,416
--No! I can do faster!
--Then go as fast as you can!

380
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,916
Okay!

381
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,791
That's right. Do it more slowly.

382
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,833
Like an angel's wings...

383
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,000
Right!

384
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,666
I see. The winning
candidate's maneuver...

385
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,666
I'm going to win...
no matter what!

386
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,791
And the one to win...
will be me!

387
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,791
Perhaps a match with you
is my unavoidable destiny.

388
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,708
And so, it's showtime!

389
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,208
What? Yuri and Leon
know each other?

390
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,708
Wait! What happened
between the two of them?

391
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,166
How should I know?

392
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,708
What I saw during the battle
was betrayal and despair.

393
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,583
Something I believed
in is shattering!

394
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,916
Shattering! Shattering!

395
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,833
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"Cruel Amazing Festival."

396
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:26,125
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
