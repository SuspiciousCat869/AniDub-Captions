1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,708
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,500
so make sure your room
is brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,750
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,666
My name is Sora Naegino.
Ever since I was a little girl

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,458
it's been my dream
to perform with Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,708
So a few months ago I came
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,166
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,000
and sometimes I'm a little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

9
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,500
from doing my best.
There's nothing I can't do

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,875
if I work hard!

11
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,750
Well, well, well. Do any
of you out there have a pet?

12
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,708
Something you have to feed
and take care of? It can be

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,666
a lot of work, but don't
you think it's worth it?

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,666
'Cause your pet's like
a member of the family.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,166
Well, that's how I feel anyway.
And no matter how tough

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,458
things get, I'm not giving
him up. I'm not, I'm not!

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,583
'The current production of
'Cinderella' at Kaleido Stage

18
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,166
is a must-see.

19
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,958
Especially charming is the trio
of newcomers taking on the role

20
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,541
of the Fairy Godmother.
Their scene is truly magical--

21
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,333
the highlight of
the performance.

22
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,833
We can't wait to see what the
future holds for them.' Amazing!

23
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,791
Yeah!

24
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,208
This is what it feels like to
get a good review. Awesome!

25
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,000
We did it, we did it, we did it,
we did it, we did it,

26
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,375
we did it, we did it!

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,041
What the--

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,416
It's a baby seal.
But why isn't he moving?

29
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,000
 'The Amazing Seal.'

30
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,375
He must've gotten separated
from his parents. Poor baby...

31
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,541
I'll be back in a little bit.

32
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,125
Could you watch
him for me, Fool?

33
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:04,958
Huh? Watch him do what? What
am I supposed to do with you?

34
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,916
I know. I'll read
your fortune...

35
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,583
You've come up
with the hanged man.

36
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,791
This card foretells ordeals
and sacrifice. It means

37
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,291
you're about to experience
great misfortune-- What?!

38
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,375
So you can see me, can you?
Well, that doesn't mean you'll

39
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,875
be a star of the Kaleido
Stage, so let go all right?

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,541
Good morning, Sora! Sora?

41
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,291
I'm starving. Let's go see
if she's in the dining hall.

42
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,000
I guess... he didn't
like his fortune.

43
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,250
I can't believe it,
is that critic blind?

44
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,583
Talking about the
Fairy Godmothers like

45
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,000
they're something special...

46
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,083
If I'd played that role,
he'd have something to praise.

47
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,291
Keep it down...

48
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,750
Hey, I'm only saying
what you were thinking.

49
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,916
I know, but one of the
Godmothers might hear you

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,416
and get her feelings
hurt or something.

51
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,541
Oh! Sorry, Sora,
I didn't see you there.

52
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
Silly us...

53
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,875
Morning, Sora.

54
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,541
Oh, oh good morning Ken,
how's it going?

55
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,583
Is something bothering you?

56
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,541
No, I'm just not sure
what he would like is all...

57
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,750
H-H-He?

58
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,166
Yeah. I was running on the beach
this morning and that's where

59
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,416
I found him. He's adorable,
kind of round and almost as wide

60
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,958
as he is tall, but he's not very
tall, and he's super-hungry.

61
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,291
That's the kind of guy
you're attracted to?

62
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,666
What? I'm not talking about
a guy, silly. He's a seal.

63
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,041
A seal?

64
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,375
Uh huh.

65
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,541
Please don't tell me you
brought him home with you.

66
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,875
Well I-- 

67
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,041
You didn't, right?

68
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,875
See, he was really
hungry and all alone,

69
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,458
I couldn't just leave him.

70
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,875
This is bad...

71
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,041
D-- did I do something wrong?

72
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,541
Come with me.

73
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,416
He's not very big, you know.
I-- I think he's still a baby.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
And he seemed kinda weak and
sickly, like he was gonna die

75
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,958
if somebody didn't
take care of him.

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Seals eat fresh fish, not
hot dogs from the dining hall.

77
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,333
Then you'll help me?

78
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,791
I'll help you feed him,
then he goes back to the sea.

79
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,041
But-- Right.

80
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,708
That's weird.
I didn't leave it open.

81
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,458
I'm back home and
I brought some yummy food!

82
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,708
What's he doing down there?

83
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,250
He isn't here. This is awful!

84
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,375
You don't know
the meaning of 'awful.'

85
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,083
He-- He isn't where I left him!

86
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,541
Maybe he went
back to the ocean.

87
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,916
He couldn't have!

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,458
You aren't looking for
this little guy, are you?

89
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,916
I found him wandering
around on his own.

90
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,166
Jonathan!

91
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,708
What? That's not good... she's
already given it... a name.

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,833
What a surprise.

93
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,333
I saw him tottering down
the hallway early this morning.

94
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,958
You two have the
same taste in clothes.

95
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,750
I'm sorry he startled you.

96
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,875
Isn't he just the
cutest little thing?

97
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,041
Um. I don't suppose there's any
way I could keep him, is there?

98
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,625
Keep him?

99
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,958
I thought we agreed that you'd
feed him and then let him go.

100
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,500
But I was thinking Jonathan
could be a perfect mascot

101
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,375
for Kaleido Stage
if we trained him.

102
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,041
I think he'd like that.

103
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,041
I'm late for lessons! Miss
Sarah, could you take care of

104
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,500
Jonathan for a while, just until
I get back from class? Please?

105
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,416
But I--

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,750
Hey!

107
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,333
She plays by her own rules.

108
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,875
I know. Sometimes you've
really got to admire her.

109
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Good morning!

110
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,250
Good morning!

111
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,458
So'd ya see it, ya see it?

112
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,916
I did, I did!

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,750
Critics rock!

114
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,000
Girls, keep it down back there!

115
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,583
Kalos wanted me to give you
a message. 'I understand that

116
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,958
the newspapers have
given your Godmother routine

117
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,541
a favorable review.

118
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:24,125
Keep in mind that your act is
far from perfect.' That's all.

119
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,166
Why didn't he just
tell us that in person?

120
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,791
Because Kalos is in Seattle
for a week for meetings

121
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,208
about our new production.

122
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,458
The new production?

123
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,041
Yeah, you know,

124
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,041
the show we're gonna do after
we finish running 'Cinderella.'

125
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,708
I heard that he starts planning
more than a year in advance.

126
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,916
Wow. That's a long time.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,583
But as for us, we've just gotta
keep giving good performances.

128
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,125
I think the three of us
should practice

129
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,833
the Triple Illusion again today.

130
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,208
Good idea!

131
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,750
Yeah! I'll make Kalos laugh
so hard he'll pass out!

132
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,916
Oh no you won't.

133
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,458
What-- What is that thing?
Get it away from me!

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh no, Jonathan.

135
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,500
Who?!

136
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,541
I found him at the beach.
I'm sorry if he frightened you.

137
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,041
I'm taking care
of him for a while.

138
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,166
Do you have rocks in your head?

139
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,250
No, I... He was hungry.
I couldn't just leave him.

140
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,833
You can barely keep up
with your duties as-is.

141
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,291
What makes you think you
can take care of a wild animal?

142
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,833
But Layla...

143
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,083
Take him back
to where you found him.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm sorry. I just took my
eyes off him for a second...

145
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,208
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

146
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,833
He never would've been
allowed on stage anyway.

147
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,375
Seems Kaleido Stage has
never had an animal act.

148
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,000
The stagehands say
that's just Kalos's policy.

149
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,958
Guess we should be glad all this
happened while he was away.

150
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,916
You can't keep him, Sora.

151
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,416
Yeah, but... he's still so tiny.
I'm afraid he won't make it

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,250
out there on his own.

153
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,333
He may be small,
but he sure can eat a lot.

154
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,500
You could never afford
to feed him, anyway.

155
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
But I'll be getting
performer's wages from now on.

156
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,541
And starting tomorrow
I'll get a part-time job.

157
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,875
What?!

158
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,291
But when would
you have the time?

159
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,333
You've still got lessons,
chores and being on stage.

160
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:23,666
Sora, you heard Kalos's message:
we all have to be in top-form.

161
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,833
I know that. And I
won't let you guys down.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,791
But after my parents died,
I was all by myself, too.

163
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,958
Sometimes I wonder where I would
be if no one had taken me in.

164
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,958
So you see, I cannot
just abandon him here.

165
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,083
I'm sorry. I know I...

166
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,833
I know I said I'd let
him go, but I can't.

167
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
He's my responsibility now.

168
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,583
Don't worry you guys,

169
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,125
I won't let Jonathan get
in the way of our stage work.

170
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,333
Thanks for letting me
use your bath.

171
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,458
It's no problem, really.
You sure you're gonna be okay?

172
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,583
Yeah! See you in the morning.

173
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,875
Good night.

174
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,333
I'm home!

175
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
So you like your pool?

176
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,625
I was afraid you'd feel
a claustrophobic...

177
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,625
You want claustrophobic?
Make him sleep in a drawer.

178
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,916
The beach, eh? She never
invites me to the beach...

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right, it'll
just be the two of us.

180
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,375
Unbelievable, she treats me
worse than her pet.

181
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,500
All right. That's it
for today's lesson.

182
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,500
--Tomorrow, we're going to --
--Thank you, sir!

183
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,625
Sora!

184
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,375
Hey!

185
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,958
And there she goes...

186
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,416
Thank you for waiting.
Now here's your Pirate Pizza.

187
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,708
Order. I need two Chef's
Specials with linguine

188
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,208
with Bolognese on the side, and
the main dishes are gonna be...

189
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,416
Signiorina, I have
your paycheck for you.

190
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh! Thank you so much!

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,458
I feel kind of strange
about paying you in fish--

192
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,541
are you sure you
wouldn't rather have cash?

193
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,583
No, he eats a lot of fish
so this really helps me out.

194
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,750
Well I guess I should be going.

195
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,791
I didn't know a person
could eat that much fish...

196
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,416
Here you go...

197
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,416
And that's the very last one.

198
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,416
How can you still be hungry?

199
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,291
Yeah!

200
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,125
Yeah!

201
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,458
Yeah!

202
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
That was great!

203
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,750
Thank you.

204
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,875
Our timing on the
cross-jump was perfect.

205
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,916
It's the best
we've ever done it.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,791
I wish Kalos
could have seen it today.

207
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,291
Yeah, we finally get it right
and he's not even here

208
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,791
to see it.

209
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Sora, you're not... you aren't
going to work after this,

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,708
are you?

211
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,250
Yeah.

212
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,291
You worked all week and haven't
given yourself a break yet.

213
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,833
You're pushing
yourself too hard.

214
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,625
Don't worry about me.

215
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,916
Not another one! Break one more
plate and you're fired, got it?

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,333
It won't happen again.

217
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,208
I don't have classes
or a show tomorrow.

218
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,833
I've just got to hang
in there a little longer...

219
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm home...

220
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,416
What was that noise?!

221
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,458
Sora!

222
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,250
I missed dinner, so I
guess I got a little --

223
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,541
That isn't funny, Sora.

224
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,208
Right.

225
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,250
Jump...

226
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,291
I told you you were
pushing yourself too hard.

227
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,666
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,291
What's this chart? This
isn't your schedule, is it?

229
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,041
No wonder you collapsed.

230
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,500
Jonathan eats a lot,
and it's like he's hungry

231
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,291
all the time now. I can't
just let him starve.

232
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,666
It looks like that's
all for right now.

233
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,125
First things first,
this has to go.

234
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,541
Hey!

235
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,916
You're not gonna give this up
no matter what we say.

236
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,541
So I guess that means
we have to help.

237
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,500
But, you guys--

238
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,833
It should be a piece of cake
if we all take turns.

239
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,083
How do we divide it up?

240
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,958
No, no, Jonathan is not
your problem, it's mine!

241
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,666
Hey listen. You're our partner
this is our problem, too.

242
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,000
But Mia...

243
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:08,875
Let's get to work.

244
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,250
Oh! I know what you could do!

245
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,083
A juggling contest?

246
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,791
That's right. It's a competition
they hold every year

247
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,625
at the stage down on the beach.

248
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,000
And the best jugglers come
from all over the world

249
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,416
just to show off their skills.

250
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Says here the contest
is three days away.

251
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,541
'Those wishing to enter
must register by 9 AM

252
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,375
on the day of the contest.'

253
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,916
Is this open to anyone?

254
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,166
I think so.

255
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,250
Amazing!

256
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,333
What is it?

257
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,166
The first prize
would buy enough fish

258
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,583
to feed Jonathan for a month.

259
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,958
Sounds like that
solves all our problems.

260
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,916
Oh. There's just one thing...

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What's the matter?

262
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,541
Is there something wrong?

263
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:53,166
It's just I've never
juggled before in my life.

264
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,833
Well, that's no big deal.

265
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
Anna's right, we still
have three whole days.

266
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,750
Really?

267
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,625
You think I could learn?

268
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,041
I don't see why not. Like they
say, 'When you've got nothing,

269
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,416
you've got nothing
to lose,' right?

270
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,208
Miss Sarah!

271
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
Uh. I mean, you'll do great.

272
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,916
We can teach you.

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,208
I'm ready.

274
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,541
What's this?
The Wheel of Fortune?

275
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,875
It foretells a
bringer of good luck.

276
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,125
It can't be... the seal?

277
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,916
Sora! I've got great news!

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,750
There's a juggling
contest coming up,

279
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,000
and if you win first prize
you'll be able to feed Jon-a--

280
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,625
You see? Easy as pie.

281
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,083
You'll be doing it
in no time, Sora.

282
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,416
Oh. Guess she heard
about it already.

283
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,125
I can't--

284
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,833
Faster! Come on!

285
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:05,000
If I can't do something
easy like this I--

286
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,833
Looks like this is gonna
be harder than we thought.

287
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,625
Did you know there used to be a
cast member here who was fired

288
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,166
when Kalos found out
she was keeping a dog?

289
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,458
Huh?!

290
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,375
My Dad says he's coming back
from Seattle soon.

291
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,291
He'll be here Monday morning.

292
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,750
Yay! That's awesome!
Good job, Jonathan!

293
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,375
You're more coordinated
than Sora is!

294
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,125
Not like that's so hard...

295
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:44,666
Oh. Just one more time.
Come on. Balance the ball.

296
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,708
Guess he only does it
when he feels like it.

297
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,458
I never knew that
a seal could be such a diva.

298
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,541
No doubt.

299
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,458
If Jonathan can do this,
then so can I!

300
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,916
It looks like it's time
to pull out Plan B.

301
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,541
This contest is really starting
to heat up, huh, folks?

302
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,416
Up next are some old favorites.

303
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,583
Please welcome
Mr. and Mrs. Pumpkin!

304
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,000
Those two really know
what they're doing...

305
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,375
They're okay, I guess.

306
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,916
It's gonna be tough for
Sora's team to beat them.

307
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,583
Kalos here. Yeah, I decided
to come back one day early.

308
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,916
Sora's what?

309
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,333
This is so tight!

310
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
It's the best I could find
on such short notice.

311
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,416
Remember: don't be late, Sora.

312
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,750
I know. Once you and Mia finish
your routine, then I'll start.

313
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,416
Anna. I thought we
agreed about that.

314
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,916
What?

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,750
Oh no that's us!

316
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,916
I thought it was never
gonna be their turn.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,708
I hope they do a good job.

318
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,083
Sora!

319
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,625
She blew it.

320
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,041
Oh no...

321
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,250
Hey!

322
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,125
What's wrong?

323
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,291
Stay still!

324
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
Huh?

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,208
Jonathan?

326
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,250
We've been saved by a seal.

327
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
Let's go.

328
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,833
Bravo, Jonathan!

329
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,125
Kalos!

330
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,291
I thought he wasn't supposed
to be back 'til tomorrow.

331
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,333
What can we do? He's seen us.

332
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,958
It's okay. I'll take the blame.

333
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,916
I don't allow anyone to take
part-time jobs or keep pets.

334
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,583
It draws your focus from the
show. I hope that's understood.

335
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,958
You can go now.

336
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,958
But it hasn't affected
my performance in the show.

337
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,583
In fact, when you
were gone we had a--

338
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,375
This matter's not
up for discussion.

339
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,083
I won't abandon him.

340
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,333
You won't.

341
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,333
I can't. He'd have
died without me.

342
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,583
Then I guess that means

343
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,916
you've made the decision
to quit Kaleido Stage.

344
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,875
I'm not quitting!

345
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,333
You're not?

346
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,000
What is it?

347
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,583
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but you have a guest.

348
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,541
I'll be with them shortly.
This conversation's over.

349
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,750
But you're not listening--!

350
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,291
That's enough, Sora.

351
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,833
My performance in the show has
nothing to do with Jonathan.

352
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,083
Listen, I'm only saying this
once more: the time you spend

353
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,291
taking care of that
seal is time you should be

354
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,875
spending in practice.
Understood?

355
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,875
But I've been practicing harder
than ever, and people have

356
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,958
been taking notice. And I know
you've seen the latest reviews.

357
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,708
Kaleido Stage is about making
people happy, but if that has to

358
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:15,375
come at Jonathan's expense, then
I can't help feeling there's

359
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,291
something really wrong with this
place. I can't say what's wrong

360
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:26,625
exactly it just feels wrong
to make a trade like that.

361
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,375
That's all.

362
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,125
Kalos?

363
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,833
Jean?

364
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,291
Jonathan... Everyone...

365
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,916
Kalos I remember very well why
you let Sora join Kaleido Stage

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,833
in the first place.

367
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,791
I've regretted it ever since.

368
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,208
How about this:

369
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,041
why don't we keep the seal
as a sort of company mascot?

370
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,750
Then Sora will be able to quit
her part-time jobs and you won't

371
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,208
have to worry about it affecting
her stage work adversely.

372
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,333
Oh fine, just take
care of it, Jean.

373
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,250
First thing we'll do is build
a giant swimming pool for him,

374
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,500
okay?

375
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,916
Thank you, Dad.

376
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,500
Sora, I can't believe
he's letting you keep him!

377
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,041
All right!

378
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,750
Thank you very much, sir!

379
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,166
We did it!

380
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,958
Isn't that great, Jonathan?

381
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,000
The audiences here

382
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,041
are too stupid to
appreciate my performances.

383
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,541
And so the diabolo
world-champion, Rosetta,

384
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,541
joined our show.

385
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,583
Amazing...

386
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,583
Guess that's why
she's a champion...

387
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,791
But she always seems so sad. How
can she make an audience happy

388
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,250
if she's not
really happy herself?

389
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,291
That's why I want
to make Rosetta smile,

390
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,208
whatever it takes.

391
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,791
And I'll do it, I'll do it!

392
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,041
Next time on Kaleido Star, 'The
Amazing Girl Who Doesn't Smile.'

393
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,791
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
