1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,458
Take a seat everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,125
so make sure
your room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,958
and don't sit too
close to the TV.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,000
You got that?

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,625
Okay then, let's go!

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,458
Well, well, well,
I'm back again everyone!

7
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,458
You see, I remember
the reason that I've

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,416
always loved the Kaleido Stage.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,125
Oh, and I remembered
my personal policy:

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,333
there's nothing
I can't do if I try.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,083
And if I can do
it without trying,

12
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,291
well then I'm just super lucky.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,333
I'm gonna do this.

14
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,625
I gotta do this!

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,083
This time I'll dig
deep inside myself and

16
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,333
I'll become a real Kaleido Star!

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,166
I will!

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,541
I will!

19
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,166
I'm really sorry boss.

20
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,291
Understand that even
if you come back,

21
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,458
there's nothing for
you to do onstage.

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,000
I've terminated your contract.

23
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm afraid I had no choice.

24
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,125
Yes, I understand sir.

25
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,291
But if you let me come back,

26
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,291
I promise I'll do
anything you want.

27
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,458
You don't even have to pay me.

28
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,625
I love the Kaleido
Stage with all my heart.

29
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,125
Please boss.

30
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,125
If you don't mind
working as an unpaid gofer,

31
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,583
I've got no reason to stop you.

32
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,125
Do what you want.

33
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,833
Thank you boss,
you won't regret it!

34
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,583
This is just like the
first time I went to the

35
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,250
Kaleido Stage for my audition.

36
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,083
It's a fresh start from zero.

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,916
But back then my only dream
was to become a Kaleido Star.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,791
This time, it's to create a show
that everyone can enjoy.

39
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,041
A show with no competition.

40
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,291
It will take time.

41
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,958
But eventually I will
become a Kaleido Star.

42
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,958
I just know it.

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,708
Would you like tea or coffee?

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,208
She's asking if you'd
like some tea, dear.

45
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,291
Forget tea,
how about a cocktail...

46
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,041
What?

47
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,208
How rude.

48
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,125
Oh, no, thank you miss,
I'm fine, really!

49
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,208
You're awfully young to be

50
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,833
travelling by
yourself, young lady.

51
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,291
Uh, well yeah,

52
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,875
but I've got a lot of friends
in the United States.

53
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:46,833
Oh really?

54
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,333
That's nice.

55
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,458
Friends are such an important
part of life, aren't they?

56
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,625
You're right, they're important

57
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,166
and they're really
really really great!

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,500
That's right, I'm
not starting from zero.

59
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,958
I've got everyone with me now.

60
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,000
My Amazing Fresh Start.

61
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,416
Welcome back!

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,750
I'm over here Sora!

63
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,041
Mr. Policeman!

64
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,208
Oh Sora, you made
it back, I'm so happy.

65
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,333
I can't breathe!

66
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,833
I don't understand
these young people.

67
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,958
Oh, sorry.

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,541
I'm just so glad to see ya.

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,041
Thanks for coming to pick
me up Mr. Policeman!

70
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,708
Everyone's waiting for you
to get back home Sora.

71
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,583
Really?

72
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,666
I can't wait to see them all!

73
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,958
So you see, because of
everything that happened,

74
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,958
I realized that I really
really love Kaleido Stage,

75
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,541
and that I belong there!

76
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,875
Hold on Sora.

77
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,458
You should wait and
say that in front

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,166
of everyone
that's waiting for you.

79
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,958
Yeah, you're right.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,625
Want some candy?

81
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, thanks!

82
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,333
You know, I wanna create a
Kaleido Stage show where

83
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,458
the audience and the cast
can all enjoy themselves.

84
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,541
I like to make people smile.

85
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,625
That's my Sora!

86
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,291
Welcome back Sora!

87
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,125
Uh, hello everyone.

88
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,958
We missed you Sora!

89
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,625
Oh Sora, you had me
really worried you know.

90
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,416
I'm so sorry Rosetta.

91
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,125
I was so afraid that you
were never coming back.

92
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,708
And thank you Ken,
for coming to Japan.

93
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,166
What?!

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,791
You went to Japan?

95
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,583
I didn't go alone,
I was with Mr. Policeman.

96
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,625
That's not fair.

97
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,958
Then where's our souvenirs?

98
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,458
Oh that's right, I've got
souvenirs for you guys.

99
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,166
For Miss Sara,
a Ninja Transformation kit.

100
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,750
For Mia, a good-luck charm.

101
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,458
It's so cute, thank you!

102
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,750
For Marion and
Jonathan, hago paddles.

103
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,500
Oh wow!

104
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,166
For Ken, a globe!

105
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,375
Why a globe?

106
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,041
For Anna, a jester's
mask and a paper fan.

107
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,125
Woah.

108
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,291
Sora, this thing's
got a scary face.

109
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
That's a Japanese lion.

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,083
Huh, it's a lion?

111
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,708
Hey Marion,
she says it's a lion!

112
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,375
Hey Sora, is everything okay?

113
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,666
Are you gonna be alright?

114
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,666
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,958
I didn't mean to
make anyone worry.

116
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,166
I really couldn't
be happier to be back,

117
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,916
and I won't give up
on my dream ever again.

118
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,916
I'm so glad to hear
that from you Sora.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,833
I wonder why she
gave me a globe.

120
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:36,958
You'll only use that thing

121
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,333
two or three times
in your entire life.

122
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,791
So how about it?

123
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
I give you this!

124
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
You'll be the fool,

125
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,958
and I'll be the straight man,
this'll be great!

126
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,500
How many times have I told you,

127
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not pairing up
with you Anna!

128
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

129
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,333
But why not?

130
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,458
Bloodlust!

131
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,708
I sense bloodlust!

132
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,916
You villain!

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,125
May!

134
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
May?

135
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,958
I can't hear a
thing she's saying.

136
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,916
Uh oh.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,541
Now she's barking.

138
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,208
Wow, this glass
certainly is soundproof.

139
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,416
She's coming in.

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,541
Galaxy Warp Seven.

141
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,083
Congratulations on winning
the Circus Festival, May!

142
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,541
What are you doing here?

143
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,625
Give it a rest May.

144
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,583
Even though her contract's been
terminated, Sora's one of us.

145
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,208
Yeah, can't you at least
say "welcome back"?

146
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,083
She's not welcome here.

147
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,875
She can't even perform onstage,

148
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,916
and there's no room
for her in the dormitory.

149
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,125
No room?

150
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,916
We were going to tell you that
after our little party, Sora.

151
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,166
It's okay.

152
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,250
Oh, that makes sense.

153
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,583
You can stay in
my room, I don't mind.

154
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,750
You shouldn't be wasting your

155
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,833
time at some
stupid little party.

156
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,708
Hurry up and go talk
to the boss already.

157
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,375
You should talk to him, and see
if he'll let you back onstage.

158
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:52,291
Because as far as I'm concerned,
the festival isn't over yet.

159
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,541
May...

160
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,583
So basically you want
Sora to be back onstage?

161
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,416
Why didn't you just
come out and say that?

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,291
I just wanna beat
Sora once and for all!

163
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,750
Thank you very much.

164
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,083
But I'm fine with
the way things are.

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,791
But Sora...

166
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,500
What are you saying?

167
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,041
I decided that I don't
wanna compete anymore.

168
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,666
I don't like it.

169
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,250
Are you saying you
don't wanna be onstage?

170
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,166
No, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

171
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,583
I love the stage.

172
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,500
I hope that someday soon
I'll be back on stage again.

173
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,750
I just don't like
to compete on stage.

174
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,458
I wanna work
with everyone and try

175
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,250
and to create a show that's
fun with no competition.

176
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,625
That's my dream.

177
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,708
You're so stupid!

178
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,583
Well?

179
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,291
Okay Sora.

180
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,250
I'll be working for
you from now on.

181
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,750
So if you ever need anything,
please just give me a yell!

182
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,250
Good luck!

183
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,083
Okay everybody, I want you
to stay on top of things today.

184
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,500
I want you all to give it
everything you've got

185
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,833
during the Demon Spiral,

186
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,291
and in any scenes with
me and Leon in them.

187
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,833
Do I make myself clear?

188
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,416
Yes.

189
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,250
You know I really wish that Sora
could be back on stage with us.

190
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,083
Sora made this
decision on her own,

191
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,875
so the only thing we
can do now is support her.

192
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,208
I got it, I got it!

193
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,250
Sora!

194
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,500
I guess it was a
little too heavy for me.

195
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,625
Can someone deliver
these costumes for me?

196
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,791
I can, I can!

197
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,458
Sorry to make you do this Sora.

198
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,541
No problem!

199
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,208
This one needs
to go to entrance 3B,

200
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,083
and this one goes
to entrance 2C.

201
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,750
Yeah, I got it!

202
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,500
It's Leon and May
as Romeo and Juliet.

203
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,083
Right now, the Kaleido Stage
belongs to May and Leon.

204
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,541
I'll leave your
costume here, okay?

205
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,333
Thank you Sora.

206
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,875
I thought I had prepared
myself for this, but...

207
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,000
But in the end...I'm
jealous of May

208
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,541
and the applause
that she's receiving.

209
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,000
I kinda feel bad
asking you to do this.

210
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,166
Its okay, I'm having fun.

211
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,958
I get to see the
behind the scenes stuff

212
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,458
that I never got to see before.

213
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,375
And well, I'd love
to learn everything

214
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,000
I can about Kaleido Stage.

215
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,125
Man, you're head over heels for
Kaleido Stage, aren't you Sora.

216
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,583
Yeah I am Vince!

217
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,458
I love it more
and more every day!

218
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,625
Leon, I've been
looking all over for you.

219
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,541
I told the lighting guys
to be more careful

220
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,291
and to quit messing up.

221
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,791
Leon?

222
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
Sora?

223
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,708
Leon was watching Sora.

224
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,541
But why?

225
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,625
Whoa, it's green!

226
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,291
It's Japanese tea.

227
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,916
Oh.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,125
Go ahead and sit down.

229
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,750
You may not like it,
but I hope that you do.

230
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
I'll drink a little,
but I don't know...

231
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,125
You won't know until you try.

232
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,541
Give it a taste.

233
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,500
It's bitter!

234
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,708
Well it's pretty good stuff
once you get used to it.

235
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,625
Sora?

236
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,333
Well I...I guess that
I still don't really

237
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,333
understand why you're so
against competing on stage.

238
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,208
I don't...get it.

239
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,958
I mean I'm proud of the
time that I was aiming

240
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,875
to win two consecutive
world championships.

241
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,083
But after listening to you, I
wonder if it's bad to compete.

242
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,333
No, no, no!

243
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,125
That's not what I meant at all!

244
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,166
But you...

245
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,666
Rosetta you're
absolutely amazing,

246
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,458
and May was fantastic
when she won the festival.

247
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,958
It's just that I've
figured out that

248
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,541
competing isn't my
dream, that's all.

249
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,583
Is it okay if
my dream is to

250
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,708
perform on stage with you Sora?

251
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,916
Of course!

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,125
I'm definitely gonna
be back on stage soon.

253
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,666
And I would love to have the
opportunity to perform with you!

254
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,750
Sora.

255
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,375
If you want some
more tea, I'll make it for you.

256
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,416
No, that's okay!

257
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,291
It's time to wake
up you sleepyhead.

258
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,375
Little girl it's time
to roll out of bed.

259
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm a fearsome lion, sent to
wake you from your slumber.

260
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,250
Good morning to you Sora.

261
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,625
Fool, what are you doing?

262
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,083
You're the one who
asked me to wake you up

263
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,250
quietly so that Rosetta
wouldn't be disturbed.

264
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,750
That's right, I've got
cleaning duty this morning.

265
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,625
While you're gone I'll just
cuddle with Rosetta and...

266
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,333
Sora, I have
something to tell you!

267
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,916
It's Layla, Layla's coming!

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,458
Lying about Miss Layla?

269
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,791
That's a new low, Fool!

270
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,083
No, no, it's true!

271
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,916
I'm sorry I didn't
get to tell you earlier,

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
but according to
my crystal ball

273
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,791
Layla's constellation,
the Lion, is nearby!

274
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,750
I'll be honest with you;

275
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,375
yesterday's
performance was boring.

276
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,083
I didn't feel a thing for
any of those characters.

277
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,583
While the individual stunts
may be attention-grabbing,

278
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,041
the show itself just
isn't coherent.

279
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,416
Right.

280
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,291
It's like a bunch of one-man
shows pieced together.

281
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,958
Mia, you're the director, so why
don't you give us your opinion.

282
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,125
Mia, this is Cathy Timor.

283
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,541
She's a well-known
off-Broadway director.

284
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,500
Well, this isn't really my area
of expertise, but I have no

285
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,125
problem telling you exactly
what I thought of the show.

286
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,791
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,125
I think Miss Cathy
is absolutely right.

288
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,416
I just couldn't get anything to
go the way that I wanted it to.

289
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,458
It's my fault.

290
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,458
It's all my fault.

291
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,250
I'm so sorry!

292
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,666
Am I fired?

293
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
I'm fired, aren't I?

294
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,541
I mean, why else
would Miss Cathy be here?

295
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,958
I understand.

296
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,125
Now that was interesting.

297
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,666
You've got talent Mia.

298
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,500
Here's what impressed
me about the show.

299
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,750
That "Demon Spiral"?

300
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,291
That's what it's called, right?

301
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
Making that work in Romeo and
Juliet is not a bad concept.

302
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,250
And I think the character
adaptations are pretty chic.

303
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,666
All in all, I think you've
got a good setup.

304
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,500
The problem is
your directing ability.

305
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
So far audience
attendance hasn't dropped,

306
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,333
but our demographics are all
over the place.

307
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,833
I'd really like your help
to correct that trend.

308
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,833
Consider it done, you got it!

309
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,166
Well since that's settled,
let's get going Mia.

310
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,166
Huh?

311
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,500
Don't "huh" me.

312
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,125
I'm still an outsider,
so you're gonna have to

313
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,708
help me get the job done, okay?

314
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,791
Uh, sure!

315
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,333
Ugh, that's no good at all!

316
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,125
Leon, May, your timing was
completely wrong just then.

317
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,583
Why were you both so off?

318
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,875
Well, um, you see, that's
because May can't get

319
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,541
very much height, and so
when Mr. Leon compensates

320
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,500
his maneuvers end up
looking smaller.

321
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,750
It's just something...

322
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,791
But that's not the
audience's problem, is it?

323
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,291
Leon, May, come here a minute.

324
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,166
Look Leon, I get that your

325
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,291
skills are amazing
and everything.

326
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,833
It's just that I wanna feel more
emotion from your performance.

327
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,500
May, your performance in
New York made my heart pound,

328
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,458
but I'm not feeling
anything from you today.

329
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,750
So we've got a Romeo
who's satisfied being

330
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
technically correct,
and a Juliet

331
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,000
who isn't willing to take risks.

332
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,750
That's never going to get
your audience excited.

333
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,750
Don't underestimate them.

334
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,250
Go ahead and take five.

335
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,708
Wow, she's so cool!

336
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,791
Did you find her?

337
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,708
No, I've looked everywhere.

338
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,875
She said she had cleaning
duty this morning.

339
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,541
We've got to find her
while Miss Layla's here.

340
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,000
Look there!

341
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,916
Oh, hi everyone!

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,208
What are you doing?

343
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,541
What's it look like,
I'm wiping windows.

344
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
This part was smudged
and it bugged me,

345
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,625
so I came up here to clean it.

346
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,666
Forget about the window,
Miss Layla's here!

347
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,833
Sora!

348
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,666
Well that's a surprise.

349
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,083
Come on Sora, hurry!

350
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,458
Layla brought a lady from
Broadway named Cathy.

351
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,583
Miss Cathy too?

352
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,458
Maybe I shouldn't go,
I mean at the festival she...

353
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,958
I'm disappointed in you Sora.

354
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:10,500
So, after what she said, I don't
know if I can face Miss Layla.

355
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,958
Sora!

356
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,666
Why are you so hesitant
about every little thing?

357
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,041
That's not the Sora I know!

358
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,625
My Sora doesn't stop
to think, she just acts.

359
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,916
Or do you wanna go your whole

360
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,041
life without seeing
Miss Layla again?

361
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,625
Rosetta?

362
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,625
Let's go!

363
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey, maybe there's
a chance they'll

364
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,208
put you on stage again Sora!

365
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,291
A chance to be back on stage?

366
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,541
But...

367
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,000
Could you play it
back for us please?

368
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,916
Yes ma'am Miss Layla.

369
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,500
You've gotta know what
I'm talking about May.

370
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,083
What is it with this
listless performance?

371
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,708
For example, look at that.

372
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,500
Can you show us that
segment one more time please?

373
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,500
Just rewind thirty seconds.

374
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,916
Okay.

375
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,041
The two of you aren't even
trying to look at each other.

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,208
I've never seen two
lovers look less enamored.

377
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,333
Rosetta, wait!

378
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,708
Oh just come on Sora!

379
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,541
But can't I just take a
quick look from here?

380
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,875
Oh hi!

381
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,375
Sora?!

382
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,333
What are you doing here?

383
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,083
Hey, check it out, it's Sora!

384
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,416
Sora, come on down here!

385
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,208
I'd like to see
you give Juliet a shot.

386
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,500
I know you're not
contracted anymore,

387
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,708
but just come give it a try.

388
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,416
Leon.

389
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,833
Isn't it great Sora?

390
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,916
Here's your chance
to be on stage!

391
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,708
Sora.

392
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,875
Even if you want to avoid
competition, it looks like the

393
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,333
people around you aren't
going to let it happen.

394
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,875
Kalos hasn't said anything to
stop you from trying it.

395
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,250
Come on, what's the matter?

396
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,500
Go ahead Sora, let's see it.

397
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,750
Let's see your Juliet!

398
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,625
I can't do it.

399
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,041
I'm sorry, but the role of
Juliet belongs to May.

400
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,416
What's wrong with you?!

401
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,958
Why won't you even try?!

402
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,958
Why do you keep running
away from competition?

403
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,583
You coward!

404
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,500
May!

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,916
Sora!

406
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,166
Yes?

407
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,500
I think you should take
some time and think how

408
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,958
your refusal to compete
just now has affected May.

409
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,791
Sometimes you can hurt someone
just as much by not fighting.

410
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,625
Good work today!

411
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,125
Thanks, you too!

412
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,291
Listen, don't let what
happened today get you down.

413
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,541
'kay.

414
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,125
Sora you cheer everyone
up just by being around,

415
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,166
whether you're on stage or off.

416
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,416
I think you should keep
doing what you think is right.

417
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,916
Ken, thank you.

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,875
Thank you for everything!

419
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,791
Hey Ken, you coming or what?

420
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,500
Yeah!

421
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,333
See you tomorrow.

422
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,166
Right.

423
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,250
Good work today!

424
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,583
Well Ken, thanks again.

425
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,250
Leon...

426
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,000
Leon?

427
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,833
Was I mistaken?

428
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,041
I thought that you wanted
to become my partner.

429
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,875
I did, but now I have a
different dream.

430
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,916
I think that you and I
have different goals now.

431
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,458
My dreams of a fun new
Kaleido Stage without

432
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,916
competition may
seem like a fantasy.

433
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,250
But I'm gonna try
to turn it into reality,

434
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
no matter how hard
I have to work!

435
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,625
What if I made you
become my partner?

436
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,833
Hey, let me go,
stop, you're hurting me!

437
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,250
Are you the one?

438
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,208
Are you the one that
can become my partner?

439
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,041
Please stop!

440
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,208
No, let me go!

441
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,708
You are the one
who reminds me of her.

442
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,708
Sophie!

443
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,416
Sophie!

444
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,291
Leon!

445
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,666
Leon!

446
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,833
I...I can't breathe, Leon.

447
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,333
Leon?

448
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:16,166
Sophie, I'm so
happy you're alright.

449
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,416
Leon, I'm Sora, remember?

450
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,125
So you are the one...after all.

451
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,875
Leon!

452
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,625
Why?

453
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,958
Why did he call Sora "Sophie"?

454
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:38,125
I don't get it...who's "Sophie"?

455
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,541
The only one who can become
my partner is Sora Naegino.

456
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,291
My dream is to have a
show without competition.

457
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,375
Sophie.

458
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,583
What is wrong with you?!

459
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,750
Unexpected incidents
and horrible accidents.

460
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:16,125
Oh, and a present that
makes me really, really happy!

461
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,625
Just watch and you'll see.

462
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,250
You will, you will!

463
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,708
Next time on Kaleido Star:

464
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,666
"An Amazingly
Humiliating Performance."

465
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,166
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
