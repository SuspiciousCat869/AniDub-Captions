1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,250
Hello, everyone,
Kaleido Star is about to start.

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,458
Please make sure the
room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,666
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV, okay?

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,250
Well, well, well...

5
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,000
Doesn't it make you nervous
sometimes when you go someplace

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,791
you've never been before?

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,083
A place where
everything seems foreign,

8
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,791
and you don't know what to do?

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,500
A place where everyone gets mad
at you just because you're new?!

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,375
I can't take it anymore! Okay,
just breathe, just breathe...

11
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,916
Good show, everybody!

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,125
Oh! Great it's vacation time!

13
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,250
I almost don't know what to do
with a full week of free time.

14
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,125
What do you think about
taking a trip someplace?

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,000
Man you've got a lot of energy.

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,166
I just wanna sit on the beach.

17
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh, that sounds nice...

18
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,041
The beach?

19
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,708
Not me, I wanna go someplace
I've never even heard of before

20
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,833
and then cut loose!

21
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,041
And I'll--

22
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,416
Sora.

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,166
Uh? What is it, Boss?

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,333
Here you go.

25
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,916
Is this an airline ticket?

26
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,625
Oh my gosh, Boss, are you
rewarding all my hard work

27
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,125
by giving me a trip
someplace exotic?

28
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,375
Thank you, thank you!

29
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,250
That's great!

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,791
Looks like you got your wish.

31
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:19,875
It's work.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,250
A dirty trick...

33
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,333
On the bright side,
at least you get to travel.

34
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,500
My friend Mr. Pack runs
a circus, and he's asked

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,166
to have you come
as a guest performer.

36
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,041
Stay calm... oh I don't
know if I can do this...

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,041
This card foretells
an ordeal. A sacrifice.

38
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,083
'Mysterious Amazing Circus.'

39
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,625
Kalos wanted you to have a
manager with you on this trip.

40
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,208
So that's why I'm here.

41
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:07,000
Right. Oh, Ken, I'm so glad I'll
have somebody I know with me!

42
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:11,083
Wow. Life can be
pretty good sometimes.

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,666
The place we're going
is called Theatrical Camp.

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,875
Theatrical Camp?

45
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,375
It's a mobile circus.

46
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,875
And they specialize in different
things than Kaleido Stage,

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,375
like knife-throwing,
fire-breathing, whip tricks

48
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,833
and keg juggling.

49
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,875
I see... So, should I start
practicing fire breathing?

50
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,708
I don't think so...

51
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,833
Strangers!

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,958
Ken...

53
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,583
Hey. Don't worry, I'll find out
where we're supposed to be.

54
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,250
This way.

55
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,416
We've been expecting you.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,541
Pleased to meet you,
Miss Naegino.

57
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,458
Theatrical Camp welcomes you.

58
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,250
Wow, she's really
breathing fire!

59
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,833
Here you go!

60
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,375
Excuse me!

61
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
It's like the audience
is part of the show.

62
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,458
Hey, no fair, Milo!

63
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,833
I didn't do anything!

64
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,791
Why'd you eat that?
You knew it was mine!

65
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,500
Tank, how many times
do I have to tell you?

66
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,833
Get out of my ring when
you're done with your kegs!

67
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,625
But the kids were so happy...

68
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,916
Don't do it again!

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,291
Whatever you say...

70
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,125
Excuse me...

71
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
Don't look at me like that.

72
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,375
Wait!

73
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,625
I didn't do it!

74
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,750
Then why are you running?

75
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,833
Because you're chasing me!

76
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,041
Hello?!

77
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,416
I see you've all met our guest.
This is Miss Sora Naegino.

78
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,541
Kalos from Kaleido Stage sent
me. It's nice to meet you all.

79
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,708
Uh, and I'm Sora's
manager. Ken Robbins.

80
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,541
Kaleido Stage, huh?

81
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,833
Enjoy everyone!

82
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,833
I don't like to brag, but
today's stew is delicious!

83
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,541
Yay! Food!

84
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,208
As for tomorrow's performance,
I was thinking we'd do

85
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,666
that piece we
haven't done in a while.

86
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,291
Since we have a guest and all.

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,708
Sora, I'd like for you
to be the lead, a princess.

88
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,583
The lead role?!

89
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,291
Yes.

90
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,375
Yeah!

91
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,375
And in tomorrow's performance?

92
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,416
I don't know if
I can do it, Mr. Pack...

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
She's not even gonna try.

94
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,041
Maybe she just flat-out
isn't good enough.

95
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,541
Well, I guess I can
give it my best shot.

96
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,041
Oh, what's the use?
It's impossible.

97
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,333
The story itself
is very simple.

98
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,208
You'll be playing
a princess who has to rescue

99
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,750
her little twin sisters
from an evil sorceress.

100
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,250
Okay.

101
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,833
Dominique, the twins just
threw their carrots away again.

102
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:40,041
So I guess that means
you guys need a refill. Eat up.

103
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,541
Pamela, you'll be
playing the sorceress.

104
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,000
Right.

105
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,041
Tank, you'll be the glutton
with super-human strength.

106
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,458
I gotcha.

107
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,708
The princess will fight against
a knife-wielding monster

108
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,875
before making her way
to the witch's lair.

109
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,958
Uh, Pack. You've
forgotten my part.

110
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:05,250
Ah yes, Dio. Your character
is the princess's only ally.

111
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,500
They work together
to rescue the twins,

112
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,791
falling in love along the way.

113
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,333
A happy ending, no?

114
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,291
Nice to meet you.

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,708
Oh! It's nice to meet you, too!

116
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,833
The love story part
sounds unnecessary to me...

117
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,500
There there.

118
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,541
Could you give him
some milk please?

119
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,833
Sure.

120
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,500
Chocolate.

121
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,791
Eclair.

122
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,208
Radio station.

123
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:31,875
Noodle.

124
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,916
Elephant.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,250
This script
talks about the story,

126
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,291
but doesn't have any
information on my routines.

127
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,541
I wonder what I'll be doing.

128
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:44,291
At any rate, I guess I'd better
get some sleep before tomorrow.

129
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,541
You're cheating!

130
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,375
Me cheating, you're
the one who's cheating,

131
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,208
you're always cheating!

132
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't sleep!

133
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,666
Ken?

134
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,166
Sora. Did you come out
to look at the stars?

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,666
They're beautiful. Ken?

136
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,916
Yeah?

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,583
Thank you for being so great.

138
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,125
For what now?

139
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,083
I mean, every time I'm
not sure I can do something,

140
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,958
you're always there
helping me and cheering me on.

141
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,875
Without you, I never would
have found my Little Mermaid.

142
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
And I never would have
made it through the audition

143
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,125
for Arabian Nights.

144
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,791
Uh, I don't
know about that, Sora.

145
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,083
You succeeded
because you worked hard.

146
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,416
I don't think that's true.

147
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Of course it is.
You're a hard worker.

148
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,708
Sometimes I think
you work too hard,

149
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,000
and you're going places where
I won't be able to follow you.

150
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,166
Huh?

151
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,416
You must be tired. Maybe you
should try to go get some sleep.

152
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,083
Well... it's kinda
noisy in there...

153
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
Really?

154
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,250
But you're right, I should
probably get back inside.

155
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,583
Yeah, I guess so.

156
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,125
You never know,
maybe they've quieted down.

157
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
See you in the morning!

158
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,916
Okay.

159
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,375
That baby cried all night long.

160
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,666
Really? I couldn't hear
anything over Tank's snoring.

161
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,916
There's nobody here.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,583
The men aren't
in their quarters, either.

163
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,666
Then what are we
going to do about rehearsal?

164
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,125
Oh, there's not going to be
any rehearsal, sweetie.

165
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,416
You-- you're kidding, right?

166
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,583
Afraid not. These folks
just don't go in for that.

167
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,916
Uh. You don't happen
to know where they went?

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,833
Oh, baby,
this is their free time.

169
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,791
They're scattered to the winds.

170
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,791
It's coming
from the stage area.

171
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,250
It's Dio!

172
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm so glad! I thought everybody
had gone off and left me.

173
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,625
I'll bet everyone else
is out sightseeing. Huh.

174
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,416
I guess I should probably
get out of here and go do

175
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,875
some of that myself.
See ya later.

176
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,250
Oh, wait a minute!

177
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,125
You mean you guys
really don't rehearse at all?!

178
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,125
I -- I've never performed
without a rehearsal!

179
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,708
That's too bad.

180
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,791
Look, Sora, is it okay if I give
you a little piece of advice?

181
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,333
Yes.

182
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,541
When you watched the show
yesterday I'm sure you saw

183
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,291
that each member of the troupe
has their own specialty.

184
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,458
The story's just there so we
can show off what we do best.

185
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,791
If you just pay attention

186
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,291
to the audience's reaction
you'll know what to do.

187
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,458
Follow the
audience's reaction...

188
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:39,458
Right. Just show them what
they wanna see. Just relax.

189
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,500
Thanks for the advice, Dio.
Show what I do best...

190
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,916
Princess, if you ever want to
see your little sisters again,

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,916
come to my castle and
we'll see who is stronger!

192
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,750
Help us!

193
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,041
Uh... I wonder if that
was my cue. Should I go on?

194
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,458
I can't tell...

195
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,500
It's you! Go!

196
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,458
You're the leading lady.
You've got to act like it!

197
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,916
Mila, Milo, where have you run
off to? I hope that the witch--

198
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,958
I wasn't finished
with my line...

199
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,791
Sora...

200
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,750
Looks like everything's
going smoothly.

201
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you mean?

202
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,416
Hey! What are
you doi--?! Stop it!

203
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,291
Oh, there's my beer kegs!

204
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,583
It's high time we see
just how brave this princess is!

205
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,375
Now stay still, okay?

206
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,291
If you're looking for me,
I'm right here, Princess!

207
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,750
I've got to show them
what I can do.

208
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,083
Here I go.

209
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,416
You're nothing.

210
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,333
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves, Mr. Pack.

211
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,500
If this is how Sora's
going to be treated,

212
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,666
there's no way I'm going to let
her appear on your stage again.

213
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,833
Well, if that's how Sora

214
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,500
feels there's
nothing I can do about it.

215
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,208
They think putting someone
in danger's entertainment.

216
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,791
I just don't
understand these people.

217
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,291
If you want to leave
I'll explain everything

218
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,458
to Kalos for you.

219
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,916
I don't care if they
make fun of my mistakes.

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But that's not
what they were doing.

221
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,708
They were making fun of me
because I'm an outsider.

222
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,708
Yesterday's performance
I thought it was amazing how

223
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,208
the audience and cast seemed
to be working together

224
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,625
to make the show.

225
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,875
But today it seemed like
everyone was just trying

226
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,333
to humiliate me.

227
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,166
I mean, they didn't
even let me perform.

228
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,875
Is this about Pamela?

229
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,333
How did you know?

230
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,708
It was awful what
she did to you up there.

231
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,791
But did you happen to
notice what she was doing

232
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,541
before you grabbed the trapeze?

233
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,750
I know you didn't mean to,

234
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,250
Sora, but you stole
her biggest moment.

235
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,541
That's why...?

236
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:52,041
I see. Dio, thanks
so much for telling me.

237
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,958
Oh, go to sleep already.

238
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,416
What do you want?

239
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,541
I'm sorry I ruined
your big moment.

240
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,833
I'll bet you're ready to go
running back home after today.

241
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,375
This isn't like Kaleido Stage,

242
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,333
where all you have to do is
follow a script to get applause.

243
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,750
A monkey could do that.

244
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,375
You don't know anything
about Kaleido Stage.

245
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,333
And I'm not about
to leave here.

246
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,750
Really?

247
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,541
As long as I'm
performing with your troupe,

248
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,250
I expect you to treat me
as a member of your company.

249
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,833
That means when I jump
tomorrow you're gonna catch me.

250
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,875
If I feel like it.

251
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,916
Look at this, it's a fool.

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,333
You!

253
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,750
It's just as I'd feared:
you've been too tossed around

254
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,208
by the storms of life
to even say hello.

255
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,458
What the heck
are you doing here?

256
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,291
Oh. I stay locked away in your
suitcase for days just because

257
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,666
I know you're going to need
my expert guidance and this

258
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,166
is the kind of
thanks I get? Hm?

259
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,416
I'm glad you're here.

260
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
You've got hands
like a dock worker.

261
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,708
Maybe you're in
the wrong line of work.

262
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,208
I, uh thought I saw a roach.

263
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,291
First, we should talk about
the performance space, I guess.

264
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,791
Right.

265
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,791
They want to fit as many seats
as they can into the tent.

266
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,791
So the stage is gonna be small.

267
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,291
And the audience is going to be
a lot closer to the performers

268
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,083
here than they would be
at Kaleido Stage.

269
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
That means they can see
your facial expressions

270
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,875
when you're performing.

271
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,625
You're right.

272
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
So doing my routines from
Kaleido Stage won't impress

273
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,000
the audiences here.

274
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,291
I have to pay attention to
what everyone else is doing

275
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,458
when they perform and follow
the audience's response.

276
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,958
Unless I can do that,

277
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,208
they'll never treat me
like one of the company.

278
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,666
Princess, if you ever want to
see your little sisters again,

279
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,958
come to my castle and
we'll see who is stronger!

280
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,166
Help us!

281
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:11,916
You're on!

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,916
Right!

283
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,500
Mila, Milo? Where did
you two wander off to?

284
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,708
Did the witch kidnap them?

285
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,083
I'm the only one
who can rescue them!

286
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,166
Don't be afraid,
little sisters.

287
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,166
I'll find you! Huh?
What did I do wrong?

288
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,916
Yeah!

289
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,875
Hey, quit it!

290
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,458
I know!

291
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,875
Oh! My kegs!

292
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,083
Thank you, thank you!

293
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,000
Maybe I can do this after all.

294
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,166
Ready?

295
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,125
That's a smaller target
than I'm used to...

296
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,750
Yeah!

297
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,250
Not too shabby.

298
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,166
If you're looking for me,
I'm right here, Princess!

299
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,291
I'll show you what it takes to
be a leading lady around here.

300
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,000
No that's too high!

301
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,083
Amazing...

302
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,250
You're incredible, Pamela.

303
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,208
I've never seen anyone jump
that high on the swings before.

304
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,666
I'm glad you caught me
on a good day--

305
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,000
I can only pull it off
one in every five tries.

306
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,166
But I didn't want you
to outdo me up there.

307
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,791
There's no way I could...

308
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,000
Sora, Theatrical Camp isn't
about doing difficult maneuvers,

309
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,625
it's about performing.

310
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,583
The most important thing
is to take care of yourself

311
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,583
so you can keep
showing up on stage.

312
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,500
Working here's so
different from Kaleido Stage.

313
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,333
I don't know how you guys
do it day after day,

314
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,291
creating a new show every
time for each audience.

315
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,541
That's what I thought, too,

316
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,333
when I first came here
from Kaleido Stage.

317
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,166
But now I really like
the way we do things here.

318
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,958
I'm not afraid
to try new things.

319
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,875
That is nice, I guess...

320
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,875
You're a risk-taker,
too, aren't you?

321
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,416
Well, I guess
you could say that.

322
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,208
You know, I think you're
just the kind of performer

323
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,625
that Kaleido Stage
needs right now, Sora.

324
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,166
Thanks.

325
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,875
It looks like you'll be going
back sooner than I expected.

326
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,875
Yes. Milo twisted an ankle
during the performance today.

327
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,000
I would rather cancel
all the rest of the shows

328
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,791
than have someone perform
while they're injured.

329
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,666
What kind of trees are those?

330
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,250
They're olives.

331
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,583
Pack plants olive trees wherever
we camp. It's kind of a hobby.

332
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,333
Did you know that olives are
a symbol of peace because they

333
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,791
can grow back even after they've
been burned to the ground?

334
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:57,375
I think that's why I like them.
Well, that and they're essential

335
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,125
for a good salad.

336
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,291
She's really very charming.
I've seen a lot of people play

337
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,541
that princess, including Pamela,
but I've never seen anyone bring

338
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,291
the kind of talent and energy
to it that Sora did today.

339
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,583
I think she'll be better
than anyone we've ever seen

340
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,708
if she just gets the
right kind of guidance.

341
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,250
Right.

342
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,291
Don't worry, I'll make sure she
gets all the help she needs.

343
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,333
Will you come see me perform
at Kaleido Stage sometime?

344
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,250
If I feel like it.

345
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,416
Hey, that's not very nice...

346
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,708
He told me he
doesn't need me anymore.

347
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,541
Oh no! It looks like Sarah
might be leaving Kaleido Stage!

348
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,833
And not only that...

349
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,750
They've secretly been
in love for ten years!

350
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,750
It's a love triangle!
How romantic!

351
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,125
Ugh, everything
is so complicated!

352
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,291
But I can't just let
her leave! Can I? Can I?

353
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,625
Join us next time for
'The Diva's Amazing Love.'

354
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,416
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
