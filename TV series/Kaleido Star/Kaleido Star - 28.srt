1
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,458
Kaleido Stage.

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,833
It's neither a circus,
nor a musical.

3
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,250
It's not magic, either.

4
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:33,583
What it is, is the best
entertainment show in the world.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,958
And there was a girl

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,166
who aspired to join Kaleido
Stage and become a star.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,416
She is sixteen
year-old Sora Naegino.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,875
However, the theatre
she's dreamed of is being

9
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,208
taken away from her.

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:51,083
Will Sora and her friends
ever get Kaleido Stage back?

11
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
Some call me the Fool.

12
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,750
I am the spirit of the stage.

13
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,458
I have only been
seen by a chosen few.

14
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,750
And right now, Sora Naegino
is the only one who can see me.

15
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,791
With her talent
and determination,

16
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,916
she has made steady progress
on the path to becoming a star.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,166
Last time, she even
had the chance to appear

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,625
on stage with her idol,
Layla Hamilton.

19
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,125
Just when Kaleido Stage was
showing a surge in popularity,

20
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,625
Sora and her friends began

21
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,750
to experience ordeals they
had never encountered before.

22
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,250
The betrayer- Yuri Killiam.

23
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,208
The current production
will be dismantled after

24
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,125
this evening's performance.

25
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,291
You're going to cancel our show?

26
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,541
None of them could
believe their ears.

27
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,916
Kaleido Stage was going to

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,916
be bought out and dissolved
right after the show.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,666
And the mastermind of Kaleido
Stage's demise was Yuri Killian.

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,500
The same Yuri who was once
Layla Hamilton's co-star.

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,916
He had been secretly planning
this takeover all along.

32
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,083
With the last show
about to start,

33
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,541
Sora tried to tell
her boss, Kalos,

34
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,708
how she felt about doing
her final performance, but...

35
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,000
I'd like you to know that,

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,250
even though this is
our last show, or,

37
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,500
really because this
is our last show,

38
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,541
we're gonna give it
everything we've got.

39
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,041
Is there anything you want me

40
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,125
to say to the cast
before we go on stage?

41
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,750
I guess there's one
thing you can tell them:

42
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,500
If that's how
they think of the show,

43
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,583
it's better not
to go on at all.

44
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,833
Sora could not hide her
agitation after the way

45
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,500
Kalos talked to her.

46
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,041
Shortly after, she
became unable to see me.

47
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,375
Fool? Where are you?

48
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,541
Fool! Where are you hiding?

49
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,875
Don't tell me I can't
see you anymore.

50
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,208
Why won't you come out?

51
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,291
Please, Fool.

52
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,625
I can't believe it;
it happened.

53
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,125
I can't see the Fool anymore.

54
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,125
Listen, if you can see me,

55
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,750
it means that you were
chosen for the stage.

56
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,875
There was a man who was able

57
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,208
to see me but then
he injured himself.

58
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,250
The man that I was just
telling you about gradually

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,750
became unable to see me, Sora.

60
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,541
Sora felt like
she'd lost everything,

61
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,083
and she didn't know what to do.

62
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,500
It feels like everything's
slipping away from me,

63
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,958
and I can't get it back.

64
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,208
I don't know what to do.

65
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,000
The thing that finally
cleared up her confusion

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,583
was Layla's
unexpected declaration.

67
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,291
I can still talk to your
father if you like, Layla.

68
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,583
I know you don't want this
to be your last performance

69
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,041
at Kaleido Stage.

70
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,041
Today's not going to be
our last show, Yuri.

71
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Huh?

72
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,250
Layla, take a look around you.

73
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,500
It's over.

74
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
You may be able to
close Kaleido Stage down,

75
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,333
but don't think that means I'll
never be able to perform again.

76
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,791
This isn't my last show
unless I choose for it to be.

77
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,333
I know that's true, Yuri.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,250
If I didn't believe that,

79
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,333
I don't think I'd have the
heart to go on stage today.

80
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,833
Sora!

81
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,500
I overheard what
you said to Yuri just now.

82
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,583
You really think
today isn't the end!

83
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,416
I was afraid... I'd never get
to be on stage with you again.

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,958
But like you said, that won't
happen unless I want it to.

85
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,208
Sora, we have a show to do.

86
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,458
And we don't wanna be
late for the performance.

87
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,833
Right!

88
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,000
It's just...
I don't want to lose.

89
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,833
I've never, not once
in all these years,

90
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,041
had a partner that's
motivated me this much.

91
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,125
Layla?

92
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,291
Where's Sora?

93
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,875
She, uh, messed up
her make-up, and, uh...

94
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:11,958
She's in there fixing it.

95
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,583
Sora.

96
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:18,500
Oh, Layla, I'm trying to hurry,
but I just- I don't know how-

97
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,833
I can help you with that.

98
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,375
Let me fix it for you, okay?

99
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,916
But Layla, I can do-

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,375
Stop talking, Sora.

101
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,166
I'll be finished in a minute.

102
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,166
I've enjoyed
performing with you.

103
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,458
I wanted to let you know.

104
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,500
But Layla, why would she
say something like that?

105
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,708
This isn't the end.
It can't be, or...

106
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,375
is it?

107
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,250
There. Finished.

108
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,916
Sora, let's go!

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,875
Right!

110
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,083
Fool, you-

111
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,791
Here I am.

112
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,583
So you can see me again?

113
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,916
Yeah. Thought I got rid of you.

114
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,375
The Sun!

115
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,166
This card means you should
have hope for tomorrow.

116
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,833
Hope for tomorrow.

117
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,458
That's great!

118
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,416
After this is when our real
performances are gonna start.

119
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,916
So the final
curtain was dropped.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,416
With mixed emotions,

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,000
the company members disbursed
to follow their own paths.

122
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,500
It's amazing how quickly
time passes, isn't it?

123
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,083
Two whole weeks,
and in all that time...

124
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,541
They wished for nothing more
than to appear on stage again,

125
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
and with that goal in mind,
they began a voluntary

126
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,791
training regimen in addition
to their part-time job.

127
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,500
One for you, one for you,
one for you, one for you.

128
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,708
Meanwhile, Layla followed her
father's wishes by starring

129
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,708
in another film.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,208
They had all gone
their separate ways.

131
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,083
Then one day, Sora, Anna,
and Mia got their chance.

132
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,750
I've found you a job
if you're interested!

133
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,916
Huh?

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,375
Good! Here it is.

135
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,583
It says they're looking
for performers at...

136
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,125
Marine Park!

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,625
The scale of the
stage was too small,

138
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,958
but they'd still find
a way to perform together.

139
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,250
I've had some
responses to my e-mail.

140
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,958
Really?

141
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,958
And they're all coming!

142
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,541
Let's do a show!

143
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,250
Sora!

144
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,791
It's been so long!
I can't believe you're here.

145
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,041
In this way, the old friends
gathered and formed a new group,

146
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,666
Freedom Rights.

147
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,458
They had practiced hard.

148
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,333
And Sora and her friends
performed beautifully.

149
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,708
Their show was a great success,

150
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,958
but somehow, Sora
couldn't help feeling

151
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,875
that something was missing.

152
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,291
If only Layla could
have been here today.

153
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,166
Hmm?

154
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,125
Just as she thought that...

155
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey, Sora. Who is that?

156
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,083
A mysterious
masked star appeared.

157
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,833
She gave a
breathtaking performance.

158
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,875
That scared the pee out of me.

159
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,000
Amazing! She was
only here a minute,

160
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,125
but the crowd's
in the palm of her hand.

161
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,541
Thanks to this mystery
star's death-defying act,

162
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,333
Marine Park was packed,
day after day.

163
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,416
Freedom Rights' performance

164
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,041
was also garnering
favorable reviews.

165
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,708
But one day,
an incident occurred.

166
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,625
Not yet.

167
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,000
It's the masked star!

168
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:53,916
Finally!

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,250
We love you!

170
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,333
A young brother and sister
climbed up a steel tower

171
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,958
in order to have a better
look at the masked star.

172
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,666
Oh!

173
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,541
Those kids are in trouble!

174
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,166
Call the rescue team, quick!

175
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,250
Right.

176
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,750
Melissa, hurry!

177
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,750
The way she moved...

178
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,583
she had to be...

179
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,875
Sora was convinced she knew her.

180
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,000
It's alright, I've got you.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,125
She's gonna crash.

182
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,291
Just hold on to me, okay?

183
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,916
Oh no, I've gotta get back

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,333
in control or else
we're both gonna get hurt.

185
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,458
I got ya.

186
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,875
You're okay now.

187
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,541
Somehow, Sora avoided
disaster by working in tandem

188
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,875
with the masked star.

189
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,541
The best part of this
is that Layla wants to be

190
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,333
a part of our company.

191
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,958
With her on our side,

192
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:20,291
we can make better shows than
we ever did at Kaleido Stage.

193
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,500
It-It's giving me the feeling
that anything is possible.

194
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,250
However, Yuri's unstoppable
evil scheme was to strike Sora

195
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,875
and her friends once more.

196
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Finally, the masked star's
identity was revealed.

197
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,250
After Sora and her friends were
forced to leave Marine Park

198
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,166
due to Yuri's interference,

199
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,416
they decided to participate

200
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,625
in the world performance
festival in Vancouver.

201
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,458
It was their only hope.

202
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,541
It's perfect!

203
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,333
If we raise our
international profile,

204
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,958
the Marine Park will
beg to hire us back.

205
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,875
In the meantime,
Layla was in London,

206
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,208
starring in her latest film.

207
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,750
No, no need to worry.

208
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,333
I'm glad to hear that the
filming is going so smoothly.

209
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,875
This movie success is
extremely important, Layla.

210
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,916
It could make
or break your career.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
Yes, I understand, Father.

212
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,000
If we keep on schedule,

213
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,333
we should be filming your final
fight scenes by next week.

214
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,208
I'm looking forward
to seeing them.

215
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,708
Thank you.

216
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,625
The day of the festival arrived.

217
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,000
What is this?

218
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,000
'Z'?

219
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,250
'Z' was an amateur group
from Vancouver who stole

220
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,041
the show from
Sora and her friends

221
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,208
by doing the exact routine that
Freedom Rights had planned.

222
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,250
Our move!

223
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,208
Hey, we do that in our show!

224
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,250
Are they totally copying us?

225
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,250
They were.

226
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,041
This was another one
of Yuri's schemes.

227
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,125
Then their careers will be over.

228
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,625
The audience loves them!

229
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,583
We can't let
those guys beat us!

230
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,125
Freedom Rights was in a bind,

231
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,750
and it was time
for them to go on.

232
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,250
What are we gonna do?

233
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,333
Huh?

234
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,625
Well, if it's an emergency, I
guess we'll have to let you go.

235
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,583
When you come back
for filming next week,

236
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,500
I expect you to be perfect.

237
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,750
The mysterious masked star
appeared once again.

238
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,666
This gave Sora and
her friends the confidence

239
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,458
they needed to go on.

240
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,375
It can't be!

241
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,291
How dare you show up here
without giving us any notice?

242
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,083
I just wanted to thank you
for the flowers, Yuri.

243
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,666
All right.

244
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,833
Just when everyone was convinced
of Freedom Rights' victory...

245
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,208
Don't you get in my way!

246
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,208
Layla!

247
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,333
What are you doing here?

248
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,000
Why aren't you in London
on the film set?

249
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,875
I asked them to
postpone my filming.

250
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,208
You had them do what?

251
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,166
I know you can't
possibly understand this,

252
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,000
but being here was
more important to me.

253
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:09,000
Until I can perform the perfect
show, I won't be satisfied.

254
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,208
I want to earn the kind of

255
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,875
applause that makes
my whole body tremble!

256
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,791
And for the first time,

257
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,333
I have a partner that
can make that happen.

258
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,250
Layla.

259
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,625
I can't leave this
behind, Father, not yet.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,291
Make sure you get back

261
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,500
to London and finish the
filming as soon as possible.

262
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,458
After that, do what you want.

263
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
Layla decided to appear
on stage again with Sora

264
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,833
and the rest of them.

265
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,375
That was when
a miracle occurred.

266
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,083
This?

267
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,083
Can you see me now, Layla?

268
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,291
So, having resolved
to live for the stage,

269
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,916
Layla also became
able to see me.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,333
Layla has always been a
capable performer in the past,

271
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,833
but today you've proven
to be more than that.

272
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,250
And now you're worthy
of all my secrets.

273
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,333
What kind of secrets?

274
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,916
The legendary great maneuver.

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,750
No one's attempted it in years.

276
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:22,083
And the last person who did paid
for the privilege with his life.

277
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,291
But he was not
the first to fall.

278
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,541
Many tried before him,

279
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,125
and many failed.

280
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,833
If you ladies try this,

281
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,750
you will only be the second team
from Kaleido Stage to do so.

282
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,083
Rare that I find two stars
capable of it.

283
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,125
What happened to the other
team from Kaleido Stage?

284
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,291
They died.

285
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,000
But I know... I know
I could do it with you.

286
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,666
That we could do it together.

287
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,916
The place where the two of them

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,833
decided to go for special
training was the Grand Canyon.

289
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,125
There was someone
waiting there for them.

290
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,000
The one and only person who knew
the legendary great maneuver.

291
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,666
It's been a while, huh?

292
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,500
Welcome.

293
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,625
Hi, Boss.

294
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,250
Let's get to work.

295
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,291
Sora and Layla's
excruciating training began.

296
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,166
It was beyond anything
the two had imagined.

297
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,250
Sora wasn't sure
she would make it.

298
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,625
Contrary to Layla,

299
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,250
who had steadily managed
to finish their assignments,

300
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,375
it was all Sora could
to just to keep up.

301
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,625
And then...

302
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,166
Layla, wait.

303
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,333
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

304
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,958
Tell me to work harder,
be stronger!

305
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,833
How can I be a better partner.

306
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,833
I'm sorry, I have
nothing to say.

307
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
Sora's determination was shaken

308
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,208
after she was
pushed away by Layla,

309
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,708
a partner in whom
she had put her trust.

310
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,916
Doubting yourself
is just a waste of time.

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,208
Either do this or don't try.

312
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,000
But it might be the
best thing for Layla

313
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,791
if I let her choose
a more talented partner.

314
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,166
After Sora lost her confidence,

315
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,875
she headed to Layla's room
with her mind made up.

316
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,666
Layla, I need to talk to you.

317
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,958
Can I come in?

318
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,666
Ken.

319
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,000
Layla isn't in
her room right now.

320
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,416
She went out for a run.

321
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,208
She's gone running?

322
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,208
But it's not light yet.

323
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,083
Layla's trying
to lose some weight.

324
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,500
But why?

325
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:45,625
Because when you perform
the legendary great maneuver,

326
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,000
you have a much higher chance

327
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,083
of success if both partners
weigh roughly the same.

328
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,583
But that's so dangerous, and
she's doing this because of me?

329
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
You need to stop believing

330
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,416
that all the problems in this
partnership are your fault.

331
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,250
Aren't the two of you
supposed to be equal?

332
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,125
Thanks for saying that, Ken.

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,583
Layla!

334
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,708
Sora!

335
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,083
I'm so sorry.

336
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,916
I wanted to run away,
because training's so hard.

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,083
I told myself I didn't have

338
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,416
what it takes to be
your partner anyway.

339
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,041
But I'm not gonna
doubt myself anymore,

340
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,958
and I'm gonna work extra
hard to catch up with you,

341
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,125
so we can perfect the maneuver
and get Kaleido Stage back.

342
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,958
And I promise Layla,
I won't doubt myself again.

343
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,208
I'll work twice as hard!

344
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,958
I'll be the partner you deserve,

345
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,958
the partner you're
trying to be for me!

346
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,625
No matter what it takes,

347
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,958
I'm not gonna let you down!

348
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,541
We're gonna do the
legendary great maneuver.

349
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,000
I've never doubted for a moment

350
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,458
that you and I would
be able to do this thing.

351
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,875
Huh?

352
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,916
Right.

353
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,041
Both Sora and Layla regained
their trust in each other.

354
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,541
However, fate had new
ordeals in store for them.

355
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,208
Wh-What happened?

356
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,541
Did you hurt yourself?

357
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,666
Due to her drastic
weight loss, Layla became dizzy.

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,791
It's nothing, I'm fine.

359
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,375
I guess it's no big deal.

360
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,625
She's doing fine.

361
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,791
Layla was injured.

362
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,500
What cruel fate
awaited them now?

363
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,500
At last it was
time for the show,

364
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,541
but would their
training be enough?

365
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,666
After Layla smashed her
right shoulder in the cliff,

366
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,916
her condition
became much worse.

367
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,041
Her doctor told
her not to perform.

368
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,958
Still, her determination
was not shaken.

369
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,333
Sora and Layla's show.

370
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,875
After overcoming many
harrowing ordeals,

371
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,625
it was finally time for
Sora and Layla to attempt

372
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,041
the legendary great maneuver.

373
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,666
It doesn't look like
they're wearing lifelines.

374
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,541
I don't know.
This is making me nervous.

375
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,833
Are you ready, Sora?

376
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,250
Yes.

377
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
Just focus on
what Layla's doing.

378
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,791
Let's do this, Sora.

379
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,375
Jump towards Layla, now!

380
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,500
It's like they both grew
wings. It's incredible!

381
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,083
As long as I can
stay up here with Layla,

382
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,041
I won't ever be afraid.

383
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,541
I'm so happy I feel like crying.

384
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,041
I don't ever want
this moment to end.

385
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,541
I want to keep performing
like this forever.

386
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,000
An absolute faith in life,

387
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,916
one so complete
that it knows no fear.

388
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,541
That is the meaning of the
legendary great maneuver.

389
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,625
Displays such faith in life,
it keeps death at bay.

390
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,666
That's why we thought
it was impossible,

391
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,416
but to find faith
as great as theirs...

392
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,125
Arlon, I think you
must have glimpsed it:

393
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:16,333
an act so powerful it gives
all who see it new strength.

394
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,791
We'll have to push harder!

395
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm ready!

396
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,833
One, two, three!

397
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,916
It was the kind of applause
that Layla had longed for.

398
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,125
The applause that made
her whole body tremble.

399
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,416
However, the price
may have been too great.

400
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,583
I think it is.

401
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,333
There's no way I'll
ever be able to perform

402
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,208
at Kaleido Stage again.

403
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,250
What?

404
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,666
Do you really mean that?

405
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,250
Yes, I do.

406
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,375
Kaleido Stage has lost
the great Layla Hamilton.

407
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:25,166
Now, what will become
of Sora and her friends?
