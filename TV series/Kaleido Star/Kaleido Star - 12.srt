1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,291
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star's about to start,

2
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,291
so make sure that your room is
brightly lit and that you're

3
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,916
not sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,375
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,041
Is there anyone you really
admire? Someone you look at

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,958
and think, 'Wow, she is so cool.
I want to be just like her!'

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,166
Well, that's how I feel about
Layla. And now it looks like

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,458
I might have the chance
to costar with the person

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,875
I admire the most!

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,500
I've just gotta try my best.
I've gotta, I've gotta!

11
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,125
'An Amazingly Hot
New Production.'

12
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,916
I can't believe
it's already over.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,583
It seems like 'The Little
Mermaid' just opened...

14
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,750
Sora!

15
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,291
What? What is it?

16
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,125
It's Ian.

17
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,125
It's Ian!

18
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,333
What?

19
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,291
Ian's here in the flesh!

20
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,291
In the flesh?!

21
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,583
Yeah, it's really him!

22
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,541
He's visiting here.

23
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,041
You not talking about

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,625
the Ian who co-starred with
Layla in her movie, are you?

25
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,875
Are too!

26
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,083
You're not a huge fan
of his, are you, Sora?

27
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,041
Uh, no, not particularly--

28
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,166
Then you've gotta help us!

29
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,416
Okay, what do you
guys need me to do?

30
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,625
I should have never
agreed to this...

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,166
Oh, I see him! There he is!

32
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,500
Where? Where?

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,833
Just look at that million-dollar
smile. He's so dreamy!

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,208
He's even cuter in person...

35
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,250
I can't imagine anyone other
than Layla playing the heroine

36
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,125
in my next movie. And since
I'm producing it, I have

37
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,500
the final say on all
matters of casting.

38
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:40,208
Ian, I already told you
I don't want to do your film.

39
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,166
Layla I know how you must
be feeling right now.

40
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,666
Omigosh! He's so adorable!

41
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,166
She's had her first taste
of movie success

42
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,416
and she's overwhelmed.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
So, Kalos, you and I
have to persuade her

44
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,875
to do what's best
for her career.

45
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,916
I know you understand how big
of a step doing this next film

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
could be for Layla, so please,
try to talk some sense into her.

47
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,000
If you won't listen to me,
listen to Kalos.

48
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,208
Layla, I think you need to go.

49
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,041
You're right. It's about time.

50
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,208
What? You mean you'll do it?!
You rock! Hey. It's Ian.

51
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,875
Just wanted to let you know
that Layla's on board. Yep.

52
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,208
Good-bye, Ian.

53
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,833
Yeah, I'll see you later.

54
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,833
Excuse me.

55
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,500
Mm-hm!

56
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,583
Hey! Wait a second!

57
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,375
What is it now?

58
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,125
When you said
she should go, you--

59
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,708
I was just reminding Layla that
we have a production meeting

60
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,875
to attend.

61
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,666
But what about my movie?

62
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,958
I've already made my decision,
and you'll have to accept that.

63
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,708
Shall we?

64
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,250
But, but, but, but--

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,541
There's a very good reason
we're doing this...

66
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,916
Oh, stop embarrassing
yourselves.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,250
Right...

68
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,625
Actually why don't you
come with us?

69
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,291
Huh? Whatever you say, Boss.
But how come you want me?

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,666
Layla, wait!

71
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,250
Look, Ian's hot
on their trail, Sora!

72
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,458
Quick, before we lose him!

73
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,833
Uh, I'd like to go, but--

74
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,291
This is just the prototype,
but I wanted you to see it.

75
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,625
Hey, what took you so long?

76
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,625
Don't ask.

77
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,833
The next production,
'Arabian Nights,'

78
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,916
features tightrope walking.
The climax'll take place

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,791
in the rigging of a ship.

80
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,083
Wow. That's so cool!

81
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,083
But it's just a tightrope act!
Seriously, circuses are so over.

82
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,125
Movies are the
wave of the future,

83
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,875
and this one is sure to be--

84
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,916
What's that thing?

85
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,833
The boat's moving!

86
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,375
Of course, when we perfect it,

87
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,625
the wave motion will
look more realistic.

88
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,666
Sounds interesting...

89
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,416
Look, if you like boats,
I'll make sure we have one

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,541
in my film. Yeah, Ian here.
We're gonna need a massive ship

91
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,166
for the movie. Yeah, the
biggest one you can find.

92
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,791
It's going to be pretty tricky.

93
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,000
Not only will you have a fight
scene with a bandit up there,

94
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,208
but the entire ship is going
to be engulfed in flames.

95
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,750
That's just ridiculous.
Layla would never--

96
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,375
That sounds great.

97
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,375
Hey, it's me. Layla wants
to heat things up,

98
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,750
so we need pyrotechnics.
Get me gunpowder!

99
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,583
Yuri, we should start
practicing this right away.

100
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,291
But my character's not
the one you're going to have

101
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,875
the fight scene with.

102
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,041
What? You mean you're going to
hold auditions for that role?

103
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,208
Mr. Kenneth's going to be
producing this show and

104
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,500
he's given me a
casting suggestion.

105
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,833
No, not--

106
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,750
That's right. He said
he felt that the bandit in

107
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,708
'Arabian Nights'
should be played by Sora.

108
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,750
What?

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,875
You mean that I I'm going to
costar in a show with Layla?

110
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,125
Both you and Mr. Kenneth have
got to be out of your minds.

111
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,625
'The Little Mermaid'
wasn't exactly what

112
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,375
you'd call a success, you know.

113
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,125
Be that as it may, he's dead set
on Sora. He said he'd double our

114
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,458
budget if she gets the part.

115
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,458
Okay, I see how it is. Sora?

116
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,541
Yes?

117
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,125
Do you really
think you can do this?

118
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,166
If you don't think you can
you have to refuse the role.

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,625
That's the only way Mr. Kenneth
will understand.

120
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Kalos, she isn't ready. If you
keep pushing her like this,

121
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,000
she's just gonna get hurt.

122
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,250
I think maybe you
should turn it down, Sora.

123
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,208
Why don't we just rewrite
the script so Yuri's in

124
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,000
the fight scene instead of Sora.

125
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,250
Kenneth will be disappointed,
but if Sora doesn't think

126
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,083
she can do it
we have no other choice.

127
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,625
But I--

128
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,916
I want to try it. Please don't
make me turn down this role.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,458
What did you say to me?

130
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,500
I have to at least try it,
Layla. Please give me a chance.

131
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,291
You've got to be kidding me.

132
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,625
I'm serious.

133
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,583
You oughta leave this
tricky stuff to the pros.

134
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,125
Am I right, Layla?

135
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm not really sure
I can do this yet--

136
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,708
She's gonna stink up
the place! Oh my god...

137
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,250
But I want to give it
a shot. Please let me try.

138
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,958
Look, if you're not certain
you'll be able to do it

139
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,791
there's no point in even testing
you. If you don't believe

140
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,541
in yourself you can't
expect us to, either.

141
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,291
You are so right, Layla.

142
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,958
Let me know when
you make up your mind.

143
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,291
Hey, wait for me! Laylaaaa!

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,958
Boss, should I--

145
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,000
You need to decide for yourself.

146
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,708
Walking on a moving tightrope?
That sounds pretty tough.

147
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,708
Layla couldn't even
do it when she tried.

148
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,708
Have you ever even
walked on a tightrope?

149
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,708
Uh, well, kinda...

150
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,500
Hey, Naegino! I'm not
running a circus here!

151
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,416
Sorry, Coach.

152
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,500
Sora, you're crazy.
That's all there is to it.

153
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,541
What?

154
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,750
If you've never
walked a tightrope,

155
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,583
you can't volunteer
for that kind of thing.

156
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,333
Yeah? Wonder why not?

157
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,208
If it were me,
I'd turn it down.

158
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,500
You really wanna give
this a shot, don't you?

159
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, I just want to know
if I can do it or not...

160
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,416
You know, my movie went over
budget after I bought all

161
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,875
that gunpowder for you.

162
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,208
So now from beginning to end
in this movie it's going to be

163
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,458
fire fire fire everywhere!
What do you think? Cool, huh?

164
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:53,250
Why? Why does it have to be
Sora? And why am I feeling

165
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,375
so threatened by
all of this? Why?

166
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,208
I think that one of these days
audiences are gonna flock here

167
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,458
just to see what she's up to.

168
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,458
Have you finally
come to your senses?

169
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,500
Ian.

170
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,291
Layla?

171
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,208
I hope you find a wonderful
leading lady for your film.

172
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,875
That's grea--

173
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,333
Now excuse me.

174
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,750
Cancel the ship and the
pyrotechnics. You can't?

175
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,250
You have to!

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,958
I thought you could
use someone to talk to.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,583
I've never felt like
this before, Yuri.

178
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,000
What's wrong with me?

179
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,416
This is about Sora.

180
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,916
Because she's got
something you don't have.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,583
What?

182
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,333
She's willing to take chances.

183
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,125
No one else and
that's including me--

184
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,458
I mean no one else takes
chances the way that girl does.

185
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,583
Right. 'Cause we're not stupid.

186
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,125
Maybe you're right.

187
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,083
But Kalos seems to like
what she brings to the stage.

188
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,041
Anyway whatever you decide
to do, I'll support you.

189
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,791
I think you should take me
back to Kaleido Stage.

190
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
As you wish...

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,875
Um, Boss? I wanted to ask

192
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,958
if you think I should
turn down the role?

193
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,208
I thought I told you

194
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,458
you'd have to make your
own decision on that.

195
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,125
That's right, you did.

196
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,458
In that case, I think I'm
going to have to say --

197
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,458
Wait a minute.

198
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,500
Layla...

199
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,125
Kalos, we need a test.
I'll take it, too.

200
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,041
You can decide whether I'm good
enough to costar with her.

201
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,041
What do you say?
How about we do it in a week?

202
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,458
If that's what you want.

203
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,166
Great. Both of us have a week
to work up our routines.

204
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,916
But I-- didn't mean to.

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,958
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with, Sora.

206
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,708
You look forward to wha?

207
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:09,666
I'm burning! I feel
like I'm suffocating...

208
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,041
I can't breathe. I'm gonna die!

209
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,708
Someone woke up on the wrong
side of the bed this morning.

210
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,791
That's right. 'Cause you made me
have a nightmare that I was

211
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,833
choking to death
in a burning ship.

212
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,500
Could I make a suggestion?

213
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,083
What?

214
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,875
In a show like Arabian Nights
it would be better to say you

215
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,916
were 'consumed by flames'
instead of 'choking to death'.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Stylistically speaking.

217
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,708
That's it, very good. Now,
remember to look straight ahead.

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,541
Don't look down.

219
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,916
I had a feeling she'd
be really good at this.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,541
Yeah, she is. But she's got
a long way to go before she'll

221
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,875
be good enough to
costar with Layla.

222
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,208
You're looking pretty
comfortable up there,

223
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,875
so why don't you get rid
of the bar and I'll start

224
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,250
rocking the ship?

225
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,291
Right now?

226
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
You don't have
that much time left.

227
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
We've gotta keep moving forward.

228
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,208
Right.

229
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,291
Try it again!

230
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,333
You'd be toasted
if this was the real set.

231
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,916
I'd be toasted?

232
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,666
No way!

233
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,291
She's doing it.

234
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,833
How's it going, Ken?

235
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,333
She's got a long way to go,
but she's getting more daring

236
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,375
up there. I think she's finally
comfortable with the rope.

237
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,375
All right! You go, Sora!

238
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,125
Hey Mia, hey Anna. Are
classes already over today?

239
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,125
You ready for a short break?

240
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,166
Sorry, don't think I should
stop working just yet.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,416
Sora?

242
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,750
Miss Sara?

243
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,916
You need to come with me.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,916
But I need to keep practicing.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,458
Practice alone can't help you
overcome your weak points.

246
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,875
My... weak points?

247
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,625
Um Sarah...?

248
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,416
KA-TSU!

249
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,125
The serene mind has no need
for the worries of the world.

250
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,708
Thank you, master.

251
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,916
This is Taurus's star
cluster, the Pleiades,

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
and this star is
called Aldebaran--

253
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,500
Uh, what's he--

254
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,041
And we're in
Aldebaran right now!

255
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,083
Huh?

256
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,500
Your body may
burn on this plane,

257
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,500
but you won't feel the flames!

258
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,291
That's very helpful, thank you.

259
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,250
We're not afraid of the flames!
We're not afraid of the flames.

260
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,333
Your fear of falling into the
fire is what's holding you back.

261
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,916
What you need to do
is overcome that fear.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,750
If you're not afraid of falling
off the rope, you're going to

263
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,916
be able to move
more confidently.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're right. Wow, thanks
for all your help, Miss Sarah.

265
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,666
Now, you let me know
if there's anything more

266
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,083
I can do to help you with this.

267
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,916
Oh. No, thanks.
I think I'll be okay.

268
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,875
Are quite you sure?

269
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,750
Ah, yes.

270
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,166
Oh I'm glad, Sora. Good luck!

271
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,750
Thanks, Miss Sarah.

272
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,291
It's just about time for
Layla's turn with the boat.

273
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,500
Right.

274
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,750
You've come a long way.

275
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,458
You're a lot more stable
than you were before.

276
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,583
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Ken.

277
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,208
What's wrong?

278
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,166
Isn't it going well?

279
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,458
I think I finally
understand how to do it...

280
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,416
Well, that's great, Sora!

281
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
But... Look, I know I've
come really far, but I still

282
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,458
don't think I'll be able
to pass this test.

283
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,958
Ah come on.

284
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,833
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with, Sora.

285
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,125
But you're doing
such amazing things.

286
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,125
And for never having
worked on a tightrope...

287
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,500
Layla's got to
respect you for that.

288
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,666
Right.

289
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,750
But I still don't
think that's good enough.

290
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,625
What the--

291
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,541
Oh come on!

292
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,875
What's the matter?

293
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,750
I can't get my locker open...

294
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,458
Sora!

295
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,708
Where did all those
diabolos come from?

296
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,875
That's pretty convenient,
wouldn't you say?

297
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,291
How pathetic that she's
staging an injury just so

298
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,458
she doesn't have to meet
Layla on the tightrope.

299
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,000
You put these in her locker,
didn't you?

300
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,458
You're awful.

301
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,750
Diabolo...

302
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,458
The diabolo!

303
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,833
She must've hit her head.

304
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,750
Looks like we made her happy...

305
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,916
My performance...

306
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,666
You know, it is possible
to work too hard at something.

307
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,208
Why don't you go unwind
in a nice bubble bath--

308
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,708
Sorry.

309
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,500
You know what would ease
your mind? A nice, warm--

310
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,291
Sorry about that...

311
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,916
It's bath-time--

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,625
Sora! Stop!
For the love of god!

313
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,291
Hey, where'd you go?

314
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,583
On the cup!

315
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,541
Nope, you jumped too high.

316
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,208
Sora.

317
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,750
Focus on the diabolo.
Great. Don't get distracted!

318
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,916
It's my turn on the boat Ken.

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,666
Okay. We're finished.

320
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh yes.

321
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,291
So the audition's tomorrow.
I look forward to it.

322
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,458
Right.

323
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,583
It's tomorrow.
No more time to practice...

324
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,791
Thanks for all your help, Ken.

325
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I hope I can remember
everything tomorrow.

326
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,875
Don't you want to practice
a little bit more?

327
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,125
Of course I do. But...

328
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,875
Layla has the boat right now,
and there's no way that...

329
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,791
Come with me.

330
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,958
What?

331
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,541
Hey! We've been
waiting for you guys!

332
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,708
Mr. Policeman! What are--
Hey. Aren't you the doctor

333
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,958
who took care of
my Dad in the hospital?

334
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,041
That's right. My name's Kate,
it's nice to meet you, Sora.

335
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,541
Thanks. Are you guys dating?

336
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,375
Well...

337
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,125
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

338
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,375
We've just been good friends
since we were little kids.

339
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,000
How come you've
been waiting for us?

340
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,375
Well, I was talking to
Mr. Policeman and he said

341
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,791
his friend Kate knows someone
who works at the marine park.

342
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,333
Everyone in my family just loved
seeing your 'Little Mermaid.'

343
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,875
Oh. Really? Thank you very much!

344
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,708
Wow! This one's real!

345
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,500
What do you think, Ken?

346
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,125
It's perfect!

347
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,875
Are you okay?

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,625
Yeah. I'll be just fine.

349
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,625
I've gotta lock things up now.

350
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,333
That's fine.

351
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,916
Thanks a lot.
For letting me use it.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,041
If you can do all this in a
week, Sora, you can do anything.

353
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,291
I think so, too.

354
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,083
Your last jump
is still too high.

355
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,583
If you can just remember
not to overdo it...

356
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,750
But Sora never does
anything halfway, does she?

357
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,750
It made me nervous
to see her go so high.

358
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,291
If you're not afraid
of falling off the rope,

359
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,583
you're going to be able
to move more confidently.

360
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,625
Uh, Sora?

361
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,125
Not afraid to fall...

362
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,875
It's okay to
fall off the rope...

363
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,833
Wonderful! That was very
impressive, indeed Layla.

364
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,875
Sora, now it's your turn.

365
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,250
Right.

366
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,583
It's almost over.
It's time to sink or swim.

367
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,916
I've gotta nail this.
I will! I will! I will!

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,291
That's too high!

369
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,916
He's right. The rope's going
to bounce her right off.

370
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,708
Sora!

371
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,166
Very impressive, Sora. 

372
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,708
You scared the heck out of me.

373
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,083
What did you think, Layla?

374
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,500
Don't you know a good
performance when you see one?

375
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,000
Believe me, I do, Mr. Kenneth.

376
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,041
I think Sora's
impressed all of us today.

377
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,541
I look forward to
starring opposite her.

378
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,375
Layla...

379
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,250
Um, Layla?

380
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,875
They're right. You have
something I don't possess...

381
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,458
What?

382
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,791
That said, if you wanna be on
stage with me, be more prepared

383
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,375
than you've ever
been in your entire life.

384
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,583
I will.

385
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,708
I look forward
to working with you.

386
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,208
I'm looking forward to it, too.

387
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,333
The two of you are
like oil and water.

388
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,625
And so I'm going
to perform opposite Layla

389
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,125
for the first time!

390
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,625
But our performance styles don't
seem to match very well...

391
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,083
I'm staying in your room.
I need to learn your rhythms.

392
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,375
What? Really?

393
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,833
This training's tougher
than I ever imagined,

394
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,750
but I've gotta do it!
I've gotta, I've gotta!

395
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,375
Next time on Kaleido Star:

396
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,541
'The Amazing Competition
Calls Up A Storm.'

397
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,458
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
