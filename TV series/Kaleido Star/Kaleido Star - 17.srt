1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,208
Hey, everyone, Kaleido
Star is about to start,

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,291
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit and

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,000
sit as far away from the TV
as you can, okay? Great!

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,916
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,458
Is there something
you're good at?

6
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,750
Like, are you a great cook,
or good at sports,

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,458
or really really smart?

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,541
Well, my friend Mia is
a really amazing writer.

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,833
I can't wait to see what kind of
story she comes up with next!

10
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,875
But we've all got to support her
to make sure she keeps trying.

11
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,541
Go, Mia! Go!

12
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,458
One week.

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,083
Have it ready to go
in front of an audience

14
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,041
by a week from today.

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,458
Yes, sir!

16
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,708
'Fire It Up! Amazing Mia.'

17
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,083
Three days from now I want to
see a rough outline of the show.

18
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,375
Just three days...?

19
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,125
You can do it!

20
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,166
Everyone in the company's
counting on you, Mia!

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,833
Will you two stop
talking to me?!

22
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,666
How am I supposed to write if
I can't hear myself think?!

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,291
It's hopeless, hopeless!

24
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,041
Now back to work.

25
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,291
Who am I kidding?
I can't do this.

26
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,416
Don't be silly.

27
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,916
Of course you can.
Of course you can!

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,333
Really?

29
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,791
You're just not good at
working under pressure is all.

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,791
Anna's right. You've got
writer's block because you're

31
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,083
trying to write a masterpiece--
just doing your best.

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,041
Just be yourself
and you'll be fine.

33
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,708
Hey, thanks you guys!

34
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,416
I was kind of freaking
myself out a little bit.

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,125
And from now on we'll try to
keep quiet while you're working.

36
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,791
Yeah, we're just here
to help if you need us.

37
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,708
Aah. First I should
relax and then--

38
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,333
Have you written a
fantastic masterpiece yet?!

39
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,083
I thought I'd bring you
something to eat since

40
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,291
you're single-handedly
saving the show! Huh?

41
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,916
Oh, Sarah...

42
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,833
It isn't funny, it's serious.

43
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,833
Now, now just enjoy your break.

44
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,583
But you don't understand I
don't even know where to begin.

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,625
I mean...

46
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,375
...the Boss wants me
to revise it,

47
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,208
but he doesn't say
what part he doesn't like!

48
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,625
You know, now that
you mention it,

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,500
it seems like he's always
doing that kind of thing.

50
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,541
That's right, when we were
doing 'The Little Mermaid'

51
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,166
he told Sora to
change her portrayal

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,750
but he never told her how...

53
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,833
That's right!

54
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,416
And if he had told her
what he wanted,

55
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,375
maybe she wouldn't have
agonized over it so much.

56
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,958
Why does he do that?

57
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,250
Oh I I don't know, I think Kalos
has just always been that way.

58
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,125
Back when we were
starting Kaleido Stage

59
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,166
he used to change
the show every day.

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,500
We never did the
same performance twice.

61
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
But, as the
organization got bigger,

62
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,208
we had to have some kind of
consistency from day to day.

63
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,708
So we added more rehearsals

64
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,833
and set the show in
stone before we opened.

65
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,000
It wasn't safe having forty
people on stage not knowing

66
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,916
what they were supposed to do.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,708
But I think Kalos preferred
working in the old way.

68
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,625
I don't understand.

69
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,958
Well, think about
'The Little Mermaid.'

70
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,291
If he had told you exactly what
to do when you played that role

71
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,916
would you have felt as
connected to her as you did?

72
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,208
I... I don't know...

73
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,625
But on the other hand,
it could just be that Kalos

74
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,625
wants you to do
the work for him.

75
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,583
So, Mia what kind of
story are you writing for us?

76
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,458
Well considering the
cast size I was thinking

77
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,375
I'd adapt the ghost love
story you and Anna read.

78
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,375
But it's still
missing something,

79
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,291
and I don't know how
to make it more dramatic.

80
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,708
I see...

81
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,125
Maybe there's something around
here to help you fix it!

82
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,375
I've always wanted
to work on cloth like that.

83
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,916
Maybe I should try it!

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,583
And I've always wanted
to try breathing fire!

85
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,250
But wouldn't that
mess up your voice?

86
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,250
I've always wanted
to do motorcycle stunts.

87
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,333
In the end, I think whatever
I write's going to depend on

88
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,791
who's still left in the company.

89
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,625
Hmm. You're right.

90
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,666
It kind of makes you wonder how
good Yuri's shows will be...

91
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,791
I heard that everyone who
wants to leave Kaleido Stage

92
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,458
is automatically guaranteed
a spot in Yuri's company.

93
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,708
Really?

94
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, should we go?

95
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,625
Maybe he hasn't asked
because we're so talented

96
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,250
he thought we'd turn him down.

97
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,541
I think you're right.

98
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,291
Or it could just be
that he forgot about you.

99
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,875
Watch it.

100
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,041
Come on, Mia! I want this play
to be better than Shakespeare!

101
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,625
Sarah, no...

102
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,833
Mia's working really hard,

103
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,291
so I've gotta work
really hard, too!

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,041
This isn't some kind of trick.

105
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,291
Kaleido Stage isn't the perfect
place you've made it out to be.

106
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,333
You'll find that out sooner
or later, just like I did.

107
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,708
Looks like you're
having trouble falling asleep.

108
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,000
Is something wrong?

109
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,375
Kind of...

110
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,041
Stop! You don't need
to read my cards.

111
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,541
But why not?!

112
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,333
Because every time you read
them they say something bad.

113
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,916
Well then. I guess I'll just
have to sing you a lullaby.

114
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:47,250
Here goes. ♪ Luralu luralay
it's the end of the day. ♪

115
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,208
♪ Luralay, luralu,
sleep is coming to -- ♪

116
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,541
Quit it! You're creeping me out!

117
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,458
Well.

118
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,208
Mia, are you awake?

119
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,833
Where's Sora?

120
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,208
She came by first thing
this morning, and then she --

121
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,458
She went to the rehearsal room.

122
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,125
Really?

123
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,958
Is something wrong?

124
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,375
Yeah as of today,

125
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,041
thirteen more people are
going to Yuri's company.

126
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,375
Oh no...

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,375
Sora is she crying?

128
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,708
So you've heard...

129
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,250
What the--? Hold on!
I've got you, Sora.

130
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,416
Thanks a lot.

131
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,750
You could've
really hurt yourself.

132
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,791
If you want me to, I can
teach you how to do it.

133
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,291
Thanks.

134
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,208
Anyway, I came to tell you
thirteen more people have quit.

135
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,000
What?

136
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,208
If this keeps happening,

137
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,625
there are only gonna
be about ten of us left.

138
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:57,083
Simon! Will you
please pay attention?

139
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,750
Sorry, what's that love ?

140
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,333
You were going to tell me
what you've heard.

141
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,375
Oh, well basically, I heard
Kaleido Stage is losing people

142
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,875
and they're in trouble.

143
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,333
And despite that Kalos is going
to put a complete amateur

144
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,916
in charge of our
next production.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,250
Frankly, I'm
disappointed in him.

146
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,916
That's why I came to you, Simon.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,125
Okay. I'll do it.

148
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,666
That's it? You'll accept,
just like that?

149
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,625
Look, I've wanted
to work at Kaleido Stage

150
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,000
for a long time now.

151
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,208
But are you sure Kalos
is going to go for this?

152
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,625
I'll persuade him.

153
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,083
Ooooh.

154
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,291
What's that?

155
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,916
Wow. Just remind me
not to cross you, Layla.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
Could you be
serious for a second?

157
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,125
I am being serious, sweetheart.

158
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,875
Look, this girl turns in
her outline for the show

159
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,416
in three days.

160
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,291
Once he sees what she's written,
he'll have no choice but to

161
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,291
accept our plan as the better
offer. If this doesn't work,

162
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,833
then Kaleido Stage is
going to be finished.

163
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,458
Yes?

164
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,708
It's Sora Naegino.

165
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,833
Come in.

166
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,916
Have a seat.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,125
Thanks.

168
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,125
I'm so glad you
came to visit me.

169
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,125
Uh. Well, I-- I was just
thinking about what you

170
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,666
were telling me at
lunch the other day,

171
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,958
and I figured Kaleido Stage
can't go on forever, right,

172
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,791
so I might as well make
a clean break of it, you know,

173
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,458
cut all ties and
move on with my life,

174
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
but I'm not sure that's the
right thing to do, you know?

175
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,625
And I was really thinking
Yuri's got this really good--

176
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,000
You're a terrible actress,
you know that?

177
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,541
Just tell me
what's on your mind.

178
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,708
It's just I want to
know... I want to know why

179
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,625
you're working so hard to
destroy Kaleido Stage, Yuri.

180
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,833
Why are you doing this?

181
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,708
Because...

182
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,291
I want revenge.

183
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,750
You're serious?

184
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,791
Yeah.

185
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,208
But how long have you known?

186
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,458
I found out about a year ago.

187
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,041
So that's why he's doing this.

188
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,875
Yuri Killian is
Arlon Brass's son.

189
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,041
Killian is his
mother's maiden name.

190
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,041
He's been planning
this for a long time.

191
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,458
This is the reason

192
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,125
I came to work for Kaleido
Stage in the first place.

193
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,333
My father was
a great trapeze artist,

194
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,208
he's the one
I learned the trade from.

195
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,166
He was one of the founding
members of Kaleido Stage.

196
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,083
And Kalos murdered him.

197
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,666
I'm sorry...

198
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,041
Sora come be in my company.

199
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,291
I haven't found a leading
lady to put on my roster yet.

200
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,500
You've proven that

201
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,750
you have enough talent
to fill that space.

202
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,291
I need you, Sora.

203
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,958
I don't know...

204
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,125
Looks like the cast list has
shrunk to about ten people.

205
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,958
That Yuri. What a creep!
How's it going, Mia?

206
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,583
Now that the cast list
is so small...

207
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,583
What's wrong?

208
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,916
How about I merge

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,458
the character of the
ghost with the circus owner?

210
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,375
And that way all the
ghost's flashbacks can be about

211
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,583
how great it was when his
circus was in its heyday.

212
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh! This story line
is gonna showcase

213
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,958
the talents of everyone
we've got left!

214
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,333
Let's see... So the only one
who remains by his side

215
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
is the woman who
used to be his lover...

216
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,916
Good, good...

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,541
The last scene is going
to be heart wrenching,

218
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:25,250
when he says good-bye forever to
the only woman he's ever loved.

219
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,208
It'll be great!
Everybody's gonna be crying.

220
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,625
Maybe this'll be
a masterpiece after all!

221
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,958
Go, Mia!

222
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,500
I might even be
better than Shakespeare!

223
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,125
Really?!

224
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,666
Finished!

225
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, you can't say
I didn't warn you

226
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,000
it would be like this, Kalos.

227
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:02,166
Mia's not a professional, she
doesn't know what she's doing.

228
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,416
Listen, Simon Park is
interested in helping us

229
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,291
remount 'Cinderella.' I think
it's our best bet, Kalos.

230
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,333
What is it?

231
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,166
Simon Park is here
to see you, sir.

232
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,375
Send him in.

233
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,750
Then everything is set.
Mia, you can leave.

234
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,916
Thank you.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,166
Wait.

236
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,375
Our next main stage show
is going to be produced

237
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,416
and directed by Mia Guillem.

238
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,708
Kalos!

239
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,375
Your script needs revision.

240
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,625
You still have four
days to the deadline.

241
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,458
Just my luck. I thought I
was gonna work for you guys,

242
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,250
but I was edged out
by someone prettier.

243
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,750
Simon, wait!

244
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,458
Please don't go. I'd like
for you to act as Mia's mentor

245
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,000
and script supervisor
for this project.

246
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,083
Kalos that's an insulting offer.

247
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,541
Not at all. It sounds
interesting, Layla.

248
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,500
I'd be delighted to.

249
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,625
Well, I've got another
appointment, so I've gotta run.

250
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,000
Send a copy of the script to
my house. All the rest of that

251
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,000
contract stuff can be done
through my agents. See you soon!

252
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,541
You mean the Simon Park
is going to help me?

253
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,166
That's what Kalos wants.

254
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,125
What?!

255
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,791
That's incredible!

256
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,000
I know! I still can't believe
that that genius Simon Park

257
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,916
is gonna be reading my script!
This is beyond exciting!

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,125
And...

259
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,375
Before I send a copy
of the script to him,

260
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,000
I intend to revise it
until it's perfect!

261
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,583
Yeah!

262
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,958
First of all, I'm gonna work on
all the parts I don't like...

263
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,458
Mia's show is going to be great,
I know it. I just wish I didn't

264
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,541
feel so strange about
staying. Yuri's story...

265
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,958
I wonder if it
really could be true?

266
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,625
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,125
Oh, no I am!

268
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,291
Where are you off to?

269
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,375
Uh well I was...

270
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,208
I see. So that's what
Yuri's been telling people.

271
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,750
Yes.

272
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,958
Kalos pressured my father into
attempting a risky maneuver.

273
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,333
Then he used his death
to promote the show.

274
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,750
It's true that our investors

275
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,666
at that time wanted us
to cover up Arlon's death.

276
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,125
Which meant that

277
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,291
the rumors spread quickly
and our audience increased.

278
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,958
However Arlon tried
that maneuver on his own,

279
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,708
nobody made him do it.

280
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,875
Then you're saying
Yuri lied to me?

281
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,958
No, I think Yuri
honestly believes that

282
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,166
that's what happened.

283
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,791
But you'd think he'd
know better than that:

284
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,541
if somebody's afraid to
jump, then they can't jump.

285
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,958
Kalos has been blaming
himself for Arlon's death

286
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,750
ever since it happened.
And I think that's why

287
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,416
he hasn't tried
to stand up to Yuri.

288
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,125
He has some pretty difficult
things to deal with,

289
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,625
don't you think?

290
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,666
I don't want you and your
friends to worry about this--

291
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,000
you've got enough

292
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,125
on your plate helping Mia
get her script ready.

293
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,208
Right.

294
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm coming, I'm coming.

295
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,833
Hello, how can I help you?

296
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,583
Oh, yes, could you
hold on a moment, please?

297
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,833
It's Simon Park
calling for Mia!

298
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,208
Right! You want me to cut
pages two through four...

299
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,625
And what was that about pages
five through twenty-four?

300
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh, you-- you want me
to cut those, too?

301
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,375
Okay. And you want me
to change the last scene...

302
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,583
But that that's when the hero
and the heroine say good-bye

303
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,166
for the very last time...

304
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,083
I know, but that sort of long
good-bye's been done to death.

305
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,541
Listen, I want you to
replace those cut scenes

306
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,083
with something more fun.

307
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,041
And then try to come up with
a splashier climax, okay?

308
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:52,916
Okay...

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,875
Great. Can't wait to see it!

310
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,541
Bye...

311
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,916
Mia?

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,458
So basically I have
to write the whole thing over.

313
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,125
All of it?

314
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,583
So that's it. I guess I'm going
to go tell the Boss I'm sorry.

315
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,083
Who am I kidding, I don't
know what I'm doing here.

316
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,875
I'm sorry I let you down.

317
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,458
No, wait, Mia!

318
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,083
Why are you just giving up?

319
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,000
Because I-- what if I keep
trying and I can't get it right?

320
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,375
There's no sense in
wasting everybody's time.

321
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,333
You won't!

322
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,125
I'm trying to do
what's best for the company!

323
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,958
Then you should keep
writing, Mia. Kalos would never

324
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,250
have asked you to do this if
he wasn't certain you could.

325
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,333
But...

326
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,583
You wanna be a writer,
so write, Mia.

327
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,958
You'll regret it if
you give up on this.

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,416
Once you start believing you
can't do something, it's over.

329
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,750
When we first started

330
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,125
the Triple Illusion I
thought we'd never get it.

331
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,333
It seemed like no matter how
hard we tried we always failed.

332
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,875
I was so frustrated

333
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,625
I even stepped down
from the role, remember?

334
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,500
But you wouldn't
let me give up. You said:

335
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,333
I'd rather try to perfect
this with Anna and Sora.

336
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,750
When you said that,
I knew I had to succeed.

337
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,583
I thought to myself, 'I won't
let Mia down, no matter what.'

338
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,875
That's why I pushed myself.

339
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,166
Mia please don't
give up on this.

340
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:17,083
I can do this. I won't give up.
I can do this. I can do this!

341
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:24,333
I won't give up.
I won't give up.

342
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,708
This story's about refusing
to give up hope. It's perfect!

343
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,333
Everyone else has left
Kaleido Stage but us.

344
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,000
Still, we keep performing.

345
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,500
And if this show's successful,
maybe we can win back some of

346
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,625
the people who have
gone to Yuri's company.

347
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,875
That's perfect! I can use
all of this in my story!

348
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,583
Great. And now I'd like to
see everyone we've got left.

349
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,333
Right away.

350
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,250
We'll be right back.

351
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,666
And so, since, as you know,

352
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,208
we don't have that
many people left,

353
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,125
I need you all to prepare three
different kinds of routines.

354
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,625
They can be anything,

355
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,458
just use as many different
kinds of techniques as you can.

356
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,750
How can we come up with that
if we don't know the story?

357
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,541
I'm sorry, but the script
isn't finished yet, so --

358
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,166
Will it be finished
by the end of the week.

359
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,666
I'll have it ready.
Don't worry.

360
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,416
Then I guess we
should start practicing.

361
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,625
Right.

362
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,333
Good, now wrap it around
as tight as you can.

363
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,541
Right. I'll make sure the
rewrites highlight that aspect

364
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
of the performances...

365
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,000
Light five looks good,
go to the next one?

366
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,625
And everybody's working so hard
to create their own routines.

367
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,833
It's just the way it
used to be, isn't it, Kalos?

368
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm just not sold yet.

369
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,583
Look, gimme another
version of the ending.

370
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,000
This is what I've been
working on. What do you think?

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,666
Now that looks interesting.

372
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,500
I can't wait to try it out!

373
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,250
Sora.

374
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,416
Yes, Layla?

375
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Of all the people left
at Kaleido Stage,

376
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,416
you're the only one who's
skilled enough to be my partner.

377
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,250
We'll work on
something together.

378
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,916
And it's not up for discussion.

379
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,166
Okay!

380
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,166
Now we're
getting somewhere, love.

381
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,416
Thanks.

382
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
But there are eight more
hours to the deadline,

383
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,166
so I want you to
keep working, kid.

384
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,625
Right.

385
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,291
I wanna see all the minor
characters' subplots climax

386
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,916
at the same time as the
protagonist's, so you get

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,041
that charged energy that
Kaleido Stage is famous for.

388
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,208
Know what I mean?

389
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,791
I'll work on that.
Thanks for your help.

390
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:43,416
Mia?

391
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,791
You gonna make it?

392
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,708
Hmm. It's just
missing one thing.

393
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,083
What?

394
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,750
All the ladies' costumes
should have shorter skirts.

395
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,416
Huh?

396
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,916
Just kidding. It's perfect, kid.

397
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,958
I want to open this show
a week from today.

398
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,958
Start rehearsals immediately.

399
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,166
Let's go, Mia.

400
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,041
Right. Thank you very much.
For everything.

401
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,625
The setting is a world of fire
and darkness. The story is about

402
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:25,000
two groups of people who fight
for dominion of that world.

403
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,916
In that scene I wanted you to
be more wild and desperate.

404
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,416
Um, but maybe it's okay...

405
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,666
Give your notes with confidence
or don't give them at all.

406
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,958
Right.

407
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,791
Originally, these two
used to be best friends.

408
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,541
But as they got older,
they began to change.

409
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,333
This new director's been
bombarding me with crazy ideas

410
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,666
for the set every morning.
She's a techie's nightmare.

411
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,500
Jean you couldn't be happier.

412
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,166
You either, Kalos.

413
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,083
Anna, I need you
in there faster!

414
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,416
Sora, make those moves bolder!

415
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,375
I thought this
could be our title.

416
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,791
Yume Kibo? 'Dream'
and 'hope' in Japanese?

417
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,916
Well, I started studying
Japanese recently and...

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,875
Not strong enough...

419
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,416
I agree.

420
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,333
But after such a long time
fighting, they began to feel

421
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,750
that they should live
together like they used to.

422
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,958
They realized that they
were just struggling against

423
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,583
the people that they
respected most in the world.

424
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,500
This seemed so empty to them.

425
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,416
In acknowledging the others'
strengths, they were able

426
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,208
to forgive each other and
live in harmony once more.

427
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:45,416
Beautiful. That kid really hit
the bull-eye on her first shot.

428
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,375
So when they finally
stop fighting each other,

429
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,958
I think that's when
they attain true freedom.

430
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,458
That's what I think I want
to call the show: 'Freedom.'

431
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,458
Yeah!

432
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,041
You did it, Mia!

433
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,666
They sound like they really
like it. This is great!

434
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,541
Someday, even the people
who've left Kaleido Stage will

435
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,458
stand here and enjoy
this applause with us.

436
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,166
I know it!

437
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,333
Hey, apologize to everyone!

438
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:47,416
Mia's play was a big big
BIG success. But even so...

439
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,791
Yuri's got us now...

440
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,333
Kaleido Stage is shutting down.

441
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,625
Layla, how can we
stop this from happening?

442
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,125
How, how, how?!

443
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,708
Join us next time for,
'Yuri's Amazing Trap.'

444
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,625
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
