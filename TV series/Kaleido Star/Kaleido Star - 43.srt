00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,916
Hello everybody!
Kaleido Star's about to start.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,750
While you're watching
make sure the room is well lit,

3
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,500
and don't sit too
close to the TV!

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,416
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,250
Have any of you
ever told someone

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
how you really felt about them?

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,333
Maybe told them
that you love them?

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,750
Just the idea of it
makes me nervous.

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,458
Mr. Policeman has decided
to ask Miss Kate to marry him!

10
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,958
That Mr. Policeman.

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,625
He may be a big guy, but
he's definitely got a soft side.

12
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,083
He's even a little shy.

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,833
Be brave Mr. Policeman!

14
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,500
Remember, it's all about
courage, right Ken?

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,666
Hey, what's wrong with you,
you look kinda pale...

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,458
What if I made you
become my partner.

17
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,750
Hey, let me go,
stop, you're hurting me!

18
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:49,958
Are you the one?

19
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you the one that
can become my partner?

20
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,583
Sophie!

21
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,083
Sophie!

22
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,791
Leon?

23
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,625
Sophie.

24
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,541
I'm so happy.

25
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,625
I saw a side of Leon that
I've never seen before.

26
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,791
It was different than his
regular cold personality.

27
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,583
He was kind.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,000
And so sad.

29
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,333
But Leon likes to compete.

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,958
And I've decided I'm not
gonna do that anymore.

31
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,375
So I can't become his partner.

32
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,333
The dream that
I have is different

33
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,500
from Leon's and Layla's.

34
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,666
It's my dream and mine alone.

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,666
Someday when
I get back on stage,

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,875
I'll finally create
my dream show.

37
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,333
One with no competitions,
that everyone can enjoy.

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,583
That's the kind of Kaleido Stage
that I wanna be a part of.

39
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,708
"Mr. Policeman's
Amazing Proposal."

40
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,375
There she is!

41
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,125
Wow, I'm really nervous.

42
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,708
I knew that you were gonna
be too nervous to do this.

43
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,333
That's why I came prepared.

44
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,583
Okay Jonathan, give it to him!

45
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,333
You brought me a book?

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,625
The Perfect Dating Manual: 100
Ways To Captivate Her Heart!

47
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,916
Listen, if you don't want to
lose Sora to Leon I suggest

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,666
you start reading that book and
captivate her heart, got it?

49
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,291
I'm dressed like
a coffee machine...

50
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,083
Oh don't worry about it,
that getup really suits you!

51
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,208
Thanks, but you're not helping.

52
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,708
Besides, if she sees me dressed
up like a vending machine,

53
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,375
she'll think I've
teamed up with Anna.

54
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,083
And what's wrong with that?

55
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,708
A woman in trouble
is your best target.

56
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,041
While you tenderly console her,
take advantage of her

57
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,333
confusion and ask her
out on a date, oh yeah!

58
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,916
Make sure you take her
out for a nice pricey lunch,

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,958
and then her heart
will be yours.

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,583
You've got my guarantee.

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,000
Alright guys, now's your chance
to shoot for the stars, oh yeah.

62
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,000
No way, that book
won't help at all.

63
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,541
What?

64
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
You'd better at least go out
there and cheer her up a bit.

65
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,083
But...

66
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,500
Thanks for always
helping me Ken.

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,375
He's not my
boyfriend or anything.

68
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,083
So what did you
wanna talk about?

69
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,958
Hey Ken, I didn't see you there!

70
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,208
Guts are what make a man!

71
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,833
Guts are what make a woman!

72
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,958
Life is all about guts,
so get out there Ken!

73
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,541
It's Sora!

74
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,500
Hey, are you okay?

75
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,458
Did I hurt you?

76
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,375
Talk to me please!

77
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,208
A woman in trouble is
your best target, yeah!

78
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,083
This isn't the time for that.

79
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,916
Are you alright Sora?

80
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,958
Ken!

81
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,458
Sorry, I wasn't looking where
I was going and I ran into you.

82
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,833
That's okay.

83
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,125
So are you gonna visit
someone at the hospital too?

84
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,416
Like Leon?

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,375
And why are you dressed
like a coffee machine?

86
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,791
Yeah, I know that
I must look pretty silly,

87
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,666
but I've been waiting
to ask if maybe

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,583
you'd like to go
to lunch with me.

89
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,958
You're asking me out?

90
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,333
Is he doing this to
try to cheer me up?

91
00:05:56,416 --> 00:06:00,208
He must be...why else would
he be dressed like that?

92
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,000
I haven't done anything
but worry people lately.

93
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:03,916
That's it!

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,125
I'll go to lunch and have so

95
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,541
much fun that he'll
be surprised!

96
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,958
I would love to Ken!

97
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,791
You know, I was just
starting to get hungry.

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,958
Oh really!

99
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,333
Let's go!

100
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,666
Okay!

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,166
That outfit looks
pretty good on you.

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,666
You think?

103
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,958
Yeah!

104
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,916
So does this mean
you're teaming up with Anna?

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,458
I'm gonna go change now.

106
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,458
They've walked away!

107
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,291
So how'd it go?

108
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,708
I can't tell.

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,625
Then let's follow them.

110
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
It's a great restaurant,

111
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,000
and it's got a spectacular
view from the terrace.

112
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,666
In fact I was just
there last week

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,458
with a friend from
middle school.

114
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,916
Really?

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,166
We just have
to turn this corner.

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,500
And there's a...Laundromat
that's...shut...down...oh man.

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,958
Well maybe if we turn
that corner over there!

118
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,916
And there's a bowling alley
that's been shut down.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,875
Let's turn that corner there!

120
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,000
And now we're at the ocean.

121
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,541
How in the world
could that happen.

122
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,583
Hey, do you think that maybe
the map in that book is wrong?

123
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,375
There's no way that
map can be wrong.

124
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,083
My dad used it when he
went on dates with my mom.

125
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,291
How many years ago was that?

126
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,791
How should I know?

127
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,666
That was a really long time
ago before I was even born.

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,375
Look, what's Ken
doing over there?

129
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,208
He's relying on
that stupid book!

130
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,208
So what should I do now?

131
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,708
In unexpected
situations you have

132
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,208
to make the
appropriate decisions.

133
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,291
Let's say the restaurant you
wanna go to is closed down.

134
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,916
If you're a smart guy,
then you've explored

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,333
the area for other
places to eat nearby.

136
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,250
Don't worry, I'll be your
guide to the power of love.

137
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,083
Sora?

138
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,625
Sora?

139
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,500
Sora!

140
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,625
Sora!

141
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,750
Sora!

142
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,458
Maybe we expected
too much from him...

143
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,750
Ken!

144
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,916
There's a hot
dog stand over here.

145
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,583
I guess hot dogs will do.

146
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,958
I don't see a terrace, but we've
got a great view of the ocean.

147
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,583
Sounds good!

148
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,458
This is yummy!

149
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,458
Hanging outside when the
weather's nice is the best!

150
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,291
Thank you so much for
inviting me to lunch Ken.

151
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,375
No problem, you're welcome!

152
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,083
Wait a minute, why is she
the one cheering me up?

153
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,125
That's it!

154
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm the man,
I have to take the lead!

155
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,958
So, really great
weather today, huh?

156
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,875
Yeah, it's really nice!

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,166
Now what do I talk about?

158
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,083
I...just need
a little...courage...

159
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,500
Hey look, it's Mr. Policeman!

160
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,583
Mr. Policeman!

161
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,541
Oh, it's you Sora.

162
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,125
Sora!!

163
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,708
Mr. Policeman please slow down,
you're gonna knock me over!

164
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,416
I'm begging you please,
you gotta help me!

165
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,833
Of course, Mr. Policeman.

166
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,541
You wanna propose to Miss Kate?

167
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,083
That's the plan.

168
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,625
You see, I've had this dream to
make a romantic proposal by

169
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,333
my thirtieth birthday ever
since I was a kid.

170
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,666
But I don't know...

171
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,791
You're worried she's
gonna dodge the question,

172
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
so you're afraid to even
ask it in the first place.

173
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,583
You understand me!

174
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,291
Completely, in fact I feel your
pain as if it were my own!

175
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,750
Um I hate to
interrupt your moment,

176
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,291
but when is your thirtieth
birthday Mr. Policeman?

177
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,625
Well Sora...today's my birthday.

178
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,500
Today?

179
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,458
Are you serious?

180
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,000
I am.

181
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,125
Then you've gotta hurry up and
go see Miss Kate right now!

182
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,541
That's the problem...she's
on vacation from work

183
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,000
and she's not at home.

184
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,875
I took the day
off and everything,

185
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,708
but my dream still
isn't gonna happen.

186
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,708
I guess it means that dreams are
better off just staying dreams.

187
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,541
Mr. Policeman...

188
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,541
"Dreams are better off
just staying dreams"?

189
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,833
No way!

190
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,208
Our dreams are goals that
we can make happen!

191
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,250
We do whatever we can
to make them reality.

192
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,500
Mr. Policeman?

193
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,083
Yeah?

194
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,625
Come on Mr. Policeman.

195
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,541
Let's make your dream come true!

196
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,000
Sora.

197
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,666
Well, let's go!

198
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,875
Yeah!

199
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,375
This is a strange
turn of events...

200
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,250
That's okay, all that matters
is Sora's smiling!

201
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,750
First things first,
we've gotta find Miss Kate.

202
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,333
Do you think we'll
be able to find her?

203
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,083
Sometimes if
you've got bad timing

204
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,791
it makes everything
else more difficult.

205
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,041
Maybe it's hopeless after all.

206
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,041
Come on, don't be so
pessimistic, your chance will

207
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,750
definitely come,
you've just gotta believe!

208
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,125
Right, I just gotta believe!

209
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,041
Just like she said, I can't
lose heart and give up.

210
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,250
I gotta believe that
my chance will come!

211
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,500
Look!

212
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,125
Isn't that Miss Kate?

213
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,708
Hi, how're you doing Kate?

214
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,500
Were you waiting long Robert?

215
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,708
It looks like I've got
no chance of winning.

216
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,166
That's not true!

217
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,125
Women don't just care about
looks or brains or money,

218
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,458
they like a man that's
warm and sincere too.

219
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,333
Miss Kate knows what
a great guy you are,

220
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,500
she thinks you're a great catch!

221
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,125
Okay, I'm gonna go
find out what's going on.

222
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,791
Hey Sora, what do
you mean by 'find out'?

223
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,250
There she goes.

224
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,333
You know...if this dream
isn't gonna happen,

225
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,458
I think I'd rather wake up.

226
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,541
I'm bored.

227
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,333
You're bored!?

228
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,916
How do you think I feel?!

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,166
I'm tired of doing this stupid
exercise over and over again!

230
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,125
Yeah, now that's
what I wanna see!

231
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,000
I wanna see that
kind of intensity

232
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,666
and feeling in your acting.

233
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,416
You had a great presence
when you were on stage with

234
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,958
Leon and Sora, do you remember
the audience's reaction?

235
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,000
Um, no.

236
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,583
Oh man, this is gonna
take longer than I thought.

237
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,208
What kind of
special training is this?

238
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,125
Is this some kind of
performance art?

239
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,583
Maybe they're shooting for TV.

240
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,958
They look a bunch of weirdos.

241
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,000
It might be best
to avoid eye contact.

242
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,375
This keeps getting more
and more complicated.

243
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,666
We've gotta be sneaky and
make sure they don't spot us.

244
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,750
If anyone finds out, I won't
be able to go to school.

245
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,333
Oh, Robert's just
a co-worker of mine.

246
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,666
He went shopping
with me today to

247
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,125
help me find
something for a friend.

248
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,833
Okay, that makes sense.

249
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,083
But why're you asking?

250
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,166
Well, there's something
I wanted to ask you...

251
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,416
I guess that hot
dog wasn't enough.

252
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,916
Say, why don't we go
get something to eat?

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's pay day today,
so it'll be my treat.

254
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
I just have to run
by the bank real quick.

255
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,875
I gotta tell them
everything's cool!

256
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,708
I have no clue
what she's trying to say...

257
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,708
You're not making me
feel any better.

258
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,125
Come on!

259
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,916
Why are they locking up?

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,666
I've got a bad
feeling about this...

261
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,041
Sora!

262
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,041
What is it?

263
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,291
What's going on?

264
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,583
You don't think it's a
bank robbery, do you?

265
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,750
No way...

266
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,291
Hand over all your money!

267
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
Don't try anything!

268
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,916
I'm the unluckiest guy in the
world I got nothing to lose!

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,250
No, Kate!

270
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,041
Jerry?

271
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,000
Mr. Policeman, Ken!

272
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,250
Policeman?

273
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,041
You're kidding!

274
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,250
Nope, that's right.

275
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,416
So you'd better
let go of Kate now.

276
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,750
No...no...no...no,
that's just my luck!

277
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,041
My first bank robbery ever and

278
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,750
I've got a policeman
as a hostage?

279
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,000
This sucks!

280
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,250
I really am the unluckiest
guy in the world.

281
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,583
Listen up you guys,
I'm serious about this!

282
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,291
I'm not leaving til I get all
your cash, so all of you on

283
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,000
the second floor
better get down here quick.

284
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,458
Hey you, tie up the
policeman with this.

285
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,666
Who, me?

286
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah you, hurry up.

287
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,916
Yes sir.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,958
And make sure you
tie him up tightly,

289
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,166
cuz I'm gonna check
your work later!

290
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
If you need some more rope, then
I got plenty in my bag, okay?

291
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,458
Preparation is the
one thing I'm good at,

292
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,666
that's what grandma
always used to say.

293
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,125
Sorry about this.

294
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
Don't worry.

295
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,958
Just do what he says
or we'll be in danger.

296
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,000
Go ahead and tie it tightly.

297
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:13,958
Listen!

298
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:14,791
It's a patrol car!

299
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,500
What!?

300
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,083
You've gotta be kidding!

301
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,375
I told you not to try anything
and you go and call the police?

302
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,083
Oh man, could
things get any worse?

303
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,333
Nobody called the police,
they already knew

304
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,458
cuz this bank is monitored
by police security cameras

305
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,625
The bank is?

306
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,458
Nobody told me that.

307
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,250
But even if someone told
me it wouldn't matter

308
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,875
cuz I'm the unluckiest
guy in the world!

309
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,666
It looks like it really
is a bank robbery.

310
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,750
Sora!

311
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,333
Attention felon!

312
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,750
Release the hostages immediately
and come out with your hands up!

313
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,125
We can see everything happening
inside the bank on our monitors.

314
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,666
Yeah!

315
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,916
It looks like all
the hostages are safe.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,958
If you come out now
you won't have any

317
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,833
major criminal
charges against you.

318
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,500
You may not like the
way your life has gone,

319
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,500
but you know what?

320
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,583
--Neither do we!
--Can you see it?

321
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,291
--Yeah.
--Uh, kinda.

322
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,875
There they are!

323
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,833
I can't stand in front of people
and say it, but it's not a lot!

324
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,708
Sora and Ken are alright!

325
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,625
I hate the world.

326
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,625
It's full of phonies
that have nothing better

327
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,208
to do than to give
me a hard time.

328
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,041
But today was
supposed to change that.

329
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,750
I guess not now.

330
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,375
All I wanted was
to get my hands on

331
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,416
enough money so that
I could live my dream.

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,208
I don't need a fortune.

333
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,083
My dream's a small one.

334
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,666
I wanna go to
another country where

335
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,083
I won't have to deal
with phonies anymore.

336
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,583
Maybe then I could meet a woman
who wouldn't call me a creep.

337
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,291
I could finally find
a little happiness.

338
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,083
Why can't a little dream
like mine come true?!

339
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,625
I've been a good
person up until today.

340
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,583
Am I doing something wrong?

341
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,875
What do you think, huh?

342
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,000
I...I don't know

343
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,208
Do you have a dream?

344
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,541
Yes, I do sir.

345
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,083
You think it'll come true?

346
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,125
I know it will...I'll
make it come true.

347
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,041
You're pretty sure
of yourself kid.

348
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,666
What's your dream?

349
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm gonna create a Kaleido
Stage that will make

350
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,416
both the cast and
the audience smile.

351
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,791
Kaleido Stage?!

352
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,875
You mean you're part of
the Kaleido Stage cast?

353
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,875
That show's gotta be phony.

354
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,583
What?

355
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,750
What do you mean the
show's 'gotta be phony'?

356
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,166
Huh?

357
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,125
I can assure you that the
Kaleido Stage isn't fake.

358
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,625
I take it you're from the
Kaleido Stage too?

359
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,416
Well I'm not getting
drawn in by phonies!

360
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,083
Look, that stuff you
guys do is impossible,

361
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,208
and I'm not buying it.

362
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,791
Besides, I don't
believe anything

363
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,458
I haven't seen with my own eyes.

364
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,083
I'm a man with a heart of steel.

365
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,458
Then I'll just show you!

366
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,416
Show me what?

367
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,458
This isn't a good idea...

368
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,583
Don't do it Sora!

369
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,583
I'll give you a
performance right now!

370
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,625
Perform here?

371
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,541
This isn't the
time for that Sora!

372
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,583
You know he's right.

373
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,833
I'm talking to this
young lady about

374
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,041
dreams right now,
so quit butting in!

375
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,666
I'm gonna get angry!

376
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
So basically your dream is you

377
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,083
wanna make
everyone smile, right?

378
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,250
Yes.

379
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,291
Then why don't you
try and make me smile.

380
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,333
But remember, I've got
a heart made of steel.

381
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,166
I'll make you smile.

382
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,333
Woah, that's amazing!

383
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,458
I'm gonna borrow your rope.

384
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,166
Uh, sure.

385
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,458
Okay, I'm ready.

386
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
I hope that you enjoy
my performance.

387
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,166
Yeah.

388
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,333
Then my daughter's
boyfriend came in,

389
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,125
and do you know
what he called me?

390
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,250
Hey, what's going on?

391
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,458
What is it?

392
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,666
It looks like...

393
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,583
Like she's performing.

394
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,916
I wanna see! I wanna see!
I wanna see! I wanna see!

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,500
I want to see! I want
to see! I want to see!

396
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,916
Mia, which bank is
it, I'm on my way!

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,791
I have to hurry or I'll miss it!

398
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,375
I've got an idea.

399
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,125
Is that supposed to be a smile?

400
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,333
That's all you've got?

401
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,208
Come in.

402
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,958
I thought I'd find ladies here.

403
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,375
I can't believe
you three have been

404
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,875
locked up in this room all week.

405
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,125
So what do you want?

406
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,833
Mia rang and said Sora's
got a role in a copper

407
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,291
drama for telly, and it's
filming at a local bank,

408
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,916
isn't that absolutely brill?

409
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,125
So, do you want
to go and watch it?

410
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,750
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

411
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,875
Let's go, I'm tired of
sitting around here.

412
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,666
Besides, we've done as much
as we possibly can today.

413
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,916
No fair, I'm trying
my best, I'll work harder!

414
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,750
Miss Layla...

415
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,541
Let's get out of here.

416
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,541
I'm right behind you.

417
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,458
You can come too May.

418
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,875
Oh Cathy, it's so lovely
of you to drive me there,

419
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,416
I assure you this
wasn't my intention

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
when I invited you along,
but cheers nonetheless!

421
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,041
Don't worry about it,
I really don't mind,

422
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,333
although it is a bit
cramped in here!

423
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,041
Right now this is my stage.

424
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,708
I'm gonna give it my all,
for all of the people who

425
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,458
are watching me,
including that man.

426
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,041
Sora!

427
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,083
Wow, that's so cool!

428
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,625
I guess it's a
real thing after all.

429
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,125
My friends helped me
remember what it's like

430
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,083
to be a part of the audience.

431
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,541
I remember I first fell in
love with Kaleido Stage

432
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,291
not because of the stunts,
but the fact that everyone on

433
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,458
stage looked like they were
having so much fun.

434
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,875
Once I understood that my
mom and dad were never

435
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,000
gonna come back, I started
thinking about Kaleido Stage

436
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,125
and how I wanted to
be a part of it.

437
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,458
I had so much fun when I saw the
show as little girl I thought

438
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,333
that maybe...if I was
part of Kaleido Stage,

439
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,416
I'd always be happy.

440
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,666
She's gonna fall!

441
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,250
I think I just saw you smile.

442
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,083
Looks like Sora
won your challenge.

443
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,833
Yeah, I guess she did.

444
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,041
Do you understand why
Sora did this performance?

445
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,291
I know she wanted to prove
to you and everyone

446
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,458
here that Kaleido
Stage isn't fake.

447
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,333
But she was determined to
help you get your smile back.

448
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,375
She wants to
see everyone smiling.

449
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,625
She loves to see people smile.

450
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,750
In fact all she wants
from her audience

451
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,791
is for them to walk
away with a smile.

452
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,583
You know, I wanna create a
Kaleido Stage show where the

453
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,625
audience and the cast
can all enjoy themselves.

454
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,500
I like to make people smile.

455
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,541
I know that trying to
make everyone smile may

456
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,666
seem like a far-fetched dream.

457
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,333
But Sora thinks she can do it.

458
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,041
That's why she works so hard.

459
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,583
For her dream?

460
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,208
She's inspired me to try working
toward my own little dream.

461
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,958
And what is that?

462
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,333
I'm gonna ask that beautiful
woman to marry me.

463
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,250
So, as you can see my dream's
not much bigger than yours.

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,666
Mine's not really a dream.

465
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,666
I'm just a loser looking
for a place to escape.

466
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,833
Why don't you start
over from the beginning?

467
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,333
Yeah, I just may do that.

468
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,500
Well then...

469
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,166
Don't worry,
I'll give myself up outside.

470
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,541
Besides, you've got something
more important to catch than me.

471
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,750
Hey, you can stop, I get it!

472
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,541
I take back what
I said about it being fake.

473
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,541
I'm sorry I ever said that.

474
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,041
Really?

475
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,375
It's been real fun.

476
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,000
Thanks a lot!

477
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,625
I hope that you'll come to see
the show at Kaleido Stage!

478
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,833
Sure, see you in five to seven!

479
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,875
It's over already?

480
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,125
What a shame.

481
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,458
That was such an
amazing performance,

482
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,708
we really lucked out!

483
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,416
That was amazing Sora!

484
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,416
That was so great!

485
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,583
Sora's always so
much fun to watch.

486
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,541
I hate to say it,
but her moves were great.

487
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,416
She wasn't even on stage.

488
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,041
What is it about her?

489
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
And why don't I have it?

490
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,791
Oh it's no big deal,
thanks a lot you guys!

491
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,458
Kinda feels like when we
were kids, doesn't it?

492
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,083
Yeah, Wonder Kate had to save

493
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,958
Crybaby Jerry every
time he got bullied.

494
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,000
That's why I started bulking up,

495
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,583
I didn't like being
seen as a weakling.

496
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,458
But your best feature has always
been your kindness, Jerry.

497
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,000
I...um, Kate?

498
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,166
What is it?

499
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,666
Kate!

500
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,833
I wanna put you
under eternal arrest!

501
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,458
This is for you.

502
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,375
Happy thirtieth birthday.

503
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,458
And as far as eternal arrest,
all I have to say is...yes.

504
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,583
Kate!

505
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,708
Way to go Mr. Policeman!

506
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,291
I guess that right
now the stage is the

507
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,000
only things that can
captivate Sora's heart.

508
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:31,125
What Sagittarius desires,
a stage with no competition

509
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,166
and colored with smiles,

510
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
is a foolish dream that
seems improbable.

511
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,791
It is so foolish it's a path
no one dares to walk.

512
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,666
What awaits her at the end?

513
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,000
Thunderous applause?

514
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,208
Or scornfulness.

515
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,791
Only one of the two.

516
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,291
What is this feeling that's
taken over me all of a sudden?

517
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,958
In the end, everyone
needs a chance to smile.

518
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,291
It may hurt, but I've
got to figure out;

519
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,666
what is it that Sora's
got that I don't?

520
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,375
Mr. Kenneth has demanded
that I perform with May!

521
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,250
And guess what?

522
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,916
Rosetta's gonna be there too!

523
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,208
 I'm ready teacher!

524
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,083
Next time on Kaleido Star:
"Launching an Amazing Smile"!

525
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,708
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
