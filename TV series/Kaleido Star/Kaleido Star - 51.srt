1
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,666
Performers will be drawn here
by their admiration of you.

2
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,958
When that happens,

3
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,958
you must always meet
your challengers head on.

4
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,833
And when your time is up,

5
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,250
you must fight with all your
strength to accept defeat.

6
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,625
Competing with your
challengers will be

7
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,666
an important duty of yours.

8
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,416
Don't forget that.

9
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,833
Okay.

10
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,833
Layla's right.

11
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,333
I can't even imagine
a world without competition.

12
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,916
There's always gonna
be some kind of problem

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,916
going on in the world.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,875
But I still think it'd be nice
if there wasn't any competition

15
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,083
on the stage at least.

16
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,750
Challengers.

17
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,583
Adventurers.

18
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,208
Pioneers.

19
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,458
All who are called
by such names are fools.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,458
What awaits the fool who pursues
the dream that no-one dares

21
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,208
to dream is either
applause or scorn.

22
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,958
Please be my dream.

23
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,125
Sora?

24
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,833
To The Amazing Promised Place.

25
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,291
Bye mom and dad!

26
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,500
I'll see you tomorrow!

27
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,375
You bet!

28
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,791
I can't wait to see the show!

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,708
Ken, are you sure
your parents don't mind?

30
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,625
I mean they're taking
in my whole family.

31
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,833
Well my mom's the one that
offered, so it must be okay.

32
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,958
Yeah, I guess you're right.

33
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,666
Tomorrow's opening day, finally.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,083
You know they still haven't
finished construction.

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,166
Yeah.

36
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,125
But it's a big
construction project.

37
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,166
Don't worry about it Mia.

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,458
We're almost finished.

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,250
Thanks.

40
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,791
I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,291
You know, you should really stop
apologizing for everything.

42
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,875
You gave us a job
to be excited about.

43
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,333
I'm actually kinda grateful.

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,750
This is gonna be
our best set ever.

45
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm counting on you Jean!

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,541
Do you know if May and Rosetta's
maneuver was accepted?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The directorial team
was supposed to decide

48
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,833
at yesterday's rehearsal.

49
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,875
But Cathy decided
to test them again today.

50
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,625
I guess it'll be okay.

51
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,083
But Rosetta I'd like to see
a more commanding presence

52
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,958
from you tomorrow.

53
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,666
Can you pull it off?

54
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,708
Of course I can.

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
That's great!

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,250
Did Anna's clown team
make it in too?

57
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,375
Yeah.

58
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,125
You... you mean...

59
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,166
We get to... perform?

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
I'm so happy!

61
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,208
That special training
really paid off!

62
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,041
I can't breathe.

63
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,250
I'm serious guys!

64
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,875
So that means
everyone got their dream.

65
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,041
But... why aren't you
performing anymore?

66
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:27,791
Me?

67
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,208
Why do you ask?

68
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,416
Well, I thought you really
wanted to be a performer.

69
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,791
I mean, it seemed like you
were having so much fun

70
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,541
as a clown on Anna's team.

71
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,958
I thought "Hooray,
congratulations!"

72
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,125
But now...

73
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
That was a dream
from a long time ago.

74
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,666
It's not my dream now.

75
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,083
Oh, it isn't?

76
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,541
Oh I forgot to tell you.

77
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,166
I heard that our opening day
show is sold out.

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,416
Really!

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,625
Yeah.

80
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,833
I was kinda worried
because curtain is at

81
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,250
such an unusual time.

82
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,291
But that didn't seem to matter.

83
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,750
You know, Yuri's the one
who worked out our tie-in

84
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,041
with the tour groups.

85
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,916
Well well.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,875
So he has his father's
sound business sense?

87
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,791
I think he'll make a good
partner for you, Kalos.

88
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,833
I need to confess
something to you.

89
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,833
Confess what?!

90
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,041
You see Ken...

91
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,041
Yeah?

92
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm kinda full of myself.

93
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,083
What are you talking about?!

94
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,958
Could you explain please?

95
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,541
Well, I thought that the reason
you were always helping me

96
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,333
was because you thought I could
help you achieve your dream.

97
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,541
Don't get me wrong, I know
the reason you help me so much

98
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,083
is cuz I'm always
desperately in need of help.

99
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,958
I understand that, really.

100
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,708
But when I think
about helping you,

101
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,916
it motivates me and
gives me strength.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,375
So I've been letting
myself believe that.

103
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,666
Ken, it's thanks to you
that I've been able

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,416
to make it this far.

105
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,125
Thank you so much.

106
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,958
You're not full
of yourself, Sora.

107
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,875
From now on
you'll be responsible

108
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,458
for all kinds of dreams.

109
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,958
Not just mine or your
friends, but lots of peoples.

110
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,416
We should probably get going.

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,458
We've got to get plenty
of rest for tomorrow.

112
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, let's go.

113
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,791
A stage with no competition.

114
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,500
Well it's definitely
a long shot.

115
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,666
But as I get older
I really wanna believe

116
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,750
in those impossible dreams.

117
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,875
I've been told the only people
who can become true stars

118
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,000
are the ones who pursue
their dreams, even though

119
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,416
they know they're foolish.

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,083
It's got to be difficult
to know your dream is foolish.

121
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,250
The day of the audition,

122
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,333
everyone began reliving
their memories.

123
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,500
It was as if Sora's
performance brought them on.

124
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,291
They were memories of
when we wanted to smile.

125
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,583
And make others smile with us.

126
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,125
Her talent... it's the talent
of a true Kaleido Star.

127
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,583
A talent she
discovered on her own.

128
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm sure the audience's
hearts will become one.

129
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't you think so?

130
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,125
Do you really wanna
know what I think?

131
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,875
I think it's wrong
that you were practicing

132
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,375
the "Angel's Maneuver"
without even telling me.

133
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,416
Oh, I'm sorry Cathy.

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,750
Wow, that threw me off.

135
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,375
I don't think I've
ever heard you apologize.

136
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,166
So you wanna
take my car tomorrow?

137
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,916
I'm not going to
the show tomorrow.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,416
What?

139
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,125
But why not?

140
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,041
I already know Sora's going
to become a true Kaleido Star.

141
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,416
I don't have to see it.

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,916
Besides, I really don't want

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,958
to look like a sore loser
that's posing as her guardian.

144
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,416
Okay...

145
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
So you lost the competition.

146
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,208
Big deal!

147
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,791
I mean you're still
the same Layla Hamilton

148
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,791
she's always admired, right?

149
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,958
I think you should go
and support her.

150
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,708
Okay, I'll go.

151
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,958
That was fast!

152
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,416
What's with you today,
you're freaking me out!

153
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,166
There's nothing with me,
you just give good advice.

154
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,333
Really?

155
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,750
I didn't know you
appreciated my advice.

156
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,541
But I'll give it to you anyway.

157
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
Do me a favor,

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,291
can you stay like this after
we get back to Broadway?

159
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry, I can't promise anything.

160
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,541
I figured as much.

161
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,125
Listen I really think you should
come see the show tomorrow.

162
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,000
I have a weird feeling
that something special

163
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,000
is gonna happen.

164
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,583
Something special?

165
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,750
Yeah, I have a feeling.

166
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,916
And now the "Angel's Maneuver"!

167
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,125
Jump!

168
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,125
Hey, it's Sora!

169
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,208
Welcome back Sora!

170
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,208
I'm home again!

171
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,916
Did you miss me
while I was gone?

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,916
Sure did!

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,208
It's really boring around here

174
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,750
cuz everyone's at
practice right now.

175
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,125
They're at practice?

176
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,250
Then I should go too!

177
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:22,958
Sora?

178
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,083
Yeah, what is it?

179
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,958
You need to get some rest.

180
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,541
Well, yeah, but I...

181
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,500
Everyone watched you struggle to
perfect the "Angel's Maneuver",

182
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,791
so they're doing their
best to catch up with you.

183
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,500
You deserve to have a night off.

184
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't worry, they're
working really hard!

185
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,250
You're right.

186
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,500
Sora!

187
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,958
I've made a decision.

188
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,333
I'm going to audition
for the Kaleido Stage

189
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,291
and become a performer like you.

190
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,500
Really!

191
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,083
Jonathan says he'll try too,
he's got nothing to lose.

192
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,583
That's great!

193
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,250
What?!

194
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,750
You understand him?!

195
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,208
Do your best tomorrow Sora!

196
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,166
--Umm goodnight!
--See ya later!

197
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,916
Well, I'm gonna get going too.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,541
Sure.

199
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,875
Thanks a lot Ken!

200
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,375
A stage without
competition, huh?

201
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,416
I had heard that you like

202
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,166
to inspect the trapeze
the night before a show.

203
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,708
I guess it's true.

204
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,375
What do you want Yuri?

205
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,500
I thought we could talk.

206
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,666
We're two people who
couldn't become demons.

207
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,750
So you are right.

208
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,916
I'm not capable
of becoming a demon.

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,125
Did you come here just
to say "I told you so"?

210
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,583
You know on a basic level,

211
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,041
the "Angel's Maneuver"
can be performed alone.

212
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,833
You and I are just
there... for support.

213
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,166
For support?

214
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,291
Layla and Sora are strong.

215
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,708
They can do anything
they put their mind to.

216
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,041
But sometimes,

217
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,083
even the strongest woman
needs someone to lean on.

218
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,833
Our job is to support
them during those times.

219
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,333
That's our role, Leon.

220
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,416
So then, we are the angels?

221
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,166
I guess you're right.

222
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,833
Maybe that's why we
couldn't become demons.

223
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,916
Manami, Sayaka, and Miki
are all gonna be there.

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,333
That's great.

225
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,583
Do you think Yume's old enough
to understand the show?

226
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,583
I take it you can't sleep.

227
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,416
Uh huh.

228
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,791
But I'll try to sleep since

229
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,958
I've got to be ready
to give it my all tomorrow.

230
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,333
Well then, goodnight.

231
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,583
Goodnight.

232
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,916
The "Angel's Maneuver"?

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
Wow.

234
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,708
I've heard that it's sometimes
called the "Fool's Maneuver".

235
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,208
Well, according to the program
the story's about Odette

236
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
and her battle for
the prince's love.

237
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,750
So basically it's
about a girl having

238
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,125
a tough time
dating a popular guy.

239
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,916
Odette is convinced that
everyone has an angel heart,

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500
deep inside,
even the evil Odile.

241
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,791
That sounds like Sora.

242
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,250
Are you excited Yume?

243
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,291
She's in a good mood.

244
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,958
We could have waited for
the afternoon showing Tim.

245
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,958
I'm fine!

246
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,666
I need glasses.

247
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,458
When's the show gonna start?

248
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,791
It's like, a full house,
even though it's so early.

249
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,416
They say there's
some special reason for

250
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,958
these early morning
performances.

251
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,666
I really wanted to see
your Odette, Miss Layla.

252
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,833
I'm happy to say that I'll never
stand on that stage again.

253
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,750
Did you invite anyone
to the show, Leon?

254
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,083
I sent Alan passes
and plane tickets,

255
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,541
but he probably sold
them to buy alcohol.

256
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,083
He wouldn't do that...
I don't think.

257
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm sure your old partners
will be in the audience

258
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,791
to get their smiles back.

259
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,875
I bet they'll be glad to see
that you're doing so well.

260
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,250
Do you really believe in a stage
without any competition?

261
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,708
I've decided to believe in it.

262
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,000
You can't perform the
"Legendary Great Maneuver"

263
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,000
unless you believe
it in your heart.

264
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,458
And the "Angel's Maneuver"
is the same way.

265
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,833
By the way,
I owe you an apology.

266
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:07,750
Yeah... huh?

267
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,416
Apology for what?

268
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,916
When I said Layla was
a lukewarm performer,

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,333
you told me to
apologize, didn't you?

270
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,791
Oh yeah.

271
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,166
I thought she retired after
performing the "legendary

272
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,333
Great Maneuver" with you so that
she could leave on a high note.

273
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,500
So she would be the closest
to a true Kaleido Star.

274
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,125
But she mastered
the "Angel's Maneuver"

275
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,291
by herself and came back.

276
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,083
And, she was prepared to lose.

277
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,000
For your sake.

278
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,625
She did it for me?

279
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,666
If you hadn't competed
against Layla that day,

280
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,083
you wouldn't be as secure and
confident as you are right now.

281
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,666
Yeah, you're right.

282
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,083
Okay everyone, it's time
to raise the curtain.

283
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,916
Let's make this the greatest
show they've ever seen!

284
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,791
And now it's Scene 5.

285
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,041
This is where Odette
meets the prince.

286
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,416
The prince falls in love.

287
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,416
Wow, Leon's really into it!

288
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,666
Of course he is,
the material is great!

289
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,583
Scene 11.

290
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,041
The Ball.

291
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
Here comes Anna's clown team.

292
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,291
Oh wow!

293
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,166
Anna looks amazing!

294
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,791
It's time for her
special training to

295
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,666
finally be put to the test.

296
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,958
Don't go!

297
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,375
They're laughing!

298
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,916
It looks like she's
being pulled by a string,

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,333
but there's nothing there.

300
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,791
How funny!

301
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,000
Come back!

302
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,666
They think I'm funny!

303
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,000
Mom?

304
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,166
Dad?

305
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,041
I finally did it.

306
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,166
Congratulations, Anna.

307
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,041
The next scene is Demon Lake.

308
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,500
The prince has his
heart stolen by Odile!

309
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,250
Odile has a demon heart.

310
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,791
She's mysterious and bold.

311
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,625
And more dynamic than Odette!

312
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,875
She's so pretty!

313
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,541
We love you big sister!

314
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,250
Okay, set change
to the dark forest.

315
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,791
Odile leads the prince
into the dark forest

316
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,583
and they become trapped there.

317
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,333
Meanwhile, Odette notices
the conflict in Odile's heart.

318
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,000
Then a fairy leads Odile
back from her path of despair.

319
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,041
I'm counting on you, Rosetta.

320
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,333
I'm gonna give them the
greatest show they've ever seen.

321
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,833
Okay, it's time for
"Eternal Illusion".

322
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,541
"Eternal... Illusion"!

323
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,625
Pretty good, kid.

324
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,541
Thank you, May.

325
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,250
And now it's time.

326
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,541
Scene 32.

327
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,916
The angel's flight.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,958
We have to believe
in Sora's angel.

329
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,416
Three minutes and counting.

330
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,166
Okay, start opening the gate.

331
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,833
This is the part where
Sora becomes an angel.

332
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,166
Go forth, ye fool.

333
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,041
Continue to believe
that what awaits you

334
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
in the end is applause.

335
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,000
How beautiful.

336
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,750
That's our Sora?

337
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,333
She did it!

338
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,500
Now, lower the angel trapeze.

339
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,791
I'll show my angel
heart to everyone.

340
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,416
I hope that everyone
who came here today...

341
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,250
I hope that their angel
hearts will become one.

342
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,166
It's funny.

343
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,541
I always thought of a
performance as an ordeal.

344
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,625
I would try to get through it
as quickly as possible.

345
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,791
But when I'm performing
on stage with Sora...

346
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,583
I treasure my time
on stage with her.

347
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,166
She makes every moment
of her performance seem

348
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,500
irreplaceably precious.

349
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,125
I wish that you would enjoy
your time on stage, Leon.

350
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:06,083
If I become a true star,
I'm sure it'll change you too.

351
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:10,583
You know, no moment on stage
is ever the same twice.

352
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,000
There's no time
like the present.

353
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,958
So I chose to live in the
present and enjoy every moment.

354
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,916
That way,
I'll never have regrets.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
Sophie.

356
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,791
I finally understand what
you were trying to say.

357
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,458
Suddenly... I wanna
go back on stage.

358
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,625
I wanna perform with Sora.

359
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,208
Yeah, me too.

360
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,625
All of a sudden... I feel weird.

361
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,041
Yeah, me too,
I can't stand still.

362
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,416
Sora!

363
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,916
May!

364
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,125
Rosetta!

365
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,458
It can't be.

366
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,750
Mute!

367
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,666
I wanna perform
with a true star.

368
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,916
Then come on.

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,458
Let's go!

370
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,208
You wanna go too Jonathan?

371
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,208
But... I didn't think
this was possible.

372
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,541
It's amazing.

373
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,750
Even the most
competitive performers.

374
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,458
They're all on stage
performing together as one.

375
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,500
You should go.

376
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,708
Yeah!

377
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,250
This is the stage
Sora dreamed of.

378
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,500
Here, in this moment.

379
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,000
A stage with no
competition exists.

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,375
Sora.

381
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm glad I was here
to witness your miracle.

382
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,500
My role is over now, isn't it?

383
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,291
It's Layla!

384
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,750
You've shown me
the impossible, Sora.

385
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,708
Your dream has come true.

386
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,041
You're a true Kaleido Star.

387
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:56,958
Sora!

388
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,125
You're the best!

389
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,375
Bravo!

390
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,708
I knew you could do it, Sora!

391
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,791
So the dream has
become a reality.

392
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,541
I'm a little sad it's over.

393
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,500
But it's not over yet, Yuri.

394
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,750
This is the start
of a new dream.

395
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,958
Well, I should be going.

396
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

397
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,458
Um, Layla?

398
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,833
Do you think it's
alright if... if I continue

399
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,416
to think of myself
as your dream?

400
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,625
No Sora.

401
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,625
I'm afraid you cannot
be my dream anymore.

402
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,166
Live your own dream.

403
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,083
You've become my pride and joy.

404
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,000
Thank you Layla.

405
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,833
I will.

406
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,583
Miss Layla?

407
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:21,916
I turned in my resignation as a
Hamilton family maid yesterday.

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,333
I've decided I'm going to
chase my dream of performing

409
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,583
on Broadway.

410
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,666
I hope you'll allow me
to accompany you.

411
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,625
That's fine.

412
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,000
Let's get going.

413
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,375
Yes ma'am!

414
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,708
It... must be my imagination...

415
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,041
And so the dream is
passed on to the next fool.

416
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,958
The dream of becoming
a true Kaleido Star.

417
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,000
I heard the shows sold out
for the next two months.

418
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,041
Isn't that awesome?

419
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,375
That makes me so happy!

420
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,333
I wonder if I can
be in the show too!

421
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,625
Is something wrong, Rosetta?

422
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,166
It's nothing...

423
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,708
If you don't wanna yell "Eternal
Illusion", just tell her.

424
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,166
What are you yammering about?

425
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,333
Calm down!

426
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,000
My wings are my dream,
and on toward the sky!
