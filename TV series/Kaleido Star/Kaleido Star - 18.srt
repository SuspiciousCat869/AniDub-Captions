1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,416
Ladies and Gentleman,
Boys and Girls,

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,625
Kaleido Star is,
indeed, about to start.

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,833
Please make sure that your room
is brightly lit and that you're

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,791
not sitting too close
to the television.

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,208
Well, well, well.

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,416
Have you ever finished something
that was very important to you?

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,750
All of us worked so hard
to get this show on its feet.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:41,500
We worked together and had a lot
of fun, we laughed and we cried.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,333
Now it looks like all we're
going to have left are memories.

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,750
Can it really be over?
Can it? Can it?

11
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,166
Sora, you're the greatest ever!

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,708
Two weeks after opening,

13
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,916
the audience's reaction
was overwhelming!

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,333
Did you see the
paper this morning?

15
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,791
Of course! I couldn't
miss our review!

16
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,416
"Kaleido Stage's new
director, Mia Guillem,

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,625
has burst on the scene
with unrivaled brilliance!"

18
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,791
Oh, this is so exciting!

19
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,750
Don't think you can
get away with this!

20
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,416
'Yuri's Amazing Trap.'

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,625
"There have been rumors that
Kaleido Stage is finished.

22
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,291
But this energetic young cast
proves that the company

23
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,833
is stronger than ever."

24
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,583
I really think
that could be true!

25
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,208
And no matter how Yuri
tries to sabotage us,

26
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,875
people can't ignore us as long
as we keep doing good work.

27
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,500
I've worked on a lot of
productions over the years.

28
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:27,708
But I think this one might just
be my favorite one of all.

29
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,166
You're not just saying that?

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,166
No way. My Dad's old-fashioned:

31
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,750
he'd never say something
he doesn't mean.

32
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,583
What do you mean old-fashioned?

33
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,958
Wouldn't it be great if the show
sold out and we had to extend?

34
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,958
Oh! If the audience keeps
growing we might just have

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,041
a long-running hit
for Kaleido Stage!

36
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,875
And maybe that would
bring in investors!

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
You're all getting
ahead of yourselves.

38
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,958
Anna, you messed up your
timing on your entrance.

39
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,333
Mia, you're still
tensing up your face.

40
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,166
Sora, you got sloppy and let
yourself swing too fast.

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,750
If you keep doing that,
the spot ops can't light you.

42
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,541
This show is not
perfect by any means.

43
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,916
However. I think it
has... some potential.

44
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,041
I think that was...

45
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,500
A compliment.

46
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,041
She complimented us?

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,958
I can tell by the way Layla
talks that she loves the show.

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,875
Layla Hamilton
thinks my show is good!

49
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
That means more to me
than any good review...

50
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
This is gonna be
a huge blockbuster!

51
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,875
That may be right. But first,

52
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,916
we've gotta make sure the show
is as good as it can be.

53
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,083
Let's get down to business.

54
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,125
That's right!

55
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,041
We're going to
save Kaleido Stage!

56
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,500
Yeah!

57
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,083
The Death card.
This foretells the end.

58
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,791
I'd appreciate it if you
tried to predict something

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,083
that's not so gloomy.

60
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,375
I mean, we're doing
everything we can

61
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,916
to keep Kaleido Stage alive.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,666
The least you could do
is give us a nicer future.

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,708
That kind of defeats the
purpose of fortunetelling...

64
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,250
Sora! Come here quick!

65
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,791
Ugh... Toothpaste...

66
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,125
What does that have
to do with anything?!

67
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,583
People are filled
with a practice room!

68
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,458
That was funny, Anna.

69
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,875
But I didn't mean to be!

70
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,666
You've gotta come, right away!

71
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,958
What's going on here?

72
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,666
I thought everyone had quit.

73
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,458
Well, it looks like
they've all come back.

74
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,416
Maybe they heard how good the
show was and they wanted to be

75
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
part of Kaleido Stage again!

76
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,375
Just what I hoped would happen!

77
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,500
Even Layla said
the show was great.

78
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,583
Kaleido Stage is back, and
it's gonna be better than ever!

79
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,458
I guess you'll have to rewrite
'Freedom' for a bigger cast,

80
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,208
huh, Mia?

81
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,416
Oh, I can't wait!

82
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,625
I didn't realize
you'd be down here...

83
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,125
Ken!

84
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,500
The Boss wants to see everybody
in his office right away.

85
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,166
I wonder if it means...

86
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,000
It looks like
'Freedom's gonna be extended!

87
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,416
Come in.

88
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,708
Ready? Let's go.

89
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,708
Congratulations, guys!

90
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,708
What's this--

91
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,541
Hi.

92
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,833
Yuri?

93
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,416
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,750
Kalos why don't you
explain it to them?

95
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,083
Very well, then. I guess
you'll have to hear it from me.

96
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,375
It's quite simple, really.

97
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,666
Kalos is no longer the
owner of Kaleido Stage.

98
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,708
Should you choose to stay,
you'll work for me.

99
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,083
The current production

100
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,750
will be dismantled after
this evening's performance.

101
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,708
You're going to
cancel our show?

102
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,041
No way.

103
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,833
It's all true.

104
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,375
But it can't be there's
two more weeks of performances.

105
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,333
And all the shows are sold out.

106
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,125
We can turn this place around.

107
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,541
She's right! If you'll
just extend Mia's show,

108
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,583
we can make all
the money you need!

109
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,083
Oh, Kalos, don't tell me

110
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,583
that this show is what
you were banking on.

111
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,708
An extension? Of Ms. Guillem's
little amateur hour?

112
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,791
How ridiculous.

113
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,125
You apologize for that!

114
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,958
The shows have already

115
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,833
been canceled and the
tickets have been refunded.

116
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,750
Get your hands off me!

117
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,458
Leave Anna alone!

118
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,583
Let her go!

119
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,916
Come on!

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let her go.

121
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,541
Anna!

122
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,750
You're not hurt, are you?

123
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,375
Both the Kenneth Corporation

124
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,416
and the Hamilton Foundation
withdrew their funding.

125
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,833
Your reign at
Kaleido Stage is over.

126
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,875
It's mine now. Layla, your
father specifically asked me

127
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,791
not to offer you a contract.

128
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,541
But if you wish,
I'd be happy to persuade him.

129
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,083
Believe me, I know how
dedicated all of you are.

130
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,125
You'll always have a place at
Kaleido Stage, no matter what.

131
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,291
Will you join us?

132
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,416
No thank you.

133
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,708
I'd rather not.

134
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,833
I'm declining your offer, too.

135
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,083
Well that's just too bad.
Then I'll have to ask you three

136
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
to vacate your rooms
in the dormitories.

137
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,166
Show yourselves to the door.

138
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,791
That's correct, I turned
my rights over to Yuri.

139
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,708
And I think you
should quit, too.

140
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,666
But why?

141
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,166
There's a time for
everything, sweetheart.

142
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,666
Kaleido Stage just needed
to be put out of its misery.

143
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,666
Just thinking of you
still working for Kalos

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,333
made my blood run cold.

145
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,958
Father we were doing so well.

146
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,041
We lost most of our cast
and still had a hit.

147
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,916
Layla you've already done
more than enough for them.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,583
If you're worried
about your career,

149
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,250
I'll set up a management
office just for you.

150
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,583
It's about time you left this
circus business behind, anyway.

151
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
Now you can do
what you want to do.

152
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,458
Why don't you star
in another movie?

153
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,000
I understand that
last one you were in

154
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,291
got some pretty good
reviews. What do you say?

155
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,125
I don't think you understand how
much Kaleido Stage means to me

156
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,875
and to everyone else
who's worked to be there.

157
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,166
So that's what this is all
about. Well, I guess I was

158
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,125
foolish for thinking I could
stop you from working for Yuri.

159
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,375
No, that's not what I want.

160
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,708
Layla It's starting to
sound like you don't know

161
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,125
what you want.

162
00:09:54,208 --> 00:10:00,250
I just I don't want to lose...
I've never, not once in

163
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:05,500
all these years, had a partner
that's motivated me this much.

164
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,958
My partner...

165
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,708
If you don't want
to work for Yuri,

166
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,416
you'll have to forget
about the circus.

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,791
I don't know if I can.

168
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,125
Well, at any rate,

169
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,041
the Kaleido Stage you want
is closing down tonight.

170
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,416
There's nothing
I can do about it.

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,333
I understand. 

172
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,833
Layla. When you look back
you're going to be grateful

173
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,750
for all the help I've
given you in your career.

174
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,125
Yes.

175
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,791
So tonight's our last show...

176
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,208
I can't believe it.

177
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,541
We've gotta put everything
we've got into it.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,916
I'm afraid I'll start crying
during the performance.

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,125
I know how you feel.
It's just so sad.

180
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,541
Quit that!

181
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,083
Listen: if you're going
to cry during the show,

182
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,333
it's best that
you don't go on at all.

183
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,750
Look, this is your last
chance to do a show

184
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,500
you really care about,
so do it well.

185
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,625
We can't go on looking
how we feel right now.

186
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,958
Ken is right. We've gotta
make this show the best one

187
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,125
really pour in everything
we've got into it because

188
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,208
it's gonna be the real
Kaleido Stage's last show.

189
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,958
I mean, we want the audience
to walk out of here remembering

190
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,666
the good stuff
about Kaleido Stage!

191
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,916
Sora's right.
Let's kick some butt!

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,375
We've got too much
to do to be sad.

193
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,208
Thanks a lot, Ken, for
snapping us out of that.

194
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,166
I'm just here to help, Sora.

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,791
The Boss must feel worse
than we do. I wonder what

196
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,166
he's going to do now that
his dream, his Kaleido Stage,

197
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,291
is going to be taken
away from him forever.

198
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,750
Hey, I know--

199
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll tell him how we feel
about doing this last show!

200
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
It's Sora.

201
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,500
Come in.

202
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,041
Excuse me...

203
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,708
Everybody was talking backstage
a little while ago about how sad

204
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,291
we are to close this show.

205
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,375
I'd like you to know that, even
though this is our last show--

206
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,916
or, really, because this is our
last show-- we're gonna give it

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,541
everything we've got.

208
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,083
Is there anything you want me

209
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,208
to say to the cast
before we go on stage?

210
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,250
I guess there's one thing you
can tell them: if that's how

211
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:45,958
they think of the show it's
better not to go on at all.

212
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,666
But... what do you mean by that?

213
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,666
We just wanted to do our best
because this is the last show

214
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,125
we'll perform at Kaleido Stage.

215
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,875
Are you saying that's wrong?

216
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,541
That we shouldn't try
to make the audience happy?

217
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,458
That we shouldn't
try to do our best?

218
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,708
I guess Kaleido Stage

219
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,083
is going to be over
because it should be...

220
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,583
What are you saying?!

221
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,583
We're trying to do our best
here, Boss! We're just...

222
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,041
I'm disappointed in you, Sora.

223
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:25,208
I just don't understand.
What else can we do?

224
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,541
I'm disappointed in you, Sora.

225
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,041
I don't get it. What else
does he want me to do?

226
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,458
Sora?

227
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,708
Yes?

228
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,583
What are you doing out here?

229
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,625
I've been looking
all over for you.

230
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,833
Sorry.

231
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,000
Wow I can't believe
he'd say that to you.

232
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,166
What should I do? It's our last
show and now now I feel like

233
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,333
maybe he's right, maybe we
shouldn't go on stage at all.

234
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Come on, Sora, Kalos was upset.
But that shouldn't stop you

235
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,916
from doing a job you know
you'll all be proud of.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,333
Yeah.

237
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,291
If you don't pull yourself
together the whole show's

238
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,083
gonna fall apart, Sora.

239
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:31,291
Sorry Ken. I need to go back
to my room for a second.

240
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,250
Oh. Okay. Just be back in
time for curtain, all right?

241
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:47,875
Fool? Where are you? Fool?

242
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,708
Where are you hiding? Don't tell
me I can't see you anymore.

243
00:14:53,791 --> 00:15:00,791
Oh, no. It can't be... Fool!
Come on! Don't hide from me!

244
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:05,375
I've got something I need to ask
you! This isn't funny anymore.

245
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,416
Why won't you come out? Please,
Fool, I don't understand what

246
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,166
the Boss wants me to do.
Fool! Please, answer me!

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,916
I can't believe it. It happened.
I can't see the Fool anymore...

248
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,541
Listen, if you can see me

249
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,166
it means that you were
chosen for the stage.

250
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,416
There was a man who

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,708
was able to see me but
then he injured himself.

252
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,041
The man that I was just
telling you about gradually

253
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,708
became unable to see me, Sora.

254
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,208
First, I can't stay at Kaleido
Stage. Then the Boss says

255
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:48,375
he's disappointed in me. And now
I can't see the Fool anymore.

256
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,875
It feels like everything's
slipping away from me and

257
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,916
I can't get it back.
I don't know what to do...

258
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,416
So much has happened to me
since I came to Kaleido Stage,

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,416
but even when someone got angry
with me or when I made some

260
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
kind of mistake I've never
felt this bad about it.

261
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,833
I know the reason I can't
see the Fool anymore is that

262
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,416
I'll never have the
chance to perfect

263
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,750
the legendary great maneuver.

264
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,166
But nothing's
changed inside of me,

265
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,291
I still want to be
as good as Layla is.

266
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,583
I just don't know how
to make that happen...

267
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,041
Today's performance might be the
last time I star opposite Layla.

268
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,750
Mia, Anna and I have always
pushed each other to be better,

269
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,458
but now it's like
we've wasted our time.

270
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,541
And I was hoping that someday

271
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,000
we could perform
another routine together.

272
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,541
But I guess now that
Kaleido Stage is ending

273
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,541
that won't be possible...

274
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,916
I thought I thought the best
way to deal with this was just

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
to give 'Freedom' all we've got.

276
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,291
But the Boss said if I feel that
way it's better not to perform.

277
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,333
But I have to perform! No matter
how I feel, the show must go on!

278
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,833
That's right! 

279
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,083
But when I think of today
being our last performance--

280
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,375
Huh?

281
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,166
Thank you.

282
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,500
Layla?

283
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,916
We won't be seeing
each other again.

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,375
Not necessarily.

285
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,000
I can still talk to your
father if you like, Layla.

286
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,416
I know you don't want this
to be your last performance

287
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,333
at Kaleido Stage. You're
devoted to this place.

288
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,125
Today is not going to be
our last show, Yuri.

289
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,625
Layla take a look
around you. It's over.

290
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,750
Did you even see our production
before you shut it down?

291
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:11,500
'Our production?' I've never
heard you talk like that before.

292
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,708
Anyway, I figured the show
wasn't worth wasting my time on.

293
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,458
Then I'll tell you the story. 

294
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,666
It's about a group

295
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,541
of young people who
believe in the future.

296
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,250
All the characters, every
one of them, want to make

297
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,666
a better life for themselves,
and that's why they're fighting.

298
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,875
The character I'm playing
has that kind of hope, too.

299
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,208
She really believes that
she can make a better future

300
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,750
for herself and her friends.

301
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,916
That's what holds the groups
together. If a problem arises,

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,500
they do their best
to solve it-- together.

303
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,958
They don't despair,
they keep working.

304
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,958
I think I think that's
what I like about the show.

305
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,416
You may be able to close
Kaleido Stage down,

306
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,291
but don't think that means I'll
never be able to perform again.

307
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,458
This isn't my last show
unless I choose for it to be.

308
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:07,166
I know that that's true,
Yuri. If I didn't believe that,

309
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,291
I don't think I'd have the
heart to go on stage today.

310
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,083
I never thought you'd buy
into that sentimental tripe.

311
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,916
You call it that because
you don't believe the future

312
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,416
has anything good
in store for you.

313
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,041
Layla!

314
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,333
Sora?

315
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,791
I overheard what you
said to Yuri just now.

316
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,500
You really think today
isn't the end. Now I do, too.

317
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:44,625
I was afraid I'd never get
to be on stage with you again.

318
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,458
But, like you said, that won't
happen unless I want it to.

319
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,458
You were right,
Layla, you were!

320
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,791
Sora, we have a show to do.

321
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,041
And we don't want to be
late for the performance.

322
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,666
Right.

323
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,291
We're not doing our best
because this is the last show.

324
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,708
We'll continue doing our best,
even after today.

325
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,083
We do our best because
we have hope for the future.

326
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,666
Right!

327
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,000
The audience isn't interested
in seeing us be sad out there.

328
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,583
That's the truth.

329
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,458
I think that's what the Boss was
trying to tell me earlier today.

330
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,750
Oh yeah, you're probably right.

331
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,583
Sounds like you're back
to your old self again.

332
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,375
And, you know,
I've been thinking:

333
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,375
Layla is really amazing.

334
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,333
I just I don't want to lose...
I've never, not once in all

335
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,625
these years, had a partner
that's motivated me this much.

336
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,500
If you don't want
to work for Yuri,

337
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,708
you'll have to forget
about the circus.

338
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,375
I don't know if I can.

339
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,041
Oh, just thinking
about how Layla told him

340
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,500
'This isn't my last show
unless I want it to be.'

341
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:46,750
It makes me so emotional
I feel like crying. I--

342
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:50,041
Oh, no, my makeup. Go on,
I'll catch up with you!

343
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,291
Layla?

344
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,458
Where's Sora?

345
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,041
She, uh, messed up
her make-up and uh...

346
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,375
She's in there fixing it.

347
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,125
Sora.

348
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:09,250
Oh, Layla, I I'm trying
to hurry, but I just,

349
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,541
I don't know how...

350
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,625
I can help you with that.

351
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,708
Let me fix it for you, okay?

352
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,666
But Layla, I can do--

353
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,833
Stop talking, Sora. I'll
be finished in a minute.

354
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,458
I've enjoyed performing with
you. I wanted to let you know.

355
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,166
But, Layla... Why would
she say something like that?

356
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,500
This isn't the end,
it can't be. Or is it?

357
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,291
There finished. Sora let's go.

358
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,291
Right.

359
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,916
Fool, you--

360
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,333
Here I am. So you
can see me again?

361
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,791
Yeah. Thought I got rid of you.

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,166
The Sun. This card means you
should have hope for tomorrow.

363
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,291
Hope for tomorrow. That's great!

364
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,625
After this is when our real
performances are going to start.

365
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,208
Sora, don't be ridiculous. How
can you expect me not to worry?

366
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,833
All of us got
kicked out of the dorms,

367
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,291
so I had to go stay at Ken's
house for a little while.

368
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,708
And then Sora's parents

369
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,625
came to visit because
they were worried about her...

370
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,708
And they had a surprise for her.

371
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,291
They're going to have a baby.

372
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,958
My parents are finally going
to have a child of their own.

373
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,666
But where does that leave me?

374
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,583
Where, where, where?!
Join us next time for,

375
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,500
'Amazing Family Ties.'

376
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,125
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky...
