1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,916
Attention everyone.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,958
Kaleido Star is about to begin.

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,416
While watching Kaleido
Star, keep your room lit

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,791
and sit away from the TV.

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:27,958
Right Miss!

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,083
Hey everyone!

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,291
Cathy here.

8
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,958
You kids don't know
how good you've got it.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,166
When you're young it's easier
to push yourselves to extremes.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,916
You can shoot for the stars!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,125
For example, look at everyone
here at Kaleido Stage!

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,583
Everyone's determined
to achieve their dream.

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,125
Nothing can get in their way.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,416
All this dream chasing is
making for one amazing show!

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,666
Alright, I'm getting revved up.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,125
Hope you kids are ready
coz I'm sticking through

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,250
with you 'til the end!

18
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,125
I've changed my mind
about training.

19
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,458
We'll start again tomorrow.

20
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:40,958
Yes sir!

21
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:53,958
You need to get up.

22
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,541
We're wasting time.

23
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes sir.

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,083
She must be sore
from those weights,

25
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,041
she's been training all day!

26
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,541
Do you want to take a break?

27
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,875
No.

28
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,500
Sora...

29
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,625
Why does she have to keep

30
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,541
training until she
collapses like that?

31
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,875
I have to... keep going.

32
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,541
"Our Amazing Futures."

33
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,666
Simon Park has agreed to write
Swan Lake's press release.

34
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,000
Hmm.

35
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,250
That's one problem fixed,
but what about Layla?

36
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,916
I've made it clear that I'm not
going to try and stop Layla.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,916
You're a real piece of work.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,291
A "Perfect Angel's Maneuver"
requires innate instinct.

39
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,541
What makes you think
that Layla has the strength

40
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,625
to pull this off, Kalos?

41
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,208
How will the audience react to
someone who suddenly comes back

42
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,208
to the stage to make
a second attempt at stardom?

43
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,333
She had a brilliant exit.

44
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,000
This could ruin her reputation!

45
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,666
Are you going to be
the one to tell her?

46
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,208
I'm certainly gonna try.

47
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,583
But, if she won't give up...

48
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,416
I'll just have to ruin my
reputation along with her.

49
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,583
So whaddya think?

50
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,083
During the performance,

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,916
I wanna use lasers in the
areas where I've put markers.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,208
Well, I... I think the
design is pretty good,

53
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,333
but I feel like it's
missing something...

54
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,375
Just get to the point
and tell him it's no good.

55
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,208
Cathy!

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,375
I never said it was no good!

57
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,625
So you're saying it's good?!

58
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,500
Well no...

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,916
Then that means it's no good.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,791
I guess so.

61
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,666
I see.

62
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,958
I'm sorry Jean.

63
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,916
There's no need
for you to apologize.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Yes there is,
we know who's at fault!

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,666
Yeah, I know, it's my fault.

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,166
I still haven't completely
worked out how we're going

67
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,833
to stage the climax of the show.

68
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,083
What are you gonna do?

69
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,416
We can't build the set
'til you figure it out.

70
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,583
I'll start working on it now.

71
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,083
That's my girl,
give it your best shot!

72
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,500
You can figure this thing out
if you keep working at it!

73
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,250
Keep working at it until
you collapse like Sora!

74
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,583
I'm gonna keep working at it
until I collapse like Sora!

75
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,458
She's right, I gotta keep going.

76
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,666
It all depends on me.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,791
Wow, the seal really loved it.

78
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,375
Does that mean... its good?

79
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,916
I'm not really sure...

80
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
The only way Odile
can express her love

81
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,875
is through her hatred of Odette.

82
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,166
That means, if she
destroys Odette,

83
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,958
she wouldn't be able
to express her love again.

84
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,041
When Sora wasn't onstage,
I couldn't perform my best

85
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,500
because I had no one
to compete with.

86
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,791
I am Odile.

87
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,916
Odile's relationship with

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,708
the prince is like my
relationship with the stage.

89
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,708
Odile will never win the
prince's love as long as

90
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,500
she keeps trying
to defeat Odette.

91
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,041
The difference between
Odette and Odile...

92
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,666
Odile is obsessed with
winning the prince's affection,

93
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,375
and she won't let
anything stand in her way.

94
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,708
But Odette values her love
for the prince more than

95
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,791
she values herself, and
strives to make him happy.

96
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,000
Sora's love for the stage

97
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,125
is more important
to her than anything.

98
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,791
As long as I keep trying to
defeat Sora, I'll never win.

99
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,833
Pose number nine.

100
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,416
Yes sir!

101
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,375
You care more about the
stage than you do yourself.

102
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,125
That means she's
just like... Odette.

103
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,375
This special training seems

104
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,791
to get more and more
difficult every day.

105
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,583
Hello?

106
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,291
Can I come in?

107
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,083
Oh, hi!

108
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,666
I'll tell her you're here.

109
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,791
Miss Layla, Mr. Yuri's outside!

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,333
You can let him in.

111
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay.

112
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,958
Sorry for the wait,
I'll be right there.

113
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,750
Thank you for waiting.

114
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,125
Come in.

115
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,083
Miss Layla is in the
practice room in the basement.

116
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,458
Thank you.

117
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,708
Why are you so stubborn?

118
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,958
If you're not
going to be my partner,

119
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,875
you might as well leave now.

120
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,041
I don't get it.

121
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,083
Attempting to make
a comeback is rough.

122
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,166
You'll either be praised
for your determination,

123
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,916
or you'll be laughed off stage.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They'll think you're trying
to steal the spotlight.

125
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,458
From... the people
you've left behind.

126
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,166
I don't care what anyone thinks.

127
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,875
I have to do this Yuri.

128
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,666
I don't have a choice.

129
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,458
So I guess you're too
exhausted to take a bath, huh?

130
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,333
Huh?

131
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,166
What's that?

132
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,500
What are you trying to say?

133
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,000
Did you say you want me
to help you get undressed?

134
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,875
Massage... will you... please?

135
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,500
How's this feel?

136
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,875
Am I going it right?

137
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,541
It's not helping.

138
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,208
Never mind.

139
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,125
Thanks though.

140
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,166
Ouch.

141
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,875
That really hurt.

142
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,041
You mean like this?

143
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,416
Hey, there's a bar
at the bottom!

144
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,666
That's for you to stand on.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
Okay.

146
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,833
Sora, are you ready to begin?

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,416
Yeah!

148
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,166
Looks like this part of
training is gonna be harsh.

149
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,750
No matter what, you have to
maintain your pose on the bar.

150
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,041
Yes sir!

151
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,125
Hey Rosetta!

152
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,541
What is it?

153
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,791
I'm thinking about making
my move during the climax

154
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
a two-person maneuver.

155
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,125
Really?

156
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,250
I already talked
to Cathy about it.

157
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,250
Yeah?

158
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,625
You are so dense.

159
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,583
You're my partner, so we've
gotta start practicing.

160
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,875
Hold on a second!

161
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,541
I told you I wasn't gonna
be in the show, May!

162
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,041
I know.

163
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,875
But are you really
okay with that?

164
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,125
I made my decision.

165
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,250
I thought you were
as determined as Sora.

166
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,583
But I guess that
I was wrong about you.

167
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,041
Sora's determined to have

168
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,916
a brilliant performance
no matter what.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Even if it's her last one.

170
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,250
By the time I finally
made it to Kaleido Stage,

171
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,916
Miss Layla had already
left the troupe.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,333
I was so sad and disappointed.

173
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,541
The maneuver I'm thinking about
can't be done by one person,

174
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,000
so I'm giving you
the chance I never had.

175
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,166
But if you don't want to do it,

176
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,291
I'll start looking
for someone else.

177
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,708
What'll you do?

178
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,000
If you wanna do this,
then I'll train you.

179
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,375
But just so you know,
it will be hard.

180
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,458
Alright.

181
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,791
I'll do it.

182
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,166
I'll be your partner, May.

183
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,583
Good decision.

184
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,291
Her balance has started
to improve a little.

185
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,500
But, she isn't comfortable
landing the pose.

186
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,000
The "Angel's Maneuver" still
isn't ready for the stage.

187
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,666
I don't know if Sora can survive
much more of this training.

188
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,333
That's it!

189
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,291
How about a little
change of scene?

190
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,375
Huh?

191
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,541
Cathy?

192
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,500
Where are we going
at this time of night?

193
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,041
You'll just have to wait
and see when we get there!

194
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,208
I guess the seal
really liked it, huh?

195
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,458
Yeah.

196
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,916
If only we could fill
the audience with seals.

197
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,041
Mia, take a look.

198
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,625
Yeah?

199
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,958
They're real swans!

200
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,208
You got it.

201
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,458
Mother Nature is
the best director.

202
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,958
Sometimes it's good for us to
sit back and be her audience.

203
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,916
You're right.

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,791
I thought seeing them may
help you picture your angel.

205
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,458
An angel that doesn't fight.

206
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,458
An angel who can forgive
the hatred in her heart.

207
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,958
I thought that Sora was
perfect for the role, but...

208
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,416
It's almost too perfect.

209
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,750
Yeah.

210
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,166
I mean, I know that sounds
weird since I wrote it.

211
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,750
I can understand.

212
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,583
See, I've always
been more like May.

213
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,458
Charging into everything
headfirst is more my style.

214
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,083
I made fun of people
who said things like

215
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,500
"Let's all be friends
and do this together!"

216
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,250
"Those people are just cowards
who are afraid of getting hurt!"

217
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,750
I thought.

218
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,250
Sora... she's different from
those people I made fun of.

219
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,375
When I tried to make her
compete with May, she refused.

220
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,083
May thought she was
running away, but I could see

221
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,041
the fire in Sora's eyes, and
I knew that wasn't the case.

222
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,250
Some of the troupe members,
they've told me they don't

223
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,666
understand why Sora won't
stand up and compete with May.

224
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,458
They think she'd be more
humble if Sora beat her.

225
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,333
You know the people who are
telling you those things are

226
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,291
the people who don't have the
courage to fight themselves.

227
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,083
Those people make up about
80% of the population.

228
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,500
It's a lost cause.

229
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,166
I guess.

230
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,958
Remember the time Leon
pulled Sora onstage?

231
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,208
She gave a wonderful performance
even though May came after her.

232
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,583
There was something
thrilling about her.

233
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,416
I never felt the weakness of
someone who was running away.

234
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,583
But now it feels like

235
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,500
Sora's fighting against
herself somehow.

236
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,333
Maybe she's afraid.

237
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,166
I mean, maybe she fears that the
competition will never stop.

238
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,625
And she's constantly
battling that fear.

239
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,166
Look!

240
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,541
They're so beautiful!

241
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,583
That makes sense.

242
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,833
If her goal hadn't been
a stage without competition,

243
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,208
then it's possible she might
not have been able to come back

244
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,083
to the Kaleido Stage
when she did.

245
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,791
The force of the wave,
the force of the wind,

246
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,250
the force of the boat.

247
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,708
So many different forces
fighting each other.

248
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,083
This is more complicated than
the trapeze could ever be.

249
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,333
Try to sense the flow of each
of the different forces.

250
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,208
Don't think.

251
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,416
Feel it with your body.

252
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,166
Feel it with my body?

253
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,375
That's right.

254
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,875
If you can master that,

255
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,041
you'll always be able to land
your pose after you jump.

256
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,750
Yes sir!

257
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,250
Just make sure that
you hold your pose.

258
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,250
That's Sora for you.

259
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,541
She's on the right track now.

260
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,625
These trapeze are different
than at the Noir Circus.

261
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,291
That means you'll have
to use different timing

262
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,708
than you did then, got it?

263
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,375
Yes ma'am.

264
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,791
You can't let your body relax.

265
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,833
You keep slipping because you're
not picturing your next move.

266
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,375
You're the fairy of light.

267
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,125
Your role is to guide Odile
off the dark path of hatred

268
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,083
that she wandered down.

269
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,083
I have to try to show
the audience that Odile

270
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,208
is attempting to
overcome her own hatred.

271
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,750
Even though the only way she
can do that is with guidance

272
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
from a stronger power.

273
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,291
May...

274
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,416
You'll never be
a stronger power if you keep

275
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
performing this weakly!

276
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,916
We need to get this
basic stuff over with.

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,875
We have to move on to
our special training for

278
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,000
the Eternal Illusion.

279
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,083
"Eternal Illusion"?

280
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,500
So close.

281
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,875
Sorry about that.

282
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,291
I guess my timing was
just too fast on that one.

283
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,666
I can't believe you've
come this far on your own.

284
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,291
It's not perfect if I still
have to think about it.

285
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,083
I need to start
sensing it with my body.

286
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,291
Start changing the way you
channel your strength each time.

287
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,250
Do it like you would on stage.

288
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,541
Okay.

289
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,541
Thank you Sarah,
this is warming me up.

290
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,541
I figured I'd try cooking
some pork miso soup for you.

291
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,666
I hope you like it!

292
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,583
Is it yummy?

293
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,250
I'm sorry to say
I'm so exhausted

294
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,041
that I can't really taste it.

295
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,375
Oh, that's a shame!

296
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,375
I think this is
my best creation ever!

297
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,750
I even experimented
with adding fresh cream.

298
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,541
How is it, is it nice?

299
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,166
It's probably a good thing
I can't taste it.

300
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,208
Oh brilliant, Leon
would like a bowl too!

301
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,375
No.

302
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,958
The swans...
Mother Nature... an angel...

303
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,875
That's not it!

304
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,125
Eugh, why is this so hard!

305
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,875
What if I did
a goofy run like this?

306
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,416
The question is, do you
think the seal will like it?

307
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,916
Listen, the seal doesn't
have to like it, okay?

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,125
Oh, right!

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,291
This is agonizing.

310
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,458
I almost feel
like running away.

311
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,916
I think she's been
pushed to her limit.

312
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,125
The last time I felt like this
was when I was training for

313
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,166
the "Legendary Great Maneuver".

314
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,125
I was in so much pain.

315
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,125
The only reason
I could keep going

316
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,625
was because Layla led me on.

317
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,416
But Layla did it all on her own.

318
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,208
She didn't have
anyone to guide her.

319
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,750
She did it without
anyone's help.

320
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,000
She's not...

321
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,916
She did it!

322
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,583
So beautiful!

323
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,625
Layla.

324
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,833
She's an amazing performer.

325
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,541
With time,
it can only get better.

326
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,041
Huh?

327
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,250
This show is gonna
be really good!

328
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
Make sure to come and see it!

329
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,791
Do you think we could see
the lead, Sora Naegino?

330
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,291
Are you a fan of Sora's?

331
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,666
You could say that.

332
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,000
She's kinda busy lately.

333
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,041
She's been training at sea.

334
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,625
There she is!

335
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,083
Wha wha what's that
maneuver she's practicing?

336
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,916
It looks like it's part of
the "Angel's Maneuver".

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,791
Pretty!

338
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,583
Amazing!

339
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,708
She looks like an angel.

340
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,083
She is an angel!

341
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,500
Wow!

342
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,041
I just got the greatest idea!

343
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,583
How could I make it work?

344
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:23,041
The only way to beat Sora is to
do my very best playing Odile.

345
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,041
I'm gonna help make
this show the best ever.

346
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,041
I'll finally make my dream
come true on this stage.

347
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,000
Everyone's heart is
starting to become one.

348
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,208
Leon.

349
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,625
That's the stage
of a True Star.

350
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,416
Sophie.

351
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,166
It looks like I'll be able
to keep my promise.

352
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,000
I promise to keep practicing
right up until opening day!

353
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm gonna make the true Kaleido
Star a reality, no matter what!

354
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,833
Hold on.

355
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,125
There's another candidate
of the role of Odette.

356
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,541
No way.

357
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,416
Tomorrow we'll hold an audition
for the role of Odette.

358
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

359
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:05,666
An audition?

360
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,416
Could it be?

361
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,083
Sora's perfect for that.

362
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,625
Is it May?

363
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:12,625
Who is it?

364
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,750
Who is that?

365
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,916
It's Layla!

366
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,291
The competition is on, Sora.

367
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,791
And if you don't like it,
you'd better step down.

368
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,416
After all this time.

369
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,916
I never dreamed a day
like this would come.

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,166
I'm here because of
my admiration for you.

371
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,416
Your kindness and your cruelty.

372
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,208
The bond that we felt
that special day.

373
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,583
Do you remember?

374
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,041
I'll never forget.

375
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,166
Look at how far I've come.

376
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,000
Next time on Kaleido Star:

377
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,916
"A Most Amazing and
Inescapable Showdown".

378
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,833
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
