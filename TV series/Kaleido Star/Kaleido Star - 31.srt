1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,708
Hey everyone,
Kaleido Star's about to start,

2
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,208
so make sure that your
room is brightly lit,

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:27,750
and that you're not
sitting too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,666
Well, well, well.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,916
Do any of you out
there have a rival?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,541
You know, someone you
just don't want to lose to?

7
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,416
With someone like that around,
you improve pretty quickly.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,791
As for me, I wanted
to be like Layla.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,500
I kept pushing myself
to be a better performer.

10
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,833
I've been trying to do
well for my own sake.

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,708
And I've worked really hard,

12
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,000
but I never really felt that I
didn't want to lose to someone.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,333
But ever since May
joined Kaleido Stage,

14
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,125
oh I don't wanna say anymore.

15
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,208
I don't! I don't!

16
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,375
Dracula?

17
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,666
Right, Dracula.

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
I got the idea when
I was looking at Leon.

19
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,541
This has just got to
be our new production.

20
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,125
Is it a horror story?

21
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,958
If it's a horror story, that
means there won't be any gags.

22
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course there won't!

23
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,166
"The Amazing Passionate Rival."

24
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,791
Most people think that
this is just a scary story,

25
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,125
but it's a beautiful
love story, too.

26
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,750
It has a love story?

27
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,916
Yes!

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,750
Dracula wanders around
night after night

29
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,875
searching for the blood
of beautiful women.

30
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
Then, he meets the
beautiful Mina Murray,

31
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,625
who finds herself
strangely attracted to him.

32
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,125
Guided by fate, the two of them
end up together in the end!

33
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,083
How romantic!

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,250
It's so sweet!

35
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,041
It's not what it
looks like, Sora!

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,000
That's really good, Mia!

37
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,083
We've never done anything
like that before.

38
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,625
What you just said gave me
a little more confidence.

39
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,083
This is the first time
I've written a script

40
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,333
with someone in mind.

41
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,166
How can there be no gags?

42
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,875
Mina Murray.

43
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,666
Layla could have played
that role beautifully.

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,166
Remember, you're the one who's
the Kaleido Star now, Sora.

45
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,166
I know, but my part was
decreased again yesterday.

46
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,291
I wrote the character of
Mina with you in mind.

47
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,875
With me?

48
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,000
I even put in a spin maneuver,
since those are your specialty.

49
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,000
When Leon sees your Mina Murray,

50
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,666
even he won't wanna
decrease your stage time!

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,000
After all, you're the one
who changed his mind

52
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,625
about going home to France.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,875
So it's not like he
doesn't acknowledge you.

54
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,041
Be confident.

55
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,333
That's right.

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,708
Thank you.

57
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,125
You've got a point.

58
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,958
If I wanna live up to
Layla's expectations...

59
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:26,041
This time, I wanna be
like someone else.

60
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,166
I wanna be the one who
performs on stage with Sora.

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,375
And... I have to work
hard for Rosetta, too.

62
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,750
After all, she came here because
she wants to be like you.

63
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,875
What's Rosetta doing right now?

64
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,583
She's studying in her room.

65
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:40,958
In her room?

66
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,625
She told me that ever since
she started performing,

67
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,708
she's always been
tutored by a computer.

68
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,250
I heard that she's never
been to a real school.

69
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,416
It sounds like she's
been through a lot.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,375
Mia, thank you for this.

71
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,791
I'd be honored to do it.

72
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,041
Yeah, go Sora!

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,750
What do you think, Leon?

74
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,875
I think it sounds interesting.

75
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,541
I'll be Dracula?

76
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,416
Right, so what do you think?

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,666
This is the first time someone's
captured me in this light.

78
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,416
Uh, so does that mean you,
in other words...

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,958
I'll ask you to revise it,
but it sounds like a challenge.

80
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,250
What? Do you mean it?

81
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,083
Congratulations!

82
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,708
Thanks you guys!

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,208
Good job, Mia!

84
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,625
You got Mr. Oswald's approval.
You're something else!

85
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh thank you, I feel so great!

86
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,333
I want you to revise it now.

87
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,333
Sure, what is it you'd
like me to change?

88
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,500
Get rid of Mina's character.

89
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,291
Get rid of her?
You mean all of it?

90
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,625
That's exactly what I mean.

91
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,958
But I- Mina Murray's
climax, the Screw Spin,

92
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,083
is an extremely
difficult maneuver,

93
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,083
and I think Sora
can pull it off.

94
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,375
I think the audience would
enjoy watching the maneuver

95
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,000
as the highlight of the show.

96
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,583
Satisfy me, instead of
satisfying the audience.

97
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,000
If you can't do that,
I'll rewrite the show myself.

98
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,875
I'd like for you to see
my Screw Spin first.

99
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,250
I'm sure I can show
you a performance

100
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,666
that you'd be pleased with.

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,500
Double Door Open!

102
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
May, wha-?

103
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,166
Just give up.

104
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,416
The only person who can satisfy
Leon is the next Layla Hamilton!

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,041
And that's me!

106
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,916
Wait a second, I wrote
this part with Sora in mind

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,166
from the beginning.

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,833
So what's your point, Mia?

109
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,166
The person who has
the best trapeze skills

110
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,500
should get the role.
And in this case,

111
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:39,416
that person's none other than
yours truly, me, May Wong!

112
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,833
She's so self-centered.

113
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,791
Huh?

114
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,500
I'll give you both a day.

115
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,458
Either of you would do,
just satisfy me.

116
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,500
You're just giving them one day?

117
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,250
No one said they had to do it.

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,708
Oh no, just leave it to me!

119
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,500
I'll go ahead and get
the swing ready tonight,

120
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
so you can practice
first thing tomorrow.

121
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,583
Finally, it's time for
a real competition.

122
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,083
He said we have only one day,

123
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,958
and there's just one swing
for us to practice on.

124
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,208
That means I'll only have
half a day to practice.

125
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,458
With her abilities, May might be
able to master the Screw Spin.

126
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,583
But I can't allow myself
to lose this game.

127
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,958
I will win this
game by all means!

128
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,458
With Layla gone, the only person
who can be a Kaleido Star is me.

129
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,708
It can't be anyone else.

130
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,125
Ahh!

131
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,791
What's going on?

132
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,291
What are you doing?

133
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,791
Powerful Pushing!

134
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,041
What are you talking about?

135
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,875
It's feng shui.

136
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,250
Huh?

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,833
If I move into this room
for the next couple of days,

138
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,583
I'll have a better chance
of winning the contest.

139
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,958
How stupid.

140
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,500
So I'll be moving
into this room,

141
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,750
but it's only for
the next couple of days.

142
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,708
Well, I'm gonna start
bringing in my stuff.

143
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,583
Fire Cooking!

144
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,291
In order to win, I need
the heat of a fire.

145
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,708
Cooking stir-fry is
perfect for that.

146
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,833
It looks like our
menu has changed.

147
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,125
We'll be having Chinese food...

148
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,541
We're having Chinese
food for breakfast? Eew.

149
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,041
Greasy Chinese food...

150
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,916
Hey, it's nice to have something
different once in a while,

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,375
and May went through the
trouble of cooking for us...

152
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,166
She was only
cooking for herself.

153
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,958
Don't worry,
I'll make breakfast.

154
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,250
It'll just be a minute.

155
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,375
Good morning!

156
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,000
Morning, ladies.

157
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,583
So that's what the swing
for the Screw Spin is like.

158
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,791
And I finished it just in time.

159
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,125
Grand Screw Jump!

160
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,791
So close!

161
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,416
She's come a long way
in just one hour.

162
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,250
Yeah, and that's a really
difficult maneuver.

163
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,958
So I guess she's not
all talk after all.

164
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,000
Sora could do that if she was
able to practice for an hour.

165
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,000
Uh, yeah, right.

166
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,583
I don't know if I
could get that far,

167
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,750
but I have to try.

168
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,500
You're supposed to
take turns every hour.

169
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,500
So that means it's
your turn, Sora.

170
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,000
May, you've been here
longer than an hour.

171
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
It's time to switch with Sora.

172
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,041
I'm not going to do that!

173
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,166
What?

174
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,500
Uh, did you understand
what I said?

175
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,333
I got here a whole hour
earlier to start practice,

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,458
and she didn't.

177
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,500
But that's because
breakfast was late.

178
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,458
And now you saunter in and
shamelessly demand the swing.

179
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,041
You're so naive!

180
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,125
You refuse to let her practice?

181
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,208
What, afraid you
won't win otherwise?

182
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,708
You're just a coward.

183
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,708
Hmph. This isn't a
swing on a playground.

184
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,750
Why should I have to take turns?

185
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,541
I don't remember agreeing
to anything like that.

186
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,208
But usually people-

187
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,208
The early bird gets the worm.

188
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,041
This world is controlled
by the law of the jungle.

189
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,541
First of all,

190
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,916
Leon doesn't even acknowledge
you as a performer at all.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,666
I'm the only one who really
deserves to take the test.

192
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,500
I mean, I'd be ashamed if
he just asked me to take it

193
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,041
because he felt sorry for me.

194
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,208
--May!
--You're awful!

195
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,708
I can't believe
you just said that!

196
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,791
Sora, why don't you answer her?

197
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,375
As May pointed out,

198
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm still not acknowledged
by Mr. Oswald as a performer.

199
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,250
But regardless of that,
I'm still determined

200
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,541
to do my best to make
Kaleido Stage even better.

201
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,333
I'm gonna take the test
tomorrow, no matter what.

202
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,833
And I'm gonna give it
my all, like I always do.

203
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,291
I consider you a friend,

204
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,083
who can create great
new productions with me.

205
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,166
--That's why-
--Just stop it!

206
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,541
We're friends now?

207
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,291
That's preposterous.

208
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,375
Just looking at your
face makes me sick.

209
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,916
I hate the sight of you.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,416
Every single thing you've done

211
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,875
since I got here's
disappointing.

212
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,250
And yet, I don't know how-

213
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,083
how could the person who did
the legendary great maneuver

214
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,708
with Layla Hamilton
be someone like you?

215
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,333
If I had been here then,
without a doubt,

216
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,208
Layla would have
chosen me instead.

217
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,625
--But I...
--Oh, May.

218
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,708
I won't be outdone by you!

219
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,750
This test is going to prove
that I'm better than you,

220
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,875
once and for all!

221
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,375
At that time...

222
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,500
At that time, Layla and
I were truly partners.

223
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,833
And I could say without
a doubt that there was

224
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,666
nobody who could
be Layla's partner

225
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,666
and perform the legendary
great maneuver, besides me.

226
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,333
And it was true...

227
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,166
at that time...

228
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,416
I'm putting all my
faith in you, Sora.

229
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,250
Because I know you have what it
takes to be a true Kaleido Star.

230
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,833
Sometimes I wonder if
I have what it takes

231
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,625
to really be a star, Fool.

232
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,041
It's up to you, Sora.

233
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,750
What's a true
Kaleido Star, anyway?

234
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,791
Even I don't know the
answer for that one.

235
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,208
It's something you must
create for yourself,

236
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,750
but there is one thing
I know for sure:

237
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,583
you can still see me.

238
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,708
Sora, I wanna
show you something.

239
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,458
Ken, is that... the swing
for the Screw Spin?

240
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,875
Sora!

241
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,541
Sorry, I had to
build it quickly,

242
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
so it's not quite
tall enough, but...

243
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,875
Come on, Sora!

244
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,083
Sora, we want you to win!

245
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,125
Don't let someone
like May beat you!

246
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,333
Amazing.

247
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,375
We all helped to
build it, just for you.

248
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
So you could practice, Sora.

249
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,958
You did this for me?

250
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,416
That's right!

251
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,458
After all, I've still
got my heart set on

252
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,250
you playing Mina in the show.

253
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,916
It's not fair for you
to lose without even

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,583
having a chance to practice.

255
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,291
Mia, Anna...

256
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,583
And, go!

257
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,625
Sora's our Kaleido Star!

258
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,166
So, are you ready
to get started?

259
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,208
Thank you everybody!

260
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,083
I thought so.

261
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,083
Sora always bounces back.

262
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,625
It's thanks to you guys.

263
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,458
I promise to do my best.

264
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,541
That's right, I don't
have time to doubt myself.

265
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
I just have to do it.

266
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,625
The swing is...

267
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,625
Even someone as good as Sora's
having trouble with the timing.

268
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,958
She needs to get used to
how this swing works first.

269
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, I see.

270
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,250
The swing turns around easily,

271
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,875
but once it starts
spinning, it can't stop.

272
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,791
It spins too fast. I can't
tell when I should jump out.

273
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,708
But May was able to master
that much in an hour.

274
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,875
If I don't work hard now,

275
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,625
I won't be able to face
everyone who believes in me.

276
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,500
And I'll end up
disappointing Layla

277
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,000
who acknowledged me
as her partner.

278
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,416
Almost. I almost
got it that time.

279
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,666
Sora is Sagittarius.

280
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,250
May is Taurus.

281
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,708
Leon is Scorpio.

282
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:48,375
It's a beautiful balance,
but if this balance is lost...

283
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,458
One of them is destined
to fall from the heavens.

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I did it.

285
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,375
One more time
until it's perfect.

286
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,750
All right, let's go.

287
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:36,375
Huh? Oh no, I feel like
I have a temperature.

288
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,958
I wonder if it's
because of the rain.

289
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,833
What are you going to do?

290
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,625
What am I gonna do?

291
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,583
I have to do it! Yes! Yes!

292
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,583
All right, we're going
to start testing now.

293
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
First up is Sora.

294
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
Right!

295
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:15,208
Oh no, my body feels heavy,
and now I'm getting the chills.

296
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,000
But no matter what, I have
to give it my best shot.

297
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,666
I have to! I have to!

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,416
Oh no.

299
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,833
I'm starting to get dizzy.

300
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,916
I win.

301
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:11,000
Just as I suspected,
that's all you've got.

302
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,583
You were never cut out to
be Layla Hamilton's partner.

303
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,541
So, take this
opportunity to learn

304
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,750
how a real Kaleido
Star performs.

305
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,083
Beautiful.

306
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,916
No wait! Come back Mr. Oswald!

307
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,750
Please tell me what you
thought of my performance!

308
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,416
I did pass your test, didn't I?

309
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,333
It's not worth discussing.

310
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,208
Eh?

311
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,875
I don't understand.

312
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,958
I didn't make a single mistake.

313
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,541
I practiced really, really hard,

314
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,000
and my performance was
better than Sora's.

315
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,625
Why isn't that good enough?

316
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,333
Mr. Oswald has never practiced
the Screw Spin, and yet he's...

317
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,125
I wonder if he'll be able to
perform it without practicing.

318
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,791
Whoa.

319
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,000
Amazing.

320
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,833
Why are you so full of yourself,
just because you beat Sora?

321
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:15,000
You said you wanted to be
my partner, didn't you?

322
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,250
Then you'll have to shine
as brilliantly as I do.

323
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,375
Can you do it?

324
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,333
No, sir.

325
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,208
Our skill level
is too different.

326
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,375
Sora? You look feverish.

327
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,666
Oh, I am, but it's
not that bad really.

328
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,791
Are you kidding?

329
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,333
It's true, your face
is all red, Sora.

330
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,291
And that's why you
messed up, isn't it?

331
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,208
No, it's nothing like that.

332
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,166
Rewrite the script
for Dracula today.

333
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,208
I'll be the only star in it.

334
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,958
Mr. Oswald, Sora's
running a temperature.

335
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,333
No, wait...

336
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,791
She had to practice in
the rain all day yesterday.

337
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,250
Please, just give her
one more chance.

338
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,083
--Oh pretty please.
--You don't need to...

339
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,583
You people are all so soft.

340
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,500
So soft you make
me want to vomit.

341
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,875
Who knew Kaleido Stage would
foster this kind of weakness?

342
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,541
I think I'm beginning
to understand why

343
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,333
Layla Hamilton chose
you as a partner.

344
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,583
Because Layla Hamilton
was probably every bit

345
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,875
as soft as you people are.

346
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,708
She was a half-baked
leading lady

347
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,625
who couldn't lose her
rich girl attitude.

348
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,333
She couldn't be tough
on others or herself.

349
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,833
In the end,

350
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,250
she chose someone like you
for her partner and got hurt.

351
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,375
An easy place like Kaleido Stage
must've been perfect for her.

352
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,083
You don't know
anything about her!

353
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,666
You don't know anything!

354
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,250
I won't forgive you for saying
something like that about Layla!

355
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,375
Sora!

356
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,166
You can say whatever
you want about me,

357
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,916
but don't say those
things about her!

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,333
Layla is nothing, nothing
like you said she was.

359
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,291
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

360
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,625
It's not right.

361
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,416
Because of me, people
think badly of Layla.

362
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,208
I have no choice
but to work harder,

363
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,125
so people will think
that Layla was right

364
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,083
to choose me as a partner.

365
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,333
I found something I have to do.

366
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,250
I have to...

367
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,666
For that...

368
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,708
-I'll make him...
-I will make Leon...

369
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,458
-acknowledge me...
-acknowledge me...

370
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,708
-as worthy of being his partner.
-as worthy of being his partner.

371
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,708
I will show him when
I'm truly shining!

372
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,000
I failed at the
audition this time.

373
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,875
Wait a second, Sora.
May still hasn't given up yet.

374
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,708
Now she's gonna show off
by ice skating for him.

375
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,500
I've never ice skated
before in my whole life.

376
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,500
But this isn't the time for
giving up. It's not! It's not!

377
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,000
Next time on Kaleido Star:
'Amazing Match on Ice.'

378
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,375
My wings are my dream
and on toward the sky.
