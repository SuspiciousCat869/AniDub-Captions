1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,791
Hey-there, everyone,
Kaleido Star is about to start,

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,958
so make sure that
your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,458
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV, okay.

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,625
Well, well, well.
Everyone, it's Marion.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,500
Say, I'd like to know,
do you love your mom?

6
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,791
My mom's not around anymore.

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,958
She died in an accident
when I was little.

8
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,083
She was very good at
doing the trampoline.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,375
In fact, she was a star
at Kaleido Stage!

10
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,166
She was sweet and
very beautiful.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh, she was the best.

12
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,541
Even now, I still
love her very much.

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,125
And you know what?

14
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,291
I want to become a great woman
like my mom when I grow up, too!

15
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,416
Keep going after
my dream, she said.

16
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,875
So I guess Layla knows.

17
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,125
She knows that I've
lost sight of my dream.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,833
It's kind of fitting
she gave me that advice.

19
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,041
Layla was the one who
inspired me to join

20
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,791
Kaleido Stage in
the first place.

21
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,458
And when my only
dream in the world

22
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,125
was to become a
Kaleido Star like her,

23
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:12,000
all I had to do was chase
after Layla with all my might.

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,750
And for me to do that,

25
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,291
I was willing to do
just about anything,

26
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,708
no matter how hard it was.

27
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,125
But now, I don't
know what to do.

28
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,041
I don't have a dream anymore.

29
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,333
Sora!

30
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,875
Have you seen my dad?

31
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,458
Oh, wow! You're adorable.

32
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,500
Look at you all dressed up.
What's the big event, Marion?

33
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,500
Today, I'm going to see my mom.

34
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,166
"Marion's Amazing Debut."

35
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,166
Here are your favorite
flowers, Casablanca lilies.

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,625
Aren't they pretty?

37
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,291
I bought them for you
in a flower shop

38
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,291
at the corner of North and Main.

39
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,166
But the clerk in the store
there has a real attitude,

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,041
and she's always treating
me like I'm a little child.

41
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,666
Boy, she made me
so mad the other day.

42
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,375
So, I told her "Why don't
you at least be nice to me,

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,208
since I'm a paying customer?"

44
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:13,958
And then she--

45
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,416
Hey, hey!

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,666
Marion, if you try to tell
her everything all at once,

47
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,250
you're going to make Mom dizzy.

48
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,791
Oh, right. I'm sorry, Mom.

49
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,791
Jonathan, wait up!

50
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,833
It's been six years, Cynthia.

51
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,750
But it still feels
like you died yesterday.

52
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,333
So much has happened
in the meantime.

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,916
Marion is now 10 years old.

54
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,291
Jonathan!

55
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,750
Don't you think she's turned
out to be a beautiful girl?

56
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,166
Grand Screw Jump!

57
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,083
Oh, dear. What's the matter?

58
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,958
He's scary!

59
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,708
Dracula's scary!

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,625
Don't worry. It's just a play.

61
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,875
No! He's scary!

62
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,791
Hi, there. Are you okay?

63
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,666
Thank you for coming today.

64
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,083
The children are scared?

65
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,125
Mm-hmm.

66
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,916
Leon's Dracula is realistic

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,333
and that has made the show
popular with the audience,

68
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,666
but it seems that small children
are being really scared by it.

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,958
It's too bad they're
not enjoying the show.

70
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,833
Poor kids.

71
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,791
Then, I have no choice...

72
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't be your partner.

73
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,333
If only Kaleido Stage
could be the kind of place

74
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,875
where children
can enjoy the show

75
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,458
every bit as much
as the adults do.

76
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,166
The stage where everyone
can enjoy themselves...

77
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:19,458
I get it now...
A stage for the kids...

78
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,291
That's it!

79
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,500
Sora...?

80
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,416
Let's do it!

81
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,708
I'm going to assemble a
temporary stage around the pool.

82
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,833
Thanks, that'll be a big help.

83
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,041
It'll be ready for
practice tomorrow.

84
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,708
Is this show going
to be for kids?

85
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,208
Yeah, it is.

86
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,583
Saturdays, Sundays,

87
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,041
and between the matinee
and night shows of Dracula.

88
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,916
And it was Sora's bright idea.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,833
We're going to show
everyone just how much fun

90
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,333
Kaleido Stage really is.

91
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,416
We got the Boss'
permission, too.

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,083
We just need a cast.

93
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,791
A "Kids' Stage"?

94
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,666
Between the regular
performances?

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,958
That's right.
It'll add to our work,

96
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,958
but if we take turns
playing the parts,

97
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,375
I think we can pull it off.

98
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,041
C'est stupid.

99
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,125
Don't do it.

100
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,916
Why do you say that?

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,541
The current shows are
increasing our audience.

102
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,125
We do not need one more.

103
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,875
The children in our
audience should be able to

104
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,916
enjoy Kaleido Stage every
bit as much as the adults.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,041
That's the reason we need
something like Kids' Stage.

106
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,458
Instead of worrying
about something like that,

107
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,958
get the skills good
enough to satisfy me.

108
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,875
I agree it's important
for me to improve,

109
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,500
but I think Kids' Stage
is equally important.

110
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,166
You disobey me?!

111
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,458
I'm not gonna
give up Kids' Stage.

112
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:38,500
I can't believe this. She's
making me lose my composure.

113
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,708
You're a fool.

114
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,583
--Oh no.
--What are we gonna do?

115
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,708
May!

116
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:45,750
Thanks, but I would
rather concentrate

117
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,541
on the role I play now.

118
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,833
Besides, if I'm to be a
suitable partner for Leon,

119
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,583
I'll need to spend time
in special training

120
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,375
to improve my skills.

121
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:58,000
That's what I'll be doing
while you play with the kids.

122
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,958
--Sorry Sora.
--No way.

123
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,625
--I can't do this.
--Sorry.

124
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,166
Sorry Sora.

125
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,916
I thought everyone would be

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,208
eager to help out
with the Kids' Stage.

127
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,416
Sora, you can do this show
even with a small crew.

128
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,875
And you can count on
me to help you out.

129
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,208
Sarah!

130
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,250
Me, too.

131
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,458
Rosetta!

132
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,958
It's been a while since
I've had the chance

133
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,250
to perform in front of kids.

134
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,458
If you want,
we could do the trapeze.

135
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,041
Sorry, the show
doesn't have trapeze.

136
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,833
Oh, really? Well then,
I'll do diabolo.

137
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,166
A mortal blow!
Young Chick Style!

138
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,625
--Peep, peep...
--Excuse me...

139
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,083
If you don't mind...
I'd like for you to sing or...

140
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,500
--Peep!
--Any song, any song at all...

141
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,791
I want to educate the audience

142
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,625
about the world's
unknown martial arts.

143
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,875
--Uh, a song, please...
--PEEP!

144
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,625
You're amazing, Rosetta.

145
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,458
Finish it after that move.

146
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,000
Looks good.

147
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,083
Hey, Mia...

148
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,958
No gags, please.

149
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:20,041
How about if I fall on my face,
or something like that?

150
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,833
Uh, No.

151
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,375
Okay. Here I go!

152
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
Jonathan, get ready!

153
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,666
Here I go!

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,125
I'm really doing it this time!

155
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,333
He's doing his
best to ignore her.

156
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,750
Jonathan, give me
back that ball.

157
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,166
Jonathan! I'm waiting!

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,833
She doesn't notice.

159
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,458
Jonathan!

160
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,875
You're awful.

161
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,458
Marion!

162
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,583
--Give me those.
--Sure.

163
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,541
Here goes, Jonathan!

164
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,125
Here! Here! Here!

165
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
There you go Jonathan,
you got it!

166
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,041
Marion's amazing!

167
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,541
Their timing's perfect.

168
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,875
You can see they spend
all their time together.

169
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,083
So Sora just wasn't good enough
to be Jonathan's partner, huh!

170
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,291
On days when I don't have to
attend director's meetings,

171
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,333
I can take turns
juggling with Sora.

172
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,250
Then why don't you ask
Marion to take your place?

173
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh, that's an excellent idea.

174
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,750
That's right!

175
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,291
If someone the same age
as the kids is on stage,

176
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,666
I'm sure they'll end up
enjoying the show more.

177
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,791
I'm gonna do it. I will.

178
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,416
It's decided. Sora,
you switch to trampoline.

179
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,666
I'll do my best.

180
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,458
Jonathan is a really
quick learner, Dad.

181
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,791
He picked up using
a ball just like that,

182
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,416
and now he's learned how to
turn a ring with his nose.

183
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
Really?

184
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,166
But if we end up having a big
audience, he may get nervous.

185
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
Oh, but don't have
to worry about me.

186
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,625
I've always been fairly
strong under pressure.

187
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,833
So you're happy about
being on stage, huh, Marion?

188
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,958
That's not how it is at all.

189
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,583
Jonathan says that
the only person

190
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,583
who can be his partner is me.

191
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,291
I have to do it.

192
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,666
I see...

193
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,458
Here I go, Jonathan!

194
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,875
Here!

195
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,750
Here! Here!

196
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,791
Ah!

197
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,708
You'll pay for this!

198
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,375
Jonathan, wait!

199
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,708
Okay, I'm coming for you!

200
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,166
Well, do you give up now?

201
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm so happy we're going
to be my partners, Sora.

202
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,791
Pa-Partners? Well...

203
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,250
Marion's on the trampoline...

204
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,625
A few years ago,

205
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,541
her mother was the star
of our trampoline act.

206
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,708
So she really knows a lot
about performing on it.

207
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,250
And people thought
she would follow

208
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,583
in her mother's footsteps and
become a Kaleido Star, too.

209
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,791
But after her mother died,
she just quit the trampoline.

210
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,250
Marion!

211
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,583
This is the first time I've
seen you on the trampoline,

212
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,875
and you were amazing!

213
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,458
Like mother, like daughter.

214
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
What do you mean?
I was just playing around.

215
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,125
Please don't tell my dad.

216
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,583
OK we'll practice
it again, Jonathan.

217
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,000
Right after school.

218
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,791
Marion was doing the trampoline?

219
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,958
Yes.

220
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,291
Her performance is
so free and beautiful.

221
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,375
If she keeps practicing at it,
I bet she'll get even better.

222
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,750
It shouldn't be surprising.

223
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,125
Marion's mother was
a top trampoline star,

224
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,333
and Marion must have learnt it

225
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,416
by watching what her
mother did in practice.

226
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,250
Why, people used to
say all the time,

227
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,083
"Those two will be mother and
daughter Kaleido Stars"...

228
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,958
Oh, wow...

229
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,791
I wonder why she
quit the trampoline.

230
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
Maybe it's because the
trampoline reminds her

231
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,958
of her mom and
that makes her sad.

232
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,500
She may be afraid of
getting hurt while jumping.

233
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,333
Yeah, maybe...

234
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,541
But when I saw her jumping,

235
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,291
Marion looked like
she was having fun.

236
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,833
That's what I thought, too.

237
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,416
And why did she ask us
not to tell her dad?

238
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,208
So she wants to keep it
a secret from Jean?

239
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:30,958
Marion!

240
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,208
Why did you tell my dad?

241
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,708
Why did you tell him? I asked
you not to tell my dad, Sora.

242
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,833
Marion, did you jump
on the trampoline today?

243
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,125
Huh?

244
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,958
Now tell me the truth, Marion...

245
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,416
No, I didn't.

246
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,625
No, I didn't jump!

247
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,000
Jean knew?

248
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,125
Is it possible he overheard
our conversation?

249
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,416
Sorry...

250
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,125
I don't ever want to see my Dad

251
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,291
with that look
on his face again.

252
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,375
What?

253
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,791
I can't stand to see
my Dad look so sad!

254
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,208
And if I were to get hurt
doing the trampoline,

255
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,541
I'm sure it would
break his heart.

256
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,625
That's the reason why I don't
do the trampoline anymore.

257
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,791
I gave it up for my Dad.

258
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
So that's why.

259
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,041
Marion, I'm sorry for not
understanding how you feel.

260
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,083
Still, though...

261
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,708
I'm gonna do it. I will.

262
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,583
I mean... are you really sure?

263
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,583
Because I thought you wanted to
grow up to be like your mom.

264
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,875
Why do you say
things like that?!

265
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,166
Oh, Marion!

266
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,750
What's with her?

267
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
It's almost time for places.

268
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,791
Marion really loves
the trampoline,

269
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,333
but she's afraid
of hurting her Dad.

270
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,625
I wonder if there's anything
I can do to help her out.

271
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,291
Sagittarius is sinking
further and further

272
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,291
into the darkness
of uncertainty.

273
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,125
The key to getting
out of the darkness

274
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,291
is to be found
in Aquarius' girl.

275
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,291
Hey, Marion.

276
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,875
About this afternoon...

277
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,125
If you're talking about me doing
the trampoline, don't worry.

278
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,875
I have no interest
at all in doing it.

279
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,791
Um, Marion, do you remember
the shows Mom used to do?

280
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,250
She was so pretty.

281
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
She looked like a bird
flying free in the sky.

282
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,833
I especially loved the
way your Mom went about

283
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,541
performing on the trampoline.

284
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,000
Daddy...

285
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,791
I have something I've been
wanting to show you, Marion.

286
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,500
Huh?

287
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,500
Hmm?

288
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,583
Here, take a look at this.

289
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,958
What's this?

290
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,125
Daddy... this is...

291
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,166
Your mom's stage notebook.

292
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,166
I'm sorry for
hiding it from you.

293
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,583
I thought seeing it
would make you sad.

294
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,375
This was Mom's.

295
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,000
Your Mom was always trying
to come up with new acts,

296
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,833
and she would jot down
her ideas in this notebook.

297
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,958
Then she would practice
them over and over again

298
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,416
until she could
do them perfectly.

299
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,458
"Marion's Debut Stage"...

300
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,000
That's right.

301
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,500
Your mom would come up with
all of the performance ideas,

302
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,708
and then I would come up
with all of stage ideas.

303
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,791
I remember we talked
about it daily,

304
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:36,083
and every once in a while,
we'd even argue.

305
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,833
Your mom wanted to
appear on the stage

306
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,666
and do the trampoline
with you one day.

307
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,166
That was your mom's dream.

308
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,416
Mama... that's also my dream...

309
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,833
I've always wanted to appear
on the stage with you,

310
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,625
and together,
do the trampoline...

311
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,875
Marion...

312
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,958
Marion, when I found out

313
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,708
you were practicing your
routines on the trampoline,

314
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,791
I was really happy.

315
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,333
And you know what,

316
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,708
I'm pretty sure your Mom would
feel the same way as I do.

317
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,416
Would she really?

318
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,166
Yeah.

319
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,458
You like the trampoline,
don't you Marion?

320
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,791
Then for your mom's sake,

321
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,708
I want you to become
even better at it.

322
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,333
Really?

323
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,791
Wow, this is amazing.

324
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,458
Yeah, it looks fun.

325
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,458
It's also the perfect kind
of act for the Kids' Stage!

326
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,916
Then why don't we
add it in the show?

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, I think that's a really
good idea. Way to go, Marion.

328
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,250
If I might ask,

329
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,083
what are we going to do
about Cynthia's role?

330
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,958
Oh... I don't know...

331
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,125
Sora, will you do it for me?

332
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,166
Yeah!

333
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,375
--Are you sure?
--You don't want to?

334
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,791
No, That's not it.
It was your mom's role.

335
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,208
Yep. I want you to do it.

336
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,750
In that case, my answer is yes!

337
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,958
Yaay!

338
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,625
Wow, things are
getting exciting!

339
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,708
Does this mean I'm going
to be Jonathan's partner?

340
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,666
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

341
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,208
Jonathan, let's do our best.

342
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,958
They laughed...

343
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,375
Okay, Jonathan,
say hello to everyone!

344
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,666
Ready? Go!

345
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,375
That looks good on you, Marion.

346
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,750
This is the place
where my mom was.

347
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,125
Ready? Jump!

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,458
Oh...

349
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,458
Jump!

350
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,375
Why is it, when people
perform with Sora,

351
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,416
they always end up smiling?

352
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,833
Marion.

353
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,333
They went against my expressed
wishes to create this?

354
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,625
How frivolous.

355
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,250
Wait, Leon.

356
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:34,958
Look, everyone is smiling!
This is the real Kaleido Stage.

357
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,250
Maybe this is the Kaleido
Stage I'm aiming for.

358
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,375
Maybe! Maybe!

359
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,041
I can see why they call
him the lord of darkness.

360
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,666
So this is the circus festival

361
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,708
that's held once
every three years!

362
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,625
Miss Layla won the last festival
by doing the Golden Phoenix.

363
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,708
My partner is Leon,
lord of darkness.

364
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,416
Then, tragedy strikes May.

365
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,916
Just watch, I will
definitely be a contestant!

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,625
I will! I will!

367
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,166
Next time on Kaleido Star,
"Amazing Training With Leon."

368
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,333
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
