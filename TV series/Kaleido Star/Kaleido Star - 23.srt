1
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,083
Everybody, Kaleido Star
is about to start!

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,458
You're gonna want to make sure
that your room is brightly lit

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,708
and that you're not sitting
too close to the TV.

4
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,000
Is everyone ready?

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,041
Yep!

6
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,500
Well, well, well.

7
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,541
Have you ever been really
determined to do something?

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,458
I mean, so determined that you
won't let anyone or anything

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,833
sway you from your goal?

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,500
I've tried lots
of things in my life,

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,166
and I've always done my best,

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,333
but now it looks like I'll be
facing my biggest challenge yet.

13
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,875
It kinda scares me,

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,291
but there's no way I'm gonna
back down now! No way! No way!

15
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,958
What's this...

16
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,250
This?!

17
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,625
Can you see me now, Layla?

18
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,291
'The Legendary
Amazing Maneuver.'

19
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:50,166
Where are we-- Sora!
What's gotten into you?

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,958
You saw him! You're able
to see the Fool now too!

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,500
Well I saw something...

22
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,166
That's right, the Fool.

23
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,625
He has a name?

24
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,833
What Sora neglected to mention
is I'm the spirit of the stage.

25
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:13,083
Amazing. I wasn't that calm
when I saw him the first time.

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,875
Oh, baby, that tickles.

27
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,125
Well, I'm glad that
you can see him too,

28
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,125
then I'm not just
losing my mind here.

29
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,375
Believe me, if anybody's
insane it's him.

30
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,958
Hey!

31
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,166
But Layla does this mean you
couldn't see him before today?

32
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,541
Layla has always been a capable
performer in the past...

33
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,000
But today you've proven
to be more than that,

34
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,583
and now you're worthy
of all my secrets.

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,625
What kind of secrets?

36
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,000
The Legendary Great Maneuver.
No one's attempted it in years

37
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:48,333
and the last person who did paid
for the privilege with his life.

38
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,791
But he was not the first to
fall. Many tried before him,

39
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,416
and many failed.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,083
If you ladies try this,

41
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,958
you will only be the second team
from Kaleido Stage to do so.

42
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,083
The second?

43
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:06,166
Yes. It is very rare that I
find two stars capable of it.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,416
What happened to the other
team from Kaleido Stage?

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,791
They died.

46
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,333
It turns out one of the partners
couldn't see me at all.

47
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,041
He just pretended to.

48
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,791
So I was tricked into
revealing my secret.

49
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:27,458
But Layla really can see you!
And I've seen you for ages.

50
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,875
So that means you're going to
tell us how to do it, right?

51
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,500
Not right now.
That would be a mistake.

52
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,791
I'll reveal the maneuver to you

53
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,833
when you're
qualified to perform it.

54
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,375
Qualified?

55
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,708
How can we prepare if we don't
know what we're aiming for?

56
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,208
You'll have to figure
that out on your own.

57
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,916
In the meantime,
I think I've said enough.

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,750
Don't be mean! C'mon, tell us!

59
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,791
Sora, if you were to try
that maneuver now...

60
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,250
The Death card.

61
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,541
Surely one of you
would die. Maybe both.

62
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,416
But I know... I know
I could do it with you...

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,333
that we could do it together!

64
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,375
I'm going to have
to think about this.

65
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:36,958
But Layla, I promise I'll
try my best! I promise...

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,750
She doesn't think
I'm good enough.

67
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,208
It looks like Layla's gonna
be a part of the troupe now.

68
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Yes.

69
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,791
So if she leaves London
first thing in the morning,

70
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,333
she can be here by noon.

71
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,625
I mean, with the time
difference and all.

72
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,666
I've gotta do it-- I've gotta
convince her somehow to try

73
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,333
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

74
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,083
The legendary what now?

75
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,833
What's that, Sora?

76
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know. But now that
Layla's my gonna be my partner,

77
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:11,625
I know that whatever it is we
can do it if we both want to.

78
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,708
I just have to convince her...

79
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,500
Come one, come all to the
brand-new Kaleido Stage!

80
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,083
You won't want to miss the
amazing special effects!

81
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,750
Come on, step right up
ladies and gents!

82
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,958
Hey, Julie, did you hear? The
masked star was Layla after all.

83
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,166
Man, I wish I was
in that company.

84
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,833
I know. I'm starting to think
I'd rather be a bit player

85
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,583
in Layla's show
than a star here.

86
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,500
But I guess you don't
have that choice.

87
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,125
Neither do I, for that matter.

88
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,708
I bet if Layla was here

89
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,166
our audiences wouldn't just keep
getting smaller and smaller--

90
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,875
If you don't
like it you can leave.

91
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,625
You're released
from your duties.

92
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,375
But we-- We got fired!

93
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,083
I think it's for the best.

94
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,583
It's Yuri.

95
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,291
Did you hear? Kaleido Stage
is about to go under...

96
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:13,708
I'm glad you agreed to meet me.
How did the rest of filming go?

97
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,708
It went very well thank you.

98
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,708
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

99
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,666
Is that why you asked me here?

100
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,625
I want you to come back Layla.

101
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,791
Kaleido Stage just isn't
the same without you there.

102
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,333
I want us to perform
as partners again.

103
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,333
I already have a
partner, Yuri. It's Sora.

104
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,416
The two of us have even been
talking about attempting

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,416
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

106
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,750
That's crazy. You can't
do that with Sora.

107
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,333
She's a beginner for
God's sake! You can't do this!

108
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,791
I've decided.

109
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,458
Well, if you're gonna do it,
you should do it with me!

110
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,000
You are not qualified.

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,833
I see. 

112
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,041
When I saw Kaleido Stage

113
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,458
for the first time it was like
some kind of wonderful dream.

114
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,666
I wished I was part
of the show, too.

115
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
About a year after my
parents died I started

116
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,875
taking gymnastic classes.

117
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,791
It was fun for me,
and I was good at it.

118
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,500
That was the first time
I got applause.

119
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,166
I remember just starting out,

120
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
working on this
difficult maneuver.

121
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,000
And when I perfected it,
the applause made me tremble.

122
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,750
It was such an amazing
feeling to be on stage for

123
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,750
the first time and
to hear people cheering.

124
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,208
That's why I push
myself to be the best.

125
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,000
That's why I always want more.

126
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,583
I wanna show them.

127
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,500
I want them to see it.

128
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,958
That's why we've got to try. We
can do this Layla, I know it!

129
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,291
The Legendary Great Maneuver?

130
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,708
I'm sure Kalos would
know something about it.

131
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,458
Or at least about the
people who've attempted

132
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,750
the maneuver before.

133
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,333
I see. But he might not
want to discuss it.

134
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,583
It's been years since he's said
anything about that routine.

135
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,916
Even if Sora and I
want to give it a try?

136
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,833
I suppose he'll want to
tell you everything he can.

137
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,083
I'll give you his
contact information.

138
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,625
Oh no! I just had
my back turned for a second.

139
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,625
Master, would you mind
showing me that again?

140
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,375
Could you wait for
a moment, Layla?

141
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,458
Sure.

142
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,958
You never stop training,
do you, Sora?

143
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,208
I can't afford to take any
time off. Not if I want to be

144
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,041
good enough to
perform with Layla.

145
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,833
Sora, is this true?

146
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,375
What?

147
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,875
'Layla Hamilton and Sora Naegino
will return to Kaleido Stage

148
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,083
for one night only to attempt
a deadly trick known only as

149
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,333
the "Legendary Great Maneuver."'

150
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,291
Really?

151
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,000
The show's next month.

152
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,208
Oh no.

153
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,291
Can I help you with something?

154
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,083
Yes, there was an announcement
in the news today about

155
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,375
the Legendary Great Maneuver?

156
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,583
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
That show's already sold out.

157
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,208
What?!

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,250
Hey, you can't go back there.

159
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm one of the
performers in that show!

160
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,750
Huh?

161
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,250
Good morning, Sora.

162
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,458
Yuri.

163
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,416
Well, your little show
sold out in minutes.

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,416
But if you want some comps
for your friends and family,

165
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,416
I'm sure we could arrange
something for you and Layla--

166
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
But how did you know
we were going to try this?

167
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,458
I heard it from Layla.

168
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,208
Do you mean that Layla
told you she wanted to try

169
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,416
the Legendary Great Maneuver?

170
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,541
But Yuri made the announcement
without consulting us.

171
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,625
So, what? You're trying
to humiliate us?

172
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,625
On the contrary, I'm paying
you both a great compliment.

173
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,750
Not everyone is qualified
to perform this maneuver.

174
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,166
It's just my luck there are
two qualified performers

175
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,333
who want to attempt it.

176
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,291
But if you two are getting
cold feet we might as well

177
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,625
cancel the show right now.

178
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,875
It's too bad the tickets
aren't refundable.

179
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,250
But you--

180
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,208
We're not going to cancel.

181
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,375
And I think we should make
the stakes a little higher.

182
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,541
What do you mean?

183
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,000
If we successfully
perform the maneuver,

184
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,875
you will return
Kaleido Stage to Kalos.

185
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,375
It's a deal. So you've got
exactly one month to perform

186
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,041
this Legendary Great Maneuver.

187
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,458
Layla?

188
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,000
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

189
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,541
Sora I know we can do this.

190
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,125
No matter what happens, we've
got to be at that performance

191
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,541
and we've got to win.

192
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,666
We will work on this stage again

193
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,375
and it's not going
to be for just one night.

194
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,666
Right. But Layla, how can
we prepare for this if

195
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,125
we don't even know
what we'll be doing?

196
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,333
Kalos will tell us
what we need to do.

197
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,791
He's helping?

198
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,916
I think he's the
only one who can.

199
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,791
He told me he remembers how the
last group from Kaleido Stage

200
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,291
prepared for this. We can
meet him at the Grand Canyon.

201
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,750
That is, if you want to Sora.

202
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,250
Of course I do.

203
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,041
And he really said he'd
give Kaleido Stage back?

204
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,166
Yes, as long as Layla and I
can do the maneuver perfectly.

205
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,250
We're gonna do our best to get
Kaleido Stage back for everyone!

206
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,875
And the Boss is gonna coach you?

207
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,708
We know you can do it, Sora.

208
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,875
Me and Jonathan
believe in you, too.

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,750
We're gonna be there
to cheer you on.

210
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,125
I bought tickets as soon as I
heard you'd be on stage, Sora.

211
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm going with you.

212
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,416
What?

213
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,833
Kalos is going to work you
to the bone out there.

214
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,708
You'll need a trainer, Sora.

215
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,125
Ken.

216
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,750
Hey, I wanna go, too!

217
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,458
And so do I!

218
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,625
Why don't we all go together?

219
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,291
But that's impossible...

220
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,208
So the Boss is going to
tell us how to train for

221
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,291
the Legendary Great Maneuver.

222
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,958
Just keep in mind, if you
find out what the trick is

223
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,250
before you're
prepared to do it--

224
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,583
I know, I know.
I already saw the Death card.

225
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,666
Hey, we came along
to help you train.

226
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,333
Aren't you a lucky girl?

227
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,208
Uh. I guess so...

228
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,875
Sora. I came along because

229
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,833
I support your decision
to do this. But if--

230
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,708
If I ever think you're in real
danger I'm going to make you

231
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,291
give up on this. I think you
should know that up front.

232
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,458
Ken.

233
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,291
I don't want to
risk losing you, Sora.

234
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,750
It's been a while, huh? Welcome.

235
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,791
Hi, Boss.

236
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,541
Let's get to work.

237
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,208
I have a really bad
feeling about this...

238
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:48,916
What?

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,208
I've e-mailed everyone

240
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,750
I can find that used
to work at Kaleido Stage,

241
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,625
asking about the Legendary
Great Maneuver, you know.

242
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,000
I found out that the last
time anyone tried to do it

243
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,250
was ten years ago...

244
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,125
And what happened?

245
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,833
Both of them died.

246
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,875
I wonder who they were...

247
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,958
I've found another
recipe for you to try.

248
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:24,375
Let me know what you think
of this one first. Well?

249
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,875
That's really disgusting.

250
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,125
Then why don't you do
the cooking from now on?

251
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,083
'Cause I'm not
very good at this stuff.

252
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,416
Next, you'll do a hundred
one-armed chin-ups.

253
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,750
No resting!

254
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,375
Sora?

255
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,875
Now jump.

256
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh no. Help!

257
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:01,000
Help!

258
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,041
That's it for today's training.

259
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,541
Not yet. Sora, I need you
to do a hundred curls

260
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,208
with your right hand.

261
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,791
You ready?

262
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,291
Yes.

263
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,291
I can cut that
for you if you want.

264
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:33,500
Thank you, Ken. I'll be okay.
I've gotta get used to this.

265
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,333
Yeah, you're right.

266
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,750
But-- that's impossible.
That maneuver can't be done.

267
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,916
He said that
in order to perfect it,

268
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,625
all someone would need
is absolute confidence.

269
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:54,958
Who said that?

270
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,500
But that doesn't just
apply to the two of them.

271
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,958
It applies to
everyone around them.

272
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,208
If you want Sora
and Layla to succeed,

273
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,250
you can never let them know
you have that any doubts.

274
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,791
You'll have to be relentless.

275
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,916
You can never let them stint
on their training. Never

276
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,625
If you can't do that,
you'd better leave right now.

277
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:20,083
But if you stay, you won't
tell Sora about the maneuver.

278
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,750
It hurts but you'll have to bear
it. If I don't loosen you up

279
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,958
you won't be able to train.
Tomorrow's gonna be

280
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,708
a lighter day than today,
but after that we're gonna--

281
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,791
Ken?

282
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:42,208
Do you-- do you really
think that I can do this?

283
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,625
I mean, if the
training's this hard,

284
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,500
how will I ever get through it?

285
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,500
Now she's doubting herself?

286
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,041
Good.

287
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,083
We've been doing
the same program

288
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,458
for more than a week now.

289
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:18,250
Don't complain.
Just do what Kalos says.

290
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,458
Ken, you you sound like
a different person.

291
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,916
And so do you, Sora.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,291
Weren't you the one
who wanted to try

293
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,791
the Legendary Great Maneuver
in the first place?

294
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,666
I-- yes.

295
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,458
Layla, you've completed the
first level. You'll start

296
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,708
training on the ropes first
thing tomorrow morning.

297
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:37,958
Good.

298
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,083
Sora. Come here.

299
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,416
Sir.

300
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,125
The iron ball hanging

301
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,833
from this wire weighs
about as much as Layla.

302
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,458
What you have to do is catch
the ball with your right hand

303
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,208
and push it back to me.

304
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,500
If you can't do this,
you can't be Layla's partner.

305
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,833
Got it, Sora?

306
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,958
Yes. I'm ready, Boss!

307
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,041
If you want Sora
and Layla to succeed,

308
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,000
you can never let them
know you have any doubts.

309
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,541
Kalos, wait a minute!

310
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,791
What, Ken?

311
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,041
I would like to handle

312
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,333
this part of her training
if you don't mind.

313
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,416
You would?

314
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,625
Are you sure that
you're up to it?

315
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,208
I am.

316
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,208
Are you ready Sora?

317
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,833
Let's go.

318
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Come on.

319
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,875
Sora. Stand up.

320
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,166
I'm ready.

321
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,708
Again!

322
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,000
I...I've gotta catch
that ball no matter what.

323
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,041
I've got to do the
Legendary Great Maneuver!

324
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,250
Stand up, Sora.

325
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,625
Resting's not gonna help.

326
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,458
I want you to stop this
thing before dinnertime.

327
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,458
I wish I knew what
I'm trying to achieve...

328
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,416
I wonder how long I can
keep going like this?

329
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,916
I just wish I knew what
all this is for. Fool?

330
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,583
Fool, where are you?

331
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,791
Will you tell me now?

332
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,041
Not yet.

333
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:17,916
But, Fool...

334
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
I told you before:

335
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,083
I'll let you know what the
maneuver entails only when

336
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,333
you're ready to perform it,
not a moment sooner.

337
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,750
So I'm still not good enough?
Not yet, not yet...

338
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,500
Can you even say you deserve

339
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,625
to be a partner to
the great Layla Hamilton?

340
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,458
I'm training harder than
ever before, but still--

341
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,375
This is ridiculous!

342
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,041
She's going to destroy herself!

343
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,833
I've got to keep training. I
don't want to give up, but...

344
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,291
Every day I feel like
crying or running away.

345
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,541
Layla, please say something
to me! Please! Please!

346
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,291
Don't miss the
next Kaleido Star,

347
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,041
'The Amazing Intensive
Training Continues.'

348
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,708
My wings are my dream
and on towards the sky...
