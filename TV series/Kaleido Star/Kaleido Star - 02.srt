1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,125
Hey, everyone,
Kaleido Star is about to start,

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,625
so make sure your room
is brightly lit and that

3
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,416
you're not sitting
too close to the TV.

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,958
My name is Sora Naegino.
Ever since I was a little girl

5
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,583
it's been my dream to
perform with Kaleido Stage.

6
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,916
So a few months ago I came
to the U.S. to give it a shot.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,375
Boy, has it been an experience.
Everything is new to me,

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,250
and sometimes I'm little lost.
But that's not going to keep me

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,500
from doing my best.

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,166
There's nothing I can't
do if I try hard enough!

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,916
So, what would you do
if you were faced

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,458
with something super difficult?

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,666
When everybody around you said

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,625
there is no way
that you can do it.

15
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,166
But, in the end you just
gotta believe in yourself?

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,541
And change that that difficult
situation to an opportunity!

17
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,000
Change it! Change it!

18
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,583
A doll? A ghost? What is that?

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:50,166
You may call me Fool.
I am the sprit of the stage.

20
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,625
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.

21
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,916
I'm not hearing any weird
voice. Nothing is there.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,541
Nothing is there.

23
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,125
Oh, it's not there. Thank god.

24
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,708
What are you doing?

25
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,875
Listen, if you can see me,

26
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,250
it means that you
were chosen for the stage.

27
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,791
Oh no, it's still talking. 

28
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,041
What is your name?

29
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,750
Sora Naegino... Why am
I talking back to it?!

30
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
It seems that tonight
a new star will be born.

31
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,500
It's the dawning of a new era
for the Kaleido Stage!

32
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,291
I'm asking for
a different room!

33
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,208
Hey!

34
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,125
Hmph!

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,500
My Amazing and
Lonely Challenge!

36
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,208
Excuse me, Dorm Supervisor,
may I come in?

37
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,666
Could you please ....!

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,208
Attack!

39
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,875
...explain what I just saw.

40
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,166
What's this?!

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,875
I, um... I'm sorry!

42
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,666
Teach me that trick
you just did!

43
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,500
What this?

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,541
Yes. I want you to teach me
this trick right now!

45
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,041
Oh, I didn't know
you're a new student.

46
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Yes. My name is Sora Naegino.

47
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,208
Well, sorry, for what
I did out in the hall.

48
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,583
But you should never

49
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,375
open the door in the middle
of my karate practice.

50
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,666
Sorry, Dorm Supervisor,
but I uh...

51
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,375
By the way I'm Sarah, haha!

52
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:37,000
Sarah?... Sarah diva
of Kaleido Stage?

53
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,708
That's right.

54
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:43,083
So, this is the gorgeous Sarah,
I've heard so much about...

55
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,833
I can't believe it!

56
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,375
Hey, you are Japanese,
aren't you?

57
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,000
uh... um, yes.

58
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,208
I'm into Karate at the moment.
Can you be my sparring partner?

59
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,416
Everyone in Japan has
a Black Belt, right?

60
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,750
Oh, and teach me
that trick you just did, too.

61
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,791
And then...
you love Sushi right...?

62
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,750
Uh... I never knew Miss
Sarah was so, well...unique.

63
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,333
All that and I didn't
even get to change my room.

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,875
That's her, right?

65
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,208
The one who got in good with
the Boss and cheated her way in?

66
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,125
She was late for the
audition and still passed.

67
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,916
That makes me so mad.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,458
She got in good with
the Boss to join the troupe?

69
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,791
I heard she's even sweet talked
her way onto the stage already.

70
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,416
That is unforgivable.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,750
I had to try three times

72
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,708
before I got accepted
to the Kaleido Stage.

73
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,833
The third time's the charm, huh?

74
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,916
No.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,875
Uh, I mean...

76
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,000
You mean?

77
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,333
I mean.. um,
"Better late than never?"

78
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,041
Yeah, thanks.

79
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,083
Shoot. I screwed up again.

80
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's just forget it!

81
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,291
Not here. Looks like
it was just my imagination.

82
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,958
How weird...I guess I'm
more tired than I thought.

83
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,166
When you're tired,

84
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,083
you should take a shower
and go to bed early.

85
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,958
You're right.
I think I'll do that.

86
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,291
Take a shower and... huuuh?

87
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,166
Sora, go relax.
You're so uptight.

88
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,541
After all, it's been
a long day for you right?

89
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,708
Go now, Sora, into the shower.

90
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,666
Hum? See you look pale.

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,833
Go relax and then slumber
until the late morning hour.

92
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,333
Oh, he is still here.

93
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,250
How dare you treat the spirit
of the stage this way?!

94
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,000
I demand you to untie
this rope, right now.

95
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,458
Can you at least take off
this blindfold, please.

96
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,541
It's rather early
for that kind of work.

97
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,041
Oh, uh, Hello!

98
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,458
Newcomers don't usually clean
the place when they first start.

99
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,500
It's just I woke up
so early and...

100
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,333
Oh, I wanted to thank you
for allowing me to join

101
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,041
the Kaleido Stage.
Thank you very much.

102
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,291
Hum? Is something wrong?

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,041
You're a little on the
short side, but I think

104
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,583
you'll work out.

105
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,250
Oh, well that's nice.

106
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,500
Oh, good morning!

107
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,750
My, aren't we up bright
and early this morning?

108
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,583
Yeah, if you like
cleaning that much,

109
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,208
you can go ahead and all of
do ours while you're at it.

110
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,583
What?

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,291
Some of us really need
to get to our lesson early.

112
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,625
Oh yeah, I'm really talented,

113
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,291
but since I'm not close
to Kalos, the only way I can

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:53,416
appear on the stage is
by actually working hard.

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,458
So, you can take care of
the rest of cleaning for us.

116
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,291
Yeah, I feel better now.

117
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,458
That's all right.

118
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:08,500
I'll clean this myself. Aaah!

119
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,083
Just what you'd expect
from Kaleido Stage,

120
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,083
-- bigger than it looks.

121
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:13,916
Sora!

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,333
Huh? Ken.

123
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,708
Hey. You look tired.
What's going on?

124
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,291
It's just I didn't realize

125
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,666
it was too big of
a job for one person.

126
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,791
What! Did you clean
the stage by yourself?

127
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,083
Oh... No...
I meant I'm a slowpoke,

128
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,250
so it took me longer
than everyone else.

129
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,875
By the way,
if you don't hurry,

130
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,166
you will be late
for your lessons.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,458
Oh, no. See you later!

132
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:42,166
Good luck, Sora. You still
have long road ahead of you.

133
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,708
Everyone,
please listen carefully!

134
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,041
In these ballet lessons,
I want you to master

135
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,625
how to move your body
beautifully which is essential

136
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,375
for performing
the grand ceremony.

137
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,375
A beautiful body movement,
is one that is...

138
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,291
Excuse me
I'm so sorry, I'm late!

139
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,208
Hum? What are you doing?!

140
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,333
Sorry, I'm late.
I was cleaning the stage.

141
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,416
Really... And weren't
you also late for the audition

142
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,583
the other day?

143
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,333
I apologize. I'll
try harder in future.

144
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,791
All right, fine. Now, we're
going to start today's lesson.

145
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,875
OK, everyone,
one row at a time, TURN!

146
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,500
I have to work harder.

147
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,375
Next!

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,750
Excuse me, you!

149
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, yes.

150
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,166
Don't you have any
ballet experience at all?

151
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,666
Uh... no.

152
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,666
Oh, dear. That just
will not do, at all!

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,000
You see, in order to present
a beautiful pose on the stage,

154
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,458
the knowledge of ballet
is absolutely essential.

155
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,708
E-sential!
That's all right.

156
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,041
OK people, I must
think... must think!

157
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,375
How did someone
like her ever get in?

158
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,291
It's so unfair!

159
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,125
Mm-hm.

160
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,416
She gets to make them laugh.

161
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,458
Oh... You're unbelievable...

162
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,583
I can't believe
you were on stage

163
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,041
when you couldn't do something
as easy as that turn.

164
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,375
Hmm?

165
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,541
Poor Sora. Can't make
a simple turn, but she'll

166
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,666
still get to go on stage.

167
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,916
It must be nice.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,208
That's right...
Right now, I can't even make

169
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,291
a simple turn, but one day,
one day I will do great turns.

170
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,833
And someday,
I'll do amazing routines,

171
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,208
just like Layla does....

172
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,416
Uh, Just like Layla...
the Golden Phoenix?

173
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,041
Ha, you're kidding; you think
the Golden Phoenix is that easy?

174
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,208
You think it's a piece of cake?

175
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,041
Well... I didn't mean like that.

176
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,875
Go ahead then... Why don't
show us your Golden Phoenix?

177
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,166
Oh... no... well...

178
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,458
Doing the Golden Phoenix
must be a piece of cake for you

179
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,583
since Kalos has such great
confidence in your abilities.

180
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
I just meant...

181
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,208
What's wrong?
Can't you do that?

182
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,416
I'll let you know that I don't
acknowledge that you are here.

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,291
You don't belong on the stage.

184
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,541
All right then. I will do it!

185
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,083
I will show you that
I can do the Golden Phoenix!

186
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,208
Really? I will
look forward to it.

187
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,041
Then, be ready
to show it to me in a week.

188
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,833
But, if you can't do it
after claiming so boldly

189
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,541
that you could, I will ask
you to leave here immediately.

190
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,125
Fine.

191
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,666
Yuri, let's go
to the training room.

192
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,166
It isn't like you

193
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,958
to say something
like that to a newcomer.

194
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,166
I just can't stand that
Kalus would let someone

195
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,166
on Kaleido Stage who
cannot do anything.

196
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,458
The Golden Phoenix?!

197
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,083
I'd like to borrow a video
of Miss Layla if you have it.

198
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,791
That is totally reckless!

199
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,041
The Golden Phoenix is
a trick that only Miss Layla,

200
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,500
the top star is
capable of doing!

201
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,833
I know.

202
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,500
And it's a maneuver
that is done on the swings.

203
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,208
Sora, have you ever
worked on swings before?

204
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,750
No, but I've got no choice,
I have to do it!

205
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,625
I want everyone to accept me.

206
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,500
And for that, I have no choice,
but do the Golden Phoenix!

207
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,166
Sora...

208
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,791
The Golden Phoenix
is a trick that you

209
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,541
swing the swings widely,

210
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,791
and spin your body
with a high speed.

211
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,041
Then release the bar

212
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,208
and fly towards your
partner like a phoenix

213
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,291
with your arms wide open
and catch your partner's bar.

214
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,541
The spinning of your body

215
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,000
using this special bar
is extremely difficult.

216
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,291
Layla and Yuri are
using the training room

217
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,750
for their new routine.
So, you have to use

218
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,833
the actual swings on the stage.

219
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,416
It has a net, but it's
still pretty dangerous

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,750
since we're so high up.

221
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,500
I'll be all right.
So, what I need to do?

222
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,083
Well... First, you need to
practice to sway your body

223
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,416
side and side.

224
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,166
Then, you will jump to
the bar on the other side

225
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,125
after you gain enough momentum.

226
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,916
Are you okay?

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,416
Yeah, I'm fine.

228
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,125
If you fall, make sure you
land on your back. All right?

229
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,791
You don't have enough
momentum! Just let go! Whew.

230
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,791
I never knew just
swinging was this hard.

231
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,250
But, I will do it
no matter what!

232
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm sorry that I ended up
keeping you here until morning.

233
00:13:56,166 --> 00:14:01,416
Oh, don't worry about it.
If it's for you, I don't...

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Sora!

235
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,916
Mr. Policeman!

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,541
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

237
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,375
I was practicing the swings.

238
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:14,583
I see, well good luck. Tell me
when you will be on stage, okay?

239
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,083
I am your fan No.1, you got it?

240
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,166
Oh, thank you, very much.

241
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,958
Hm? Hmm. 

242
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,958
H- Hi...

243
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,125
I'll test you
to see if you're a man

244
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,958
worthy of being
Sora's boyfriend or not!

245
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,166
You got it all wrong!

246
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,666
He is not my boyfriend; he's
not anything at all... !

247
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,958
You sure?

248
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
No, Not at all...

249
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,375
Good luck Sora!

250
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,666
Not anything at all like that...
Not anything at all like that...

251
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,500
I really better
work hard though...

252
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,000
Or I'll end up
having to leave this place

253
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,333
before I ever get on
the Kaleido stage.

254
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,708
Ken... meet me later
tonight, too, okay?

255
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,250
Of course.

256
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,041
Oh...

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,666
Were you practicing
all this time?

258
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,875
Yes, because if I don't
work hard at it...

259
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,875
It's not something you can do,
just by working hard at it.

260
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,458
Why don't you give up
and apologize to Layla?

261
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,750
No, I'm not giving up.
I gave up once on joining

262
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,875
Kaleido Stage because
I missed the audition.

263
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,750
But, somehow I managed to get
in. So, I want to stay here!

264
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,791
I don't ever want
to give up on it again!

265
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,625
Ow...

266
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,250
If you think that's painful, the
road will be a long one for you.

267
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,958
Oh... He is still here.

268
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,041
The upside down "Chariot."

269
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,583
This card indicates that
things will end in failure

270
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,083
and that you will taste defeat.

271
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,125
Sora, the results of a
fortune telling may be bad,

272
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,583
but the future
can be changed...

273
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,500
Huh?

274
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:10,083
...but it depends
on that person's efforts.

275
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,708
In order to have muscle
strength to be able to perform

276
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,750
these kinds of acrobatics,
you have to eat low fat

277
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,750
and high protein foods.

278
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,500
Check her out...

279
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,666
She really must
be working hard..

280
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,583
I did it!

281
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,333
Okay, Sora. Next, you have to
do it while you're spinning.

282
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,541
Sora!

283
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,333
Huh?

284
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,416
We brought you something!

285
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,791
We know you haven't
eaten anything.

286
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh...

287
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,583
How do you like it?

288
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,208
It's really good.

289
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,333
You need the protein;
eat it all, okay?

290
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,500
Mmm-hm

291
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,666
And I recommend you try this.

292
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,666
Hot Pepper drink?

293
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,250
It will give you energy.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,791
Anna, Mia, thank you.

295
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,291
Sorry, Sora. I should have
never mentioned something

296
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,916
like the Golden
Phoenix to you...

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,291
Don't worry about that.

298
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,750
Now I have the chance
to prove myself around here.

299
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,041
At first, I thought
you were accepted

300
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,875
because you got in good
with the Boss.

301
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,000
But I guess that wasn't
the really case.

302
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,708
Sorry for being hard on you.

303
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,041
It's okay-no big deal..

304
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, the Band-Aid on
your hand is coming loose.

305
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,833
Here, I'll fix it. for you.

306
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,333
Good luck.
We're rooting for you.

307
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,500
Thank you.

308
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:39,500
Swing the bar side to side,
and spin. Then jump.

309
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,333
Is Sora okay?

310
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,791
She is doing
visualization training.

311
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,833
She is picturing the image

312
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,958
of the perfected
routine in her head.

313
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,166
Hm.

314
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,750
And Finish.

315
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,875
Therefore... Well...
In other words...

316
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,041
I'm listening to the
lecture. So, just go on.....

317
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,666
Yes, Thank you ...

318
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,875
Oh, Yuri?!

319
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,166
Where on earth are you
looking when you jump?

320
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,958
Huh?

321
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,541
There is no Juliet who is not
always looking for her Romeo.

322
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,125
That's why you
cannot be Juliet.

323
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh... but... Yuri...
I am just trying

324
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,625
to get the golden phoenix;
I wasn't trying for Juliet.

325
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,208
Oh, that was
close wasn't it..

326
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,958
I can't believe
she's really doing it.

327
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,000
If only she could
grab that bar...

328
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,916
No, not yet. She still
can't keep a beautiful pose

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,291
in the air. Even before
she catches the bar,

330
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,291
what she is doing can't
be called the Golden Phoenix.

331
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,625
Go, Sora!

332
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:20,125
By tomorrow... It has to
be perfect it by tomorrow.

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,291
You couldn't perfect it after
all, but you did your best.

334
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,250
Who knows?
The real test is tomorrow.

335
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,333
I haven't given up
hope just yet.

336
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,666
So why have you given up Ken.

337
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,958
I cannot wait to see
what kind of Golden Phoenix

338
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,958
she is going to show us.

339
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,333
I know. 

340
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,375
Thank you all for coming.

341
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,375
I've got to do it.
Uhh. I must believe!

342
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,583
The one I need to aim for is
not the bar. My aim is my love,

343
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,166
My aim is Romeo.

344
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,541
And then, then I'll be Juliet.

345
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,625
The Golden Phoneix!

346
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,500
She did it!

347
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,666
Oh...

348
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,708
Oh!

349
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,250
Oh...

350
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,041
Sora, are you all right?

351
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,750
Yes. Thank you.

352
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,833
You're really something.

353
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,875
Oh... uh Layla.

354
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,500
You didn't get
the last part right,

355
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,416
but it was definitely
the Golden Phoenix.

356
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,041
Huh?!

357
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,750
You definitely deserve
credit for pulling it off.

358
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,166
Yuri, let's go.

359
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,833
Sora, you can stay here
at Kaleido Stage!

360
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,333
--Congratulations, Sora!
--I'm so glad for you, Sora!

361
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,250
Oh...

362
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,791
That so cool. 

363
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,750
I can stay at Kaleido Stage?

364
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,625
Cheers!

365
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,083
Aren't you happy that able
to stay at Kaleido Stage, Sora?

366
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,083
Yes, of course I am.

367
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,625
You're still here?!

368
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,166
Sora, I think you should
all fly a kite together;

369
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,541
they say real friendship begins
when you all fly a kite.

370
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,291
But thats just
my friends I suppose.

371
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,000
That's enough!

372
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Ouch! What are
you doing, Sora?!

373
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,916
Oh, well... This is... Um...

374
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,458
Well... Please stop it!

375
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,083
Hmm?

376
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,583
Oh... oops!

377
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,916
I know what this is...
This is that Japanese comedy

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,416
routine called "Tsukkomi" isn't
it? I've heard of this before.

379
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,125
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

380
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,916
Um...Hey, you guys
cannot really see him?

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,083
See who?

382
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,375
Oh...

383
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,541
What a party? Oh no,
no girls - not good.

384
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,791
Dorm Supervisor!

385
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,791
So, parties aren't allowed?

386
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,125
Of course, not...
unless you invite me .

387
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,791
Because those are
the rules at this dormitory.

388
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,083
Miss Sarah...

389
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,250
Miss Sarah?!

390
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,750
No way!

391
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,458
Now, let's have some fun!

392
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,708
Unbelievable!

393
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,666
You don't have a role.

394
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,416
Kaleido Stage's
next theme is Cinderella.

395
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,833
I heard that
all of the newcomer's

396
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,375
will participant in this.

397
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,000
But, I'm only one
who doesn't have a role?

398
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,041
It can't be.

399
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,708
It must be some
kind of mistake.

400
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,291
According to the roster Kalos,

401
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,000
my job as handing out toys to
children in the theater. Um...

402
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,875
I just make it here!
Gotta! Gotta!

403
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,625
Next Kaleido Star,
"The Amazing Distant Stage!"

404
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,583
My wings are my dreams
and on toward the sky...
