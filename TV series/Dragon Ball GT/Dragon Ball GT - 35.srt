[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,041
The tide turned when Goku
transformed into a giant ape,

3
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,291
obtaining startling
levels of power that

4
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,875
surpassed anything
ever achieved by Baby.

5
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,125
However, Goku could not handle
the enormous amount of power

6
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,750
pulsating through his body,

7
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,791
causing the violent animal
instincts within to take over.

8
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,916
Without distinguishing
between friend and foe,

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,375
Goku began trampling the Tuffle
planet with all his might.

Grandpa! Stop it!

If you destroy the planet,
you'll kill your family!

But just as Goku was about to

13
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,541
make waste of
everything before him,

14
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,041
his blind rage came
to a quick halt

15
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,083
as he caught sight
of the Earth.

25
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,333

Yes! He did it!

All that work
we've done training

for us big time!

Oh yeah! He's a
Super Saiyan Four!

Oh, wow! That's a
Super Saiyan Four?!

42
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,666
Amazing! You're telling me
that's the same little kid

43
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,750
whose tail we stretched out?!

44
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,208
Did I do all this?

45
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,458
Grandpa, don't you
remember what happened?

46
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,958
You turned into a giant gorilla

47
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,000
and started smashing
everything around you, even me!

48
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,666
Let's just be thankful that
I didn't have to step in.

49
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
Because I would have
knocked that Baby

50
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,875
back into the stone age!

51
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:18,166
However, I did notice good ol'
Goku has gotten much stronger!

52
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,625
But Grandpa, do you think

53
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,333
you'll ever get back
to your normal self?

54
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,375
Well, Pan...

55
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,833
This body and its amazing
powers are necessary right now.

56
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,625
It's the only way
to defeat Baby.

57
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,875
With Goku helping
me fight Baby,

58
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,416
he'll be a big pile of
mush when we're through!

59
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,208
That's right, Grandpa.

60
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,750
It's time you taught Baby that
he can't mess with our family

61
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,916
and get away with it!

62
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,625
Then that's what I'll do.

63
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,583
[SS4 GOKU] I know where
Baby's hiding right now

64
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,166
and if everything
goes smoothly,

65
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,333
Earth and all her people
will be back to normal

[BABY VEGETA] This is absurd!
I don't understand how

00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,375
he was able to convert
the energy from the Earth.

73

What I need to find out is why
it didn't affect me the same.

Why didn't it
affect Vegeta?

I demand an answer
to my question!

83
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,666
[BABY BULMA]
I believe that is because

84
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,375
Vegeta does
not have a tail.

[BABY VEGETA growling]

162
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,833
[BABY VEGETA growling]

163
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:43,166
[BABY VEGETA screams]

164
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,083
Lord Baby!

165
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,833
[BABY VEGETA groaning]

166
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,125
[BABY BULMA] I can't allow
him to fail like this!

167
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,541
If that Saiyan beats him, our
entire race will become extinct.

168
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,958
I've got to get the
Amplifier up and running.

169
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,500
It might be our only hope!

170
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,291
[BABY VEGETA screams]

171
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,500
[BABY VEGETA cackling]

172
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,250
[BABY VEGETA] It's fitting
for a moronic Saiyan

173
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
that your ignorance
is showing again.

174
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,416
Who do you think
you're fighting here?

175
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,291
It's certainly not your enemy.

176
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,333
This is your friend
Vegeta's body.

177
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,375
So you can keep attacking Goku,

178
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,166
but all you will be doing
is killing your friend.

179
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,416
Hm. That's funny,
I've fought Vegeta,

180
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,375
and this is nowhere
near his breaking point.

181
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,916
So, you understand his
limits. That's perfect.

182
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,666
We'll just push
this fight along

183
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,833
until we reach that
breaking point!

184
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,541
[SS4 GOKU] You act like you know
the Saiyans inside and out,

185
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,958
but the fact is your knowledge
is dangerously lacking.

186
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,250
What you don't realize
is the longer a Saiyan

187
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,958
continues to fight, the
stronger he becomes.

188
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,916
Your warrior race...
It's sickening.

189
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,791
[BABY VEGETA yells]

190
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,333
I'm sick of playing
games with you, Baby.

191
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,500
[BABY VEGETA screams]

192
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,916
[BABY VEGETA] This can't be
the limit of my powers!

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,083
[BABY BULMA] Lord Baby!
Pull yourself together!

194
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,541
Bulma?

195
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,333
[BABY BULMA] You can't allow
that Saiyan to defeat you.

196
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,416
Not now!

197
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,541
We've almost completed your
plans of galactic development,

198
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
and are just weeks away

199
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,875
from changing the entire
galaxy into Tuffles!

200
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,583
Plus, I've solved
your gorilla problem.

201
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,041
I've found a way to
focus the Blutz waves.

202
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,666
[BABY VEGETA] It's about time
I was seeing some results.

203
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,250
[BABY BULMA] Look over
towards our tower my lord.

204
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,958
[BABY BULMA] This is the
Blutz-Wave Amplifier!

205
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,333
Blutz-Wave-what?

206
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,208
That's right! The moon's Blutz
waves, reflected off the Earth

207
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,166
will increase by 1,000%

208
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,625
and be transferred to you
when it's activated.

209
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,041
That will give us
the power needed

210
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,125
to increase your strength
to a level past the Saiyan's

211
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,666
without having to wait
for a tail to grow!

212
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,208
That's fine.

213
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,791
But will I be able to control my
own actions under that power?

214
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,958
I... I don't want to
demolish my own planet.

215
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,625
I just want to kill the Saiyan.

216
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,166
[SS4 GOKU]
Heads up, Baby!

217
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,041
[SS4 GOKU]
Ka...Me...

218
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,916
Ha...Me...

219
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,000
Right now!

220
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,291
Yes! Do it!

221
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,083
[BABY VEGETA screaming]

222
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
What's he doing?

223
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:38,541
[BABY VEGETA screaming]

224
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,416
Oh man!

225
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,708
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

226
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,125
This is not good
Kibito, not good.

227
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,041
He's going to smash
his own planet to bits

228
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,708
and kill everyone!

229
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,125
Ancestor, how
did he do that?

230
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,708
Even though he
didn't have a tail,

231
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,875
he was still able to
complete a metamorphosis!

232
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,916
If he stays like that, soon
no one will be able to stop him.

233
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,791
I'm afraid the way
things are now,

234
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,875
a Super Saiyan Four
might not be enough.

235
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,083
No way!

236
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,791
[OLD KAI] What will
likely happen is Baby

237
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,875
will lose complete control as
his brain slowly erodes away.

238
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,333
He's becoming so rash that's
he's actually regressing to

239
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,208
a level of zero
conscious reasoning.

240
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,541
He will proceed to eradicate
everything in his path,

241
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,333
until nothing is left.

242
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,000
[BABY BULMA] We did it,
Lord Baby! It worked!

243
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,666
Now go destroy that Saiyan!

244
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,041
Don't stop until he's dead!

245
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:42,166
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

246
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,083
[PAN, HERCULE whimpering]

247
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,541
Oh no! Not another giant monkey!

248
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,416
It's not safe here now, Pan.

249
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,791
Let's get out of
here while we can.

250
00:21:53,666 --> 00:22:02,500
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

251
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,833
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

252
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:25,208
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

253
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,583
[NARRATOR] Goku has
become a Super Saiyan Four,

254
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,458
and victory seems inevitable.

255
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,958
But witnessing Baby
transform into a giant ape

256
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,166
throws every
ambition into question.

257
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,875
[SS4 GOKU] You're still not
gonna get away with this!

258
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,958
[NARRATOR] As the gorilla rages
on under Baby's control,

259
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,083
his strength continues to grow.

260
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,958
Soon, even Goku's new abilities

261
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,791
won't be enough to contain
this powerful menace!

262
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:53,500
Find out what happens,
on the next Dragon Ball GT!
