This is weird. The lake was
pitch black when he threw us in.

311
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,625
Why is the water so clean?
And how are we breathing?

312
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500
[PAN]
I'm not sure.

313
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,500
[GIRU] Living water! Giru
find magic living water!

314
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,666
[PAN] An underground spring.
That's why the water's so clear.

315
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,833
Let's blast it.

316
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,166
[GOKU]
Let's what?

317
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,583
[PAN]
If we blast it here,

318
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,291
the spring will flood
the lake with fresh water!

319
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,958
[GOKU]
It's worth a shot!

320
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,666
[PAN] Go for it, Grandpa.
I hope this works.

321
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,416
Ha!

322
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,833
[HAZE SHENRON cackling]

323
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,333
[HAZE SHENRON]
Their meat is falling off

324
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,916
their bones by now!
No more little pests!

325
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,625
Now nothing can stop me

326
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,458
from spreading my poison
across the Earth!

327
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,375
I have to admit, Haze Shenron,
you're a genius!

328
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,666
What? Something's moving?
That's impossible!

329
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,541
Everything's dead down there!

330
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,833
[HAZE SHENRON] Fresh water?
No! How can this be?

331
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,166
[GOKU]
Hey, dragon!

332
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,500
But, you should be dead!

333
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,791
It seems there was a little
life left in your lake!

334
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,375
That's right!
Fresh spring water, Haze!

335
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,416
Without it, we would
have been dead,

336
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,791
just like you're
going to be now!

337
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
[GOKU yelling]

338
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,291
[PAN yelling]

339
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:59,333
[HAZE SHENRON whimpering]

340
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,500
[BOTH]
Ha!

341
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,958
[HAZE SHENRON screaming]

342
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,375
[GOKU]
I think that did it! Alright!

343
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,291
[GOKU] Pan, look! The sky's
turning back to normal again!

344
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,833
[PAN] Awesome! Maybe the Dragon
Ball will go back to normal too!

345
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,250
Or maybe not.

346
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,583
[GOKU]
No, wait a second! Look!

347
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,250
[BOTH laughing]

348
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,500
No! Not the lake!

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,416
Well, have a nice swim.

350
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,375
What? Why do I have to go?

351
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,500
Why? Get real. Because!

352
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,791
I'm not going in that filthy,
stinking water again!

353
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,333
[GOKU] Hey! I was down
in that lake too,

354
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,250
and I don't want to go
back any more than you!

355
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,583
Well that's too bad!

356
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,708
I guess we'll just leave
the Dragon Ball here then

357
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,750
'cause I'm not going!

358
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,666
Me neither!

359
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,250
You dropped it!

360
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,666
[GIRU]
Giru!

361
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,125
Giru! Giru!

362
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,250
[BOTH]
Giru.

363
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,958
[PAN]
He's got the Dragon Ball!

364
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,458
Way to go, Giru!
You're incredible!

365
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:18,500
[GIRU]
Giru! Giru!

366
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,208
Wow, Giru! You're
braver than Grandpa!

367
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,166
Thanks.

368
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,083
[PAN] It's healthy and shiny
again! One down and six to go!

369
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,291
[ALL]
Yeah!

370
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,125
[NARRATOR] With the Two Star
Ball in their possession,

371
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,083
things are looking
a little brighter!

372
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,375
But with six evil
dragons on the loose,

373
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,291
the fate of the Earth is
still in the balance!

374
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,708
What strange powers do
these dark dragons possess?

375
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:53,375
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball GT!
