1
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:17,291
[NARRATOR] On the last GT, the
challenge was laid down by Goku

2
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,333
and taken up by Don Kee's
hired assassin, Ledgic.

3
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,625
A victory for Goku meant
the trio from Earth

4
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,833
could resume their journey.

5
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,166
A loss--
and their mission was over.

6
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,125
Kaaaa! Meeee!

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,416
Haaa! Meee! Haaaaa!!

8
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,083
[NARRATOR] At last the forces
of darkness were overcome

9
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,375
and the spaceship was repaired
and readied for flight.

10
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,125
But the Dragon Radar
was still questionable.

11
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,458
It looks like the Dragon
Radar is still in tact!

12
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,208
That's just great.

13
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,750
If the radar's part of him, then
we have to take him with us!

14
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,166
[NARRATOR] And so the crew of
three became four

15
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,166
and a course was set for
the nearest Dragon Ball.

16
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,458
The space voyagers are
finally back on track,

17
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,958
but valuable time has
been lost on Imecka.

18
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,708
The uncertain future of the
earth is still in their hands,

19
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,750
and the clock is ticking.

20
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,708
Hey, uh... What's your name?
Or do you even have a name?

21
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,833
[GIRU] Giru Giru Giru.
My name is T-Twenty-O-Six!

22
00:03:54,916 --> 00:04:00,250
Wow. T-Twenty-O-Six, huh?
Well, that's certainly unusual.

23
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,416
That's probably his
production number, Goku...

24
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,291
Maybe we could brainstorm
and think of a name for him.

25
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,625
[GIRU] Giru!
Giru! Giru! Giru!

26
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,458
[GIRU] Dragonball detected!
Dragonball detected!

27
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,500
There'd better be for your sake!

28
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,791
If you led us all the way out
here on a wild goose chase,

29
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,875
you're finished!
You got that, pal?

30
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,833
[GIRU]
Giru.

31
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,375
Pan, for his safety and yours,
you'd better sit down...

32
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,458
We're about to
enter the atmosphere.

33
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,125
[TRUNKS] We're through.
That wasn't so bad.

34
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,750
Hey! Nice handling! How about
we see what this thing can do!

35
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,583
[GOKU]
Yeah!

36
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,291
[PAN]
Careful, Trunks!

37
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,125
[GIRU] Atmosphere inhabitable.
Will sustain organic life.

38
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,125
We'll land beyond those rocks.

39
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,708
[impact]

40
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,958
[reverberation]

41
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,125
Can you try landing this thing
a little softer next time?!

42
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,958
You almost gave me whiplash!

43
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,333
[GIRU]
Giru.

44
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,333
Sorry about that...

45
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,583
Except for the crash,

46
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,916
this is the first time
I've landed this ship.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,666
[groans]

48
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,541
Let's see what
kind of food they have!

49
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,250
[ship creaking]

50
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,708
Trunks! What's the deal?!

51
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
But I didn't do anything.

52
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,333
[further creaking]

53
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Uhh! What's going on...?

54
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,708
It feels like an
earthquake! Look!

55
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,708
[PAN] The rocks are moving!
That can't be good, can it?

56
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
[TRUNKS] No!
That's definitely not good!

57
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,041
[roars]

58
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,375
[waves breaking]

59
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,583
That... was too close!

60
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,208
[PAN] I really hope that wasn't
a sign of things to come.

61
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,250
[GOKU]
Hey!

62
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
[TRUNKS]
How did you get out there?

63
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,833
Nevermind! You're not gonna to
believe this place! Come on!

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,625
Why does he get to fly?!
I'm going too!

65
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,166
How am I gonna put up with
those two for a whole year?!

66
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,125
[GIRU]
Giru.

Oh, man, this is fun!
And it sure beats walking!

69
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,291
Hey there, Grandpa. So?
What do you think?

70
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,208
I look just like
a bug, don't I?!

71
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,333
Yeah, I guess.

72
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,750
[groans]

73
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, would it be more
realistic if I bit you?!

so... beautiful!

Hey! Wait for me!

00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,125
[TRUNKS] There you are!
What are you guys doing?

77
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,083
We need to be looking for
the Dragon Ball! Not playing!

00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,958

Pan! Let's go!

80
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,625
She left with the butterflies.

81
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,000
She'll be fine.

82
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,375
Let's go get the Dragon Ball
and meet her back here.

83
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,041
Are you sure?

00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,166
[GOKU]
I'm positive! Come on!

What do we have here?

That would have hurt.

Did you guys
get the Dragon Ball?

105

Not exactly.

But if we lose her,
we're cooked!

Pan! Are you okay?!

163
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,666
Huh?

164
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,833
Oh, boy!

165
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,333
Trunks? Is she okay?

166
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,250
Well, she's a little shaken up.
But she'll be just fine.

167
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,291
[GOKU] That's not Pan!
She's too quiet to be Pan!

[buzzing]

00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,125

More honey. Gee, thanks.

Hey. Wait a second...

175
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,125
They're bringing me honey

176
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,958
because they think
I'm their queen.

177
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,625
Well I'm not ready for
that kinda responsibility!

178
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,833
I'm outta here!

Can't you guys
take no for an answer?!

182
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,041
Bees have no class!

00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041

[GOKU]
I know!

189
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,916
Who's that? My replacement?

190
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,458
No. She's just a bee that we
helped who had lost her way.

191
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,416
She's been through a lot.
She's still a little weak.

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,791
[GOKU] What's going on?
They're surrounding us!

194
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,458
And they mean business!

195
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,000
I know what's going on!

196
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,166
[PAN] I'm not your Queen, you
buzzing boneheads!

197
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,500
She's your Queen!

198
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,666
[GOKU] Imagine that.
Mistaking Pan for their Queen.

199
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,833
That's something else, alright.

200
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,250
It's called being
clueless, Grandpa!

201
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,583
I don't know...

202
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,875
Having a countless number
of personal attendants

203
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,458
does have its advantages, Pan.

204
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
I'll never eat honey again!

205
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,833
But Pan, to them honey is worth
more than diamonds and gold!

206
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,708
I guess you're right. How sweet.

207
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,291
That's strange...
Five readings.

00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,250
What?! Give me that!

209
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,958
Great! Now I'm not
getting any signal at all!

[GIRU]
Giru! Not broken.

00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,291
[GIRU] Radar not malfunctioning.
Energy too low.

Ahh! So that's it!
I should have known!

Well... On a planet
without any industry,

00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,583
we're going to be hard pressed

217
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,125
to find any metal
for Giru to eat.

218

A lot of good he is! Conking out
at an important time like this!

00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:48,791
[GIRU]
Giru.

Someone's cooking fish!

fish way out here? Come on!

[TRUNKS]
I know who!

00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,208
A giant lives out here!
We saw him earlier!

00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,958
Awesome! It must
be a huge fish!

227
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe we can sneak
a little nibble!

228
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,458
I saw him too. He's huge. He
might sneak a nibble out of us.

229
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,500
Over there, Trunks!

Let's go get that Dragon Ball!

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,833
[PAN] I was expecting the Giant
to be really mean and scary,

238
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,666
but he actually seems
kind of gentle. Don't you think?

239
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,833
Sssshh! He may seem gentle,

240
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,125
but that might change
if he finds us!

[PAN] Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

[GOKU] Aaah!
He's eating all the fish!

243
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,416
I need to get some
before it's all gone!

Get back here! Are you crazy?!

get the Dragon Ball first!

Then you can eat all you want!
We'll catch our own fish!

I'm afraid so! This is bad!

to save the planet, then

You're the one who wanted to
come on this mission.

You volunteered.

down another Dragon Ball

and come back for
this one later. You know...

Giru? I doubt he'd
object to that,

it does seem to be

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,291
[GIRU] Good!
Giru giru giru...!

321
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,333
[NARRATOR] With the
Four Star Ball in the bag,

322
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,750
spirits are high.

323
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,500
But what challenges await
the adventurers from Earth

324
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,750
as they continue to
search the galaxy

325
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:52,333
for the Black Star
Dragon Balls?
