00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,125
[NARRATOR]
On the last GT,

2
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,583
a Dragon Ball was discovered

3
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,958
in a small village
on a remote planet.

4
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,625
[TRUNKS]
Which one do they have?

5
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,333
Four! Five! Six!

6
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,500
[NARRATOR] But the villagers
had much bigger concerns

7
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,333
than to part with
a Dragon Ball!

8
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,666
Well, my peasants! Have you
decided on a bride for me yet?

9
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,083
What? A bride?
That's disgusting!

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,958
Fools! I like
when people beg me!

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,416
But, only a bride
will stop the quake!

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,083
[NARRATOR] The evil Zoonama
was threatening to destroy

13
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,041
the entire community unless
the villagers handed over

14
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,333
one of their young
women to be his bride!

15
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,833
[NARRATOR]
Let the magma flow!

16
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,833
[NARRATOR] Rather
than face total destruction,

17
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,750
the villagers agreed to meet
the monster's wicked demand!

18
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,833
However, the betrothed
wasn't a woman at all,

19
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,375
but a powerful warrior

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,333
carefully disguised to look
like the ultimate bride to be!

21
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,333
The plan: to infiltrate
Zoonama's lair

22
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,875
and cut off his
quake-producing whiskers!

23
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
Oh, well. I guess things...

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:24,083
[NARRATOR] Wedding bells ring,
today on Dragon Ball GT!

25
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,625
[ZOONAMA] Come closer, my sweet
Laine! Stop being so shy.

26
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,958
[TRUNKS] It's just that
I hardly know you.

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,083
Don't be afraid, silly!

28
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,958
I just want to see
your pretty face!

29
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,458
Uh, oh. This could get ugly.

30
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,666
[ZOONAMA]
Something's different about you,

31
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,916
but I can't put my finger on it.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,166
[TRUNKS] Uhh...
It must be the wedding dress!

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,583
Ahh? Hmm. Perhaps
you're right. It's your veil.

34
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,416
Why not take it off?

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,458
[TRUNKS] Great! What am I
going to do now? I'm sunk!

36
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,416
Come on! You're too stiff!
Be creative for goodness sake!

37
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,791
[TRUNKS]
I'm trying!

38
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,666
What's that, Laine?

39
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,833
[TRUNKS] I'm dying
to remove my veil!

40
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,333
But, it's not proper
'til we're alone!

41
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,250
[DOMA] Wow!
What a close call!

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
Trunks really came
through with that one!

43
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,583
[PAN] I don't know.
It seems like he's skating on

44
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,625
thin ice to me.

45
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,250
[GOKU] Hey!
Before the ice breaks,

46
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,416
what do you say we
attack Zoonama?

47
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,750
Are you nuts?

48
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
He could use a volcano to
torch the whole village!

49
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's use our heads!

50
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,916
[ZOONAMA] How cute!
What a refined young lady!

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,416
Oh! Why thank you!

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,333
Come Laine.
Let's go find some privacy!

53
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,333
[ZOONAMA] I know a place where
you can let your hair down!

54
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,166
[TRUNKS]
Where are we going, Zoonama?

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,541
Where else?
To my little love nest!

56
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,333
[PAN] All right! Everything is
working according to my plan!

57
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,083
Now let's go!
We can't lose sight of them.

58
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,750
You smell good!

59
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,166
Oh, you! Please!

60
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,125
Your skin is so soft!

61
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,625
[ZOONAMA] Laine!
Don't ever touch my whiskers!

62
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,750
Do you want me to
cause a volcano to erupt

63
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,875
and destroy your village?

64
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,833
[TRUNKS] But I was only
trying to protect you!

65
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,625
A mosquito landed on your
whisker and was about to bite!

66
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,333
I see. Sorry about that,
you sweet little thing!

67
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,041
Well, we're almost there!

68
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,791
[TRUNKS]
Almost where?

69
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,625
[ZOONAMA] To a place where no
one will ever bother us again!

70
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,458
It's my little secret!

71
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,583
[TRUNKS]
Oh, it's uh, nice!

72
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,875
[ZOONAMA] This isn't it, silly!
Now take a deep breath!

73
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,000
Huh. That's strange.
It's like they just disappeared.

74
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,416
[DOMA]
But we mustn't lose them.

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,875
That would put
Trunks in great danger!

76
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,500
[GIRU]
Must find Trunks! Giru!

77
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,916
Hey! No sweat, Doma! We're fine!
I can track anyone, anywhere!

78
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,166
[muffled groaning]

79
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,833
We're here!

80
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:53,500
[TRUNKS] Oh! Gosh, Zoonama!
It's... It's uh... It's so you!

81
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,125
That's weird. There are puddles,
but it hasn't rained.

82
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,541
What's up with that?

83
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,166
[DOMA]
Goku! Pan! Over here!

84
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,833
Look! This flower!

85
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,541
Isn't this one that Laine picked
out for Trunks' disguise?

86
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,375
I think you're right,
but would they have dove in?

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,833
[GOKU]
I'm gonna find out!

88
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,458
Geez! Put some clothes on, 
Grandpa! You're gross!

89
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,666
And hurry up with it,
this isn't a locker room.

90
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,875
Who do you think you are
parading around like that?

91
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,541
[GIRU]
Giru! Giru! Giru!

92
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,416
Be quiet!

93
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,416
[splash]

94
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,625
[GOKU] I wanted to
take a look under water,

95
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,958
and I never swim
with clothes on.

96
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
I don't see
what the big deal is.

97
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,125
We used to take baths
together all the time.

98
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,125
Liar!

99
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,750
I'm not lying.

100
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,541
[PAN] But that was
when I was a baby, right?

101
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,041
Well, I'm a young
woman now, Grandpa.

102
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,083
People grow up, you know, even
though you never seem to!

103
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,541
[GOKU] Well, I don't
want to grow up if it

104
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,541
means swimming with
your clothes on.

105
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,041
I'm not trying to be nosey Pan,

106
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,208
but is Goku
really your grandfather?

107
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,000
[PAN]
Yes! Unfortunately!

108
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:15,708
Strange. Here we start small
and grow big and then shrivel.

109
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,125
[GOKU]
There's a tunnel down there.

110
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,041
It looks like it
leads to some caverns!

111
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,791
I'll bet that's where
Zoonama took Trunks!

112
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,541
Laine, my dear! You should slip
into something more comfortable!

113
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,583
[TRUNKS] Oh, can you
pick something out for me?

114
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,958
[ZOONAMA]
I'd love to!

115
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:50,458
Lava! Oh great! That means
we're inside a volcano!

116
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,041
[ZOONAMA] I have the
perfect dress for you, my sweet!

117
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,958
[TRUNKS]
Oh! Thank you!

118
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,000
[confused groan]

119
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,791
[TRUNKS]
How pretty! I love it!

120
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:12,333
Y-You there.
You're not my Laine. Are you?

121
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,333
[stuttering]

122
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,541
Not good!

123
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,625
[ZOONAMA] How dare you!
No one tricks Zoonama and lives!

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,416
But you!
You're a different story!

125
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,125
I can forgive you
because you're so cute!

126
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,625
I love short hair
on young women!

127
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,416
And your physique! How athletic!
What's your name sweetheart?

128
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,791
Name? Oh, I'm Trunksette.

129
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,083
Trunksette! You are the cutest
thing that I've ever seen!

130
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,750
[TRUNKS] Man! This guy
really needs to get out more!

131
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,333
[bubbling]

132
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,291
Lovely isn't it? Don't be shy.
This is our wedding banquet.

133
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,291
Dig in, sweetie!

134
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,291
[TRUNKS] This is my chance.
It's now or never.

135
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,958
But first a toast to
our new found love!

136
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,541
Hmm? Okay!

137
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,833
[TRUNKS] Well,
here's to a long and happy

138
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,625
and healthy life together!

139
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:27,583
[ZOONAMA] Oh, how sweet!
You go ahead! I'm not thirsty.

140
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,666
Please! Don't let me
stop you, Trunksette!

141
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,000
Bottoms up!

142
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,250
But sweetie! It's our
wedding day! You have to!

143
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,958
No, I don't.

144
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,791
It's part of the celebration.

145
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,833
Hm?

146
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,750
Just one!

147
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,833
If you want it, you drink it!

148
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,375
[TRUNKS]
Think of something, Trunks!

149
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,375
[screams]

150
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,625
[ZOONAMA]
Hmm?

151
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,291
Oh, he's gone!
It was an ugly ol' bat!

152
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,916
Let's not let him
ruin our dinner!

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,208
[TRUNKS]
Zoonama!

154
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,291
Hmm?

155
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,458

00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,166
[TRUNKS]
It's too late!

315
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,541
Maybe not!

316
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,666
[DOMA]
He can fly?

317
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,000
Be careful, Grandpa!

318
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,208
[GOKU]
All righty then.

319
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,541
Now that she's let
some pressure out,

320
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,125
we can try to stop
the bleeding.

321
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,250
Maybe I can seal off the wound.

322
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,375
[GOKU]
Ka...

323
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,625
Me...

324
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,250
Ha...

325
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,875
Me...

326
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,708
Ha!

327
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,500
[PAN] It's completely gone!
He blew up the whole thing!

328
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,041
[DOMA]
How can this be?

329
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,125
[GOKU] Whoa! Man! I really
overdid it this time!

330
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,000
Oops! My bad!

331
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,583
[LAINE] Here you are! This is
for your bravery and prowess!

332
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,000
It was beyond all expectation!

333
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
Thank you, Laine!

334
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,958
Thank you! You've helped us
more than you know!

335
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,791
Yes, the three of you
made the impossible happen!

336
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,708
[DOMA] We never dreamed
that one day Zoonama

337
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,625
would join our village!

338
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,416
[LAINE] He's actually rather
gentle once you get to know him.

339
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,625
We think he'll fit in fine here.

340
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,291
[GOKU] Just don't give
him anything to drink!

341
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,875
Yes! That is good advice.

342
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,625
We will follow it and pray that
your people find peace as well.

343
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,875
Thanks, Doma!

344
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,416
[villagers chattering]

345
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,458
[evil laughter]

346
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,250
[LAINE'S FATHER]
He's taking the ball!

347
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,041
Give that back! It's ours!

348
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,333
[BON PARA] Thanks for
the Dragon Ball, suckers!

349
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,333
[lasers beaming]

350
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,875
[pained groans]

351
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,833
[NARRATOR] Who is this
mysterious alien who confiscated

352
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,000
the Dragon Ball?

353
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,708
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next GT!
