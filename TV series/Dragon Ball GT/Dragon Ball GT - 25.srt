00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,708
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT,

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,375
the Doctor was giving Trunks
a dose of evil medicine,

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,500
but it was Baby who
wrote the prescription!

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:25,458
Fortunately, Goku was there to
put an end to the malpractice.

5
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,416
You shouldn't have picked
a doctor to hide in.

6
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,166
I'm on guard 
against them as it is!

7
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,583
[NARRATOR] But the
scheming Neo-mutant

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,500
wasn't about to surrender!

9
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,666
What he lacked in terms 
of power, he intended to steal!

10
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,333
And in a flash,
he hijacked the body of Trunks

11
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,958
right before their very eyes!

12
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,166
[BABY as Trunks] I've never felt
anything like this before!

13
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,083
This is the Saiyan
power I desire!

[GOKU yelps]

16
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,166
Goodbye! Not even you can block

17
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,375
this blast from
point-blank range!

18
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,541
[PAN]
Trunks! Don't do it!

19
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,333
[TRUNKS yells]
Get out of my body!

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,500
[GOKU] That's it, Trunks!
Don't give in!

21
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,083
[NARRATOR] Unable to
withstand the sheer magnitude

22
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,625
of the Super Saiyan energy,

23
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,416
Baby made his escape

24
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,041
and Trunks regained control
of his body once and for all!

25
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:33,791
[GOKU]
He did it!

26

[GIRU]
Giru! Giru!

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,583
The battle for
the body had been won,

28
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,625
but the war for the
world was about to begin!

29
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,666
[BABY]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

[water running]

32
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,375
[GOTEN] You have one of the
prettiest faces I've ever seen,

33
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,958
and that's the truth!

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,208
No, really! I'm serious!

35
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,208
What? Why haven't I told you?

36
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,208
Because this is the first
time since I've known you 

37
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,416
that you haven't
had a boyfriend!

38

[BULMA giggles]

39
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,916
Please tell me!

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,791
Why can't he go after a girl
who hasn't had any boyfriends?

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,250
I married
my first boyfriend!

42
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,666
Huh? Seriously?
That's really sweet.

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,875
Hey! Let's go out!

44
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,166
If you're not too busy,

45
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,000
we could meet up
somewhere right now!

46
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,250
[GOTEN] No! I don't think it's
too sudden! Let's go for it!

47
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,166
Oh, my word! Doesn't this
generation have any humility?

48
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,791
[GOTEN]
Where? I don't know.

49
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,291
You name the place, 
and I'll be there!

50
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:56,333
Yeah. Right. I know the spot.
Sounds good, Valese!

51
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,291
[GOTEN]
I'll see you in a few! Huh?

52
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,375
Yeah! Of course, I do!
Okay, cool! Ciao!

Go get her, tiger!

act around those city women!

Huh? Mom, gimme a break!

Hey, Vegeta! What's up?

See ya later! I've got a date!

[VEGETA]
Goten! Just a second!

60
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,958
Notice anything...
different? Huh?

Uh, whatd'ya mean?

62

[VEGETA] Well, hey, uh,
I've really gotta boogie!

63
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,541
This is one girl you
don't want to keep waiting!

[VEGETA growls]

Well, well! Don't you look
especially handsome today, hun!

Why, thank you!

00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Notice anything different
about Vegeta today, ChiChi?

68

[CHICHI]
Huh.

00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,750
I shaved my mustache, you idiot!

He thinks it should
be front-page news.

Huh. Did he shave it
for any special reason?

72
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,375
You could say that.

73

Look, Dad!

74
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,208
That mustache has got to go!

00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,541
It makes you look
like a total geek!

[BULMA] Do you ever
think about them, Chichi?

83
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,916
How they're doing up there?

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,458
[CHICHI] Of course. Every minute
of every day. And you know what?

00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,666
I don't care if they
don't make it back in time.

I don't care if the
world disintegrates!

Goku's up there!
It'll all work out!

I hope so. But he's just
a boy now, not a man.

Yeah, that's true,

[NARRATOR] Unaware that
Baby has made his way to Earth,

318
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:37,208
Trunks, Goku, and Pan casually
continue their homeward journey!

Goten has laid down the law,

320
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,583
but now that Baby
has further developed,

321
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,125
does he have
the power to enforce it?
