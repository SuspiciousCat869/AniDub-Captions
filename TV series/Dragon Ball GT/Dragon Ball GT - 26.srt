00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:21,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,708
The sinister robot Baby
moved from victim to victim

3
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,166
as he continued his
search for the Saiyans.

4
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,750
Sound good? I'd like to use
it to defeat your father.

5
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,458
Hey, what's so funny?
I must have missed something.

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,791
[NARRATOR]
With Goten before him,

7
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,291
Baby's first true battle
with a Saiyan is at hand.

8
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,166
Can Goten put up
the kind of fight

9
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,083
it will take to stop
this evil entity

10
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,583
from taking over
his body as well?

11
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,916
Find out right now
on Dragon Ball GT!

12
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,458
Hm... Ok, so you're tough.

13
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,916
But I'd hardly call
you a great fighter.

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,916
What?!

15
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:39,750
[cellphone ringing]

16
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,708
Hello, this is Goten...
I'm kinda busy right now.

17
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,166
Goten it's me.
You're not hurt are you?

18
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
Oh... Valese, it's you.

19
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,250
No, I'm fine. Haven't
even broken a sweat yet.

20
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,791
It's really not as bad as
it might look from down there.

21
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,375
If you wanna hang
around for a few minutes

22
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,750
while I wrap this up,
I'd love to finish our date.

23
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,750
Goten, look out!
He's coming right for you!

24
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,416
What? Oh--

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,458
[VALESE]
Get out of there!

26
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,666
[BABY thinking]
Hmph... Saiyan power.

27
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,125
This one isn't even half
as strong as I expected.

28
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,250
That's embarrassing!

29
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,375
You should really try harder
to back up your mouth.

30
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,625
Goten, are you there?!

31
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,375
That was so cool. I never
expected that from you.

32
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,416
It runs in the family...

33
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, the whole idea
of protecting the innocent.

34
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,083
Yeah... That's my boy!

35
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,833
Spoken like a true
champ, Goten!

36
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,958
You sure have learned
a lot from me!

37
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,083
Goten, did he get you?!

38
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,916
Uh, no. It's just a scratch.
Nothing to worry about.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,958
I'll talk to you in a bit, okay?

40
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,583
Now that was embarrassing...
You'll pay for that!

41
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,708
[GOTEN yells]

42
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,666
[BABY] Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for--

43
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,375
the peak of your Saiyan power.

44
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,916
Wow... What's happening to him?
He looks like a beautiful angel.

45
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,708
I think I'm in love.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!

47
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,708
And that's that.

48
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:30,583
[BABY] Is that as high as your
puny Saiyan powers can reach?

49
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,416
[GOTEN]
Ka...

50
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,458
Me... Ha...

51
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,166
Me...

52
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,541
[BABY]
That's it...

53
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,875
Just release this
one blast of energy,

54
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,250
and your physical
power will top out.

55
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,833
And at that moment

56
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:56,041
the chance for me to transfer
to your body will be at hand.

57
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,916
Ha!!

58
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,916
Now!

59
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,250
[BABY as GOTEN]
This energy feels so rich.

60
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,666
Finally, the Saiyan power
I've been aching for is mine!

61
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,208
I may have failed with Trunks,

62
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,625
but today I've
grasped my destiny!

63
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,041
[BABY as GOTEN yells]

64
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,125
Wow... That was cool.

65
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,458
Uh, did you see
what happened?

66
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,625
Goten, you're okay!

67
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,666
Anybody see where

68
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,083
that baby-doll-looking
freak ran off to?

69
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,958
This... is the best date ever.

70
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,458
[BABY as GOTEN growls]

71
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,083
Oh... she' s yours.

72
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,833
Obviously, you're a
strong enough young man

73
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,416
that we don't have
to call off our date

74
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,083
for a little scratch, right?

75
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,958
There you go... So, what do you
say we get something to eat?

76
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,125
Are you okay?

77
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,666
[BABY as GOTEN thinking]
This is amazing.

78
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,916
Through the eyes of Goten,

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,750
I can see everything in
this world so clearly.

80
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,125
Ah, there are
Saiyans in West City.

81
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,541
But more importantly...

82
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,875
Who is the strongest
of them all?

83
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,500
Vegeta.

84
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,625
Yeah... That was
one heck of a job...

85
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,708
Hey, don't be mad at me 'cause
I was holding onto your girl.

86
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,416
I was just hiding behind her
'cause I was a little scared.

87
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,958
Let me, scratch that.

88
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:22,708
Wow, what a temper... Maybe
my training was too aggressive.

89
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,375
Wait, where are you going?
What about me?

90
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,250
He... doesn't seem like himself.

91
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,458
Of course not.
Now, he's mysterious...

92
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,208
It weighs heavy on his soul

93
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,958
that he had to destroy
another creature.

94
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,583
Vegeta...

95
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,375
If I acquire his Saiyan power

96
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,750
then my strength will surpass
both Trunks and Goku.

97
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,708
Soon the universe will bow
when they hear the name Baby!

Ball is somewhere in this lake.

How deep is it?

That should do it.

[TRUNKS] Ah, Goku
are you crazy?!

you creep! Spit him out!

My grandpa didn't
mean to hurt you.

I hope that

That's right...
Just one more to go!

Why are you looking
so glum, Grandpa?

130
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,833
Soon, we'll be able to
go home, save the earth,

131
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,000
and live out our
days as heroes.

132

I'm not worried
about the Dragon Balls.

It's... Baby...

I was positive he would come
after us but he hasn't...

135
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,625
I'm wondering if we
really got rid of him

136
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,708
or if he's hiding somewhere
while we get comfortable.

137
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,375
You're right.
There's an eerie feeling here,

like the calm that always
comes right before the storm.

Stop worrying... He put up
his best fight, but we won.

It's that simple.

I need an aspirin.

161
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,708
There was some kind of
a fight in West City.

162
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,208
And it appears Goten got
dragged into it somehow.

163
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,666
[CHICHI spits out water]

164
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,708
[CHICHI coughs]

165
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,791
Did somebody hurt my Goten?

166
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,166
[VIDEL] It was
just a scratch.

167
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,625
Gohan... I want you
to find your brother

168
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,125
and bring him back to me.

169
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,708
I swear, I warned him about
going out with that girl!

170
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,666
Hey... don't get
so worked up...

171
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,208
I'm sure Goten will
call you when he can...

172
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,583
So... Which room can
I drop my things in?

173
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,000
You go ahead and pick
whichever room you like best.

174
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,541
Doesn't anybody
care about my son?

175
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,083
Are you alright?

176
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,916
Goten?

177
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,666
You... You're home!
I'm so glad you're okay!

178
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,458
[BABY as GOTEN thinking] This
must be the one he calls mother.

179
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
So you did get
hurt out there!

180
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,166
Get away from me!

181
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,791
Then... are you hungry?

182
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,333
Vegeta...

183
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,208
Tell me where Vegeta is.

184
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,291
[BABY as GOTEN thinking]
So the mother is a fighter, too.

185
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,791
How dare you walk in
here and act like that?

186
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,291
You show some respect...
Do you hear me?!

187
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,500
[BABY as GOTEN thinking] What
an overwhelming personality.

188
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,791
She may be physically
weaker than the others,

189
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,500
but in Goten's mind she is
more important than anything.

190
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,000
Perhaps her powers are
hidden deep inside her.

191
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:50,166
Are you listening? You answer
me when I'm talking to you!

192
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,000
Perhaps it is best for me

193
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:57,125
to abide by the customs of
this planet until I find Vegeta.

194
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,208
So where is Vegeta?
Tell me now.

195
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,166
[CHICHI]
What is wrong with you?!

196
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,958
Didn't I teach
you any manners?

197
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,208
Will someone please
tell me where he is?

198
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,875
Well...

199
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,208
You know Vegeta...

200
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,583
He runs off all the time

201
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,833
without telling anyone
where he's going...

202
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,250
Why don't you just wait
around for him to show up?

203
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,083
[BABY as GOTEN thinking]
Oh, just perfect.

204
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,125
[GOHAN] Goten, you're back.
How'd it go?

205
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,958
[BABY as GOTEN thinking]
Who is this?

206
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,833
I sense more power in
him than in Goten.

207
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,500
Perhaps I should transfer
myself over to his body

208
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,083
so I can better acquire Vegeta.

209
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,416
What's wrong?

210
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,333
Did your date not go off
as well as you wanted it to?

211
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,500
What did you do that for?

212
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,416
Well...
You're the one who walked in

213
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,875
and started making fun of me!

214
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,500
Can't you take it?

215
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,250
I can take it. Even though
you're acting like a baby.

216
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,583
Shut up!

217
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,000
You two are together
five seconds

218
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,458
and you're fighting again!

219
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,166
Can't my house have some peace
and quiet just for once?

220
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,166
Take it outside!

221
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,833
Fine... Let's go then.

222
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,208
I'm ready when you are.

223
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,958
I hope they don't
hurt each other.

224
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,375
This kind of sibling rivalry

225
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,625
just proves their
love for each other.

226
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,708
Gohan... are you sure
your brother is okay?

227
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,375
He gets like this.

228
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,000
Would you mind holding this for
me? I won't be gone too long.

229
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,625
I'll be waiting.

230
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,041
Goten... Follow me!

231
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,125
My mother can overreact some,

232
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,666
which is why I didn't
say anything earlier...

233
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,416
So what have you
done with my brother?

234
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,083
You Saiyans are perceptive
little snots, aren't you?

235
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,708
Wait... The force of
that was much too weak.

236
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,041
I wonder if he's holding
some of his power back.

237
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,458
[GOHAN]
Tell me who you are!

238
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,250
[BABY as GOTEN] This "Gohan"
has the kind of body

239
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,625
that can stand up
to brutal attacks.

240
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,583
That is exactly
the type of vessel I need.

241
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,500
I can't stay here
and fight this guy.

242
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,000
That's Goten's body,
but some kind of being

243
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,625
has gotten inside
and possessed him.

244
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,500
So if I attack him and win, then
I'll be killing my own brother.

245
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,083
Ready?!

246
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,208
Wow, I did it--

247
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,166
There's something
different about this Saiyan.

248
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,583
Does he know somehow
that I wait for the moment

249
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,375
that they power-up
before I make my move?

250
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,916
Is that why he's 
waiting to attack?

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,500
I have to stop this.
But how do I save Goten?

252
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,541
Or is he simply a coward?

253
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:12,333
I can't fight him... I have
to... think of something...

254
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,916
He's dead set on hiding
that Saiyan power of his

255
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,833
until I dig it out.

256
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,208
Which is precisely
what I intend to do.

257
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,333
Come on, Gohan... You...

258
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:30,333
...need to show me what a true
Saiyan warrior is capable of--

259
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,208
No! Goten, stop him...
He'll kill us all!

260
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,000
[BABY as GOTEN yells]

261
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,208
Listen to me Goten!
He'll destroy everything!

262
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:02,000
[BABY as GOTEN screams]

263
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,041
Finally, the power
I've been waiting for...

264
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,666
Now this is what I've come
to expect of Saiyan power.

265
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,083
This is the kind of
ability and control I need!

266
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,833
You're a parasite...

267
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,375
You've lived off of my friends'
bodies long enough....

268
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,750
Show yourself.

269
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,666
The Namekian, Piccolo.

270
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,458
One of the most brilliant
fighters in the galaxy...

271
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,333
I would say you're the perfect
candidate on which I can...

272
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,583
...try out my new skills.
What do you say?

273
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,166
Fine.

274
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,666
Ka... Me... Ha... Me... Ha!!

275
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:26,000
[[BABY as GOTEN yells]

276
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,583
This is becoming
disappointingly easy.

277
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,166
Two Saiyans and
one Namekian down.

278
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,500
Now all I have to do is
find the one and only Vegeta.

279
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,541
That is where the true power is.

280
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,333
[NARRATOR] With Goten and
Piccolo out of commission,

281
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,250
Baby continues
his hunt for Vegeta.

282
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,541
Can the Saiyan Prince

283
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,000
stop the powerful
mutant's escalating terror,

284
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,333
or will he be the next to fall?

285
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,958
Find out on
the next Dragon Ball GT!
