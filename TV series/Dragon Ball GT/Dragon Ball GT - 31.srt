[NARRATOR]
Previously on GT,

2
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,500
the Revenge Death Ball was
closing in fast on Goku,

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,083
until the ever-watchful
Kibito Kai snatched him

4
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,708
out of harm's way!

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:25,250
But after making the catch, 
the great Kai fumbled the ball!

6
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,083
And Goku was dropped
into Sugoroku Space--

7
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,625
a twisted dimension 
where to survive,

8
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,833
one had to stake one's very life
on a bizarre game of chance!

9
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,583
My powers don't work there!

10
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,333
He's going to have to find 
a way out on his own somehow!

11
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,333
Do you have any idea what 
the odds of him doing that are?

12
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,416
This is the biggest bungle
a Kai has made since...

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,666
[GOKU] Tell me how to
get out of here right now!

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,666
[SUGORO] There's only one
way out of Sugoroku Space...

15
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,166
...and
that's to beat me!

16
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,791
Come on! It'll be fun!

17
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,250
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the parasitic Tuffles were

18
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,583
migrating to their new planet
using a gigantic spaceship

19
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,250
and the hijacked bodies
of the Earthlings!

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,416
The Tuffles have
conquered at last!

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,041
We are whole again!
And now we will spread!

22
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,875
Until the whole
Universe is ours!

[BABY laughs maniacally]

24
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,375
Oh, look! Another six!
This is amazing!

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,083
[GOKU] Your luck's bound
to run out sometime, Sugoro!

26
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,125
You've been burned! Lose a turn!

27

[NARRATOR]
Has Goku staked his very life

28
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,208
on a game that can't be won?

29
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,333

00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,583
[GOKU stammering]
Hot!

32
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,708
Hey, you'd better hurry up,
I've almost reached the end!

33
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:11,208
If I roll a four, I win! See!
That's the last space there!

34
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,291
Oh man! I didn't know
you were that far already.

35
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,625
[SUGORO]
Good luck, Goku!

36
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
He sure is being nice to me!

37
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,833
Come on, Six!

00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,291
Uh, oh!
It's going into the lava!

[DICE yells]

41
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,416
Did you hear that, Sugoro?

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,750
[SUGORO]
U-Uhh! Hear what?

43
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,083
I thought I heard it yell
when it almost fell in.

44
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,500
[SUGORO]
Yell?

45
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,000
Weird, huh?

46
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,708
[SUGORO] H-Hey!
What are you doing, silly!

47
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,041
Gosh! Everyone knows
that only little children

48
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
can hear dice talk!

49
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,458
But you're not a child.

50
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:24,875
No I'm not. But I could have
sworn that I heard it yell. Huh?

51
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,541
I know! Let's try it
again and see what happens!

52

[GOKU] Listen, Sugoro.
Tell me if you hear anything.

No! Stop!

I don't want to, Daddy!
It's too hot!

56
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,583
Did... he say daddy?

What do you think you're doing?!
Change back! Right this instant!

I don't want to, Daddy.

You don't want to?

[GOKU]
Well, well!

61
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,583
And what do we have here?

62
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,833
It looks like
you've been caught

63
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,166
with your hand
in the cookie jar!

64
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,791
The game! The dice!
It's all clear now!

65
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:22,333
Goku! Please! Don't say anymore!
I beg you! Please!

66
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,833
I don't know who
you really are, Sugoro!

67
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,958
But you're a cheat,
and a fraud!

68
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,833
Oh, no! Don't say that!

69
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,625
You mean he's been
cheating the whole time?

70
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,875
A fraud!

71
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,541
Unbelievable! How shameful!

72
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,208
Controlling the game
is tampering with fate!

73
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,750
What a disgrace!
He should be punished!

Guilty!

00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,291

Oh, man! The whole place
is shaking apart! Sugoro?

Daddy?

79

This is the end, Son! Be brave!

80
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:13,583
Sugoro! You have altered the
natural chance of the Universe!

81
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,583
This game has been corrupted
and must be destroyed

82

along with you and your son!

[GOKU] There's got to be
a way out of this place!

84
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,166
I don't want to die, Daddy!

85
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,166
You saved us even
though I cheated you!

86
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,416
I'm sorry, Goku!
Please forgive me!

87
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,166
Would you mind telling me what
in the world's going on?!

88
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,500
Whose voices were those?!

89

The Caretakers!

90
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,375
This dimension is a doorway
between life and death!

91
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,791
They oversee the game of fate

92
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,541
that decides whether
you die or go free!

93
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,750
But you've won so many games!

94
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,500
I keep choosing to stay!

95
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,875
My ship was destroyed!
We're marooned here!

96
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,708
We have no way home! We have
to keep winning to stay alive!

97
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,166
You have cheated death
for the last time Sugoro!

98
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
Your winning streak is over!

99
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,958
We have to make it to
that door up there, Goku!

100
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,083
Daddy!

101
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,875
It's fly or die!

Yes! My powers
are working again!

103

Gotcha!

00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,125
That was close!

105

Goku! Your powers are working!

106
00:08:56,166 --> 00:09:00,375
It's a miracle! Maybe it's
because the game is collapsing!

107
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,833
Yeah, we'll be all right as
long as I can use my power!

108
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,375
We'll just make our
own doorway out of here!

109
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,583
You'd better hold
on tight, Sugoro!

110

I must have been out of my mind!

through this dimension,

there's no guarantee
we'll be able to survive

158
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,333
Then, using some unknown
technique, we zap those aliens

159
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
like horseflies in a bug light!

160
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,750
But how do we get there?

161
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,541
Everybody knows what
we look like, Pan.

162
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,083
Then we'll just have to make
a few changes! Won't we, Buu?

163
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,250
Where is everyone
going on that ship?

164
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,791
To Baby's old home planet.

165
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,291
He used the Dragon Balls to
wish it back into existence.

166
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,166
What? The Dragon Balls?

167
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,166
But I gave those
to Popo and Dende!

168
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,333
Surely, they hid
them somewhere!

169
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,250
Dende and Popo were 
already under Baby's control

170
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,208
when you gave them
the Dragonballs.

171
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:15,208
Huh? The guardian of the Earth--
a Tuffle? That's not good.

172
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,958
No it's not. Even
Kibito Kai was on Earth.

173
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,916
Ancestor! Are you implying
that even I was infected?

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,875
Calm down, Kibito.
It was just a joke, you dufus.

175
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, I see. It's that
Old Kai humor again.

176
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,333
Well, I'm good to go, you
guys! Whenever you're ready!

177
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,625
What do you mean-- good to go?

178
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,625
I mean I'm ready for you
guys to drop me off on Earth!

179
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,541
I've got a baby to fight!

180
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,041
Forget it!

181
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,625
You couldn't beat defeat Baby
in your present condition.

182
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,583
Not only does he have
Vegeta's power at his disposal,

183
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,125
he also has the energy
that your two sons

184
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,708
and Trunks and Bulla gave him

185
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,375
to fuel his latest
transformation.

186
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,375
We're talking about a
being of immeasurable power!

187
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,208
And you're not even
capable of sustaining

188
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,125
Super Saiyan Three anymore!

189
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,500
If you fight him
now, you'll die!

190
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,291
Just as you would have if Kibito
Kai hadn't come to your rescue!

191
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,791
I don't care! I can't just stand
around while he ruins the Earth!

192
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
Now who said anything
about standing around?

193
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
We're going to train you, Goku!

194
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,083
What? Really?! Awesome!

195
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,250
Training with the two of you 
in the Sacred Land of the Kais!

196
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,750
This is like a dream come true!

197
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,541
Wow! Let's get right to it!

198
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,416
I hope we don't wreck
your planet too bad!

199
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,958
Pardon!

200
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,916
No problem! My name's Holly!

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I hope we get a chance to
sit together on the flight!

202
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,166
It's working!

203
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,416
Hey! Don't I know you?

204
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,000
Uh, oh!

205
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,375
Speak, Buu! Please!

206
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,250
Me? No, I don't
believe we've met.

207
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,208
Well, look. You really
shouldn't cut in line.

208
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,583
Yes, you're right.
My name's... Bo!

209
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,375
I'm Krillin! I hear that
the planet is beautiful!

210
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,041
I'm taking my whole family.

211
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,875
Are you going alone?

212
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,583
No. I'm carrying some
friends along with me.

213
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,541
He blew our cover!

214
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,666
Yeah! I'm carrying a few
extra pounds around myself!

215
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,875
Not much time to
workout these days!

216
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,208
Keeping them happy
is a full time job!

217
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,458
Oh! Hi!!

218
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,000
They're worth it, I guess.

219
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,833
Even though my wife can be a
real pain in the you-know-what

220
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,208
if she doesn't have
every little thing her way!

221
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,750
Ninety-seven! Ninety-eight!
Ninety-nine! One hundred!

222
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,000
Quiet down! 
Everyone pay attention!

223
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,250
Those of you behind this
line must remain on Earth

224
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,458
and wait for further
orders from Baby!

225
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,250
We made it!

226
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,125
Well, so long! Bye!

227
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:58,000
Bye, Bo! See ya!
Thanks for cutting in line!

228
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,375
And taking my place!
Hey, wait! That's my spot!

229
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,583
Good job. 
Why am I not surprised?

230
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,958
Why me?

231
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,416
That's it! Steady as she goes!

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,750
Hey! Is this really
going to make me stronger?

233
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,791
What? Of course it is!
Now keep turning!

234
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,791
Can you think of a
better way to draw out

235
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,833
your latent abilities
than this?! Huh?

236
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,500
I bet he's just too lazy to
grind his own coffee beans.

237
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,666
I'll probably be
shining his shoes next.

238
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,416
Why you... 
Ungrateful generation!

239
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,916
How dare you 
question my methods!

240
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,041
All right! I'll keep
turning! But it's boring.

241
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,375
And my tailbone
is starting to itch.

242
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,625
Heh, heh!

243
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,166
Hey! What are you doing?
You're going to burn the beans!

244
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,750
The flavor will be ruined!

245
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,083
Look, guys! There he is! Baby!

246
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,958
Time for the big rescue!

247
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,875
Let's go!

248
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,791
We can't just go
rushing out there!

249
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,833
We need a plan! A good plan!

250
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,625
I've gotcha covered, Gramps!

251
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
We're gonna flush those
eggs out with this!

252
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
Look! It's a laxative!

253
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,083
A laxative! I see!

254
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,000
That's a great plan,
Pan, but ya know what?

255
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,666
I think maybe we should 
think about it a little bit!

256
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,125
Try to come up with
something better, maybe!

257
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,625
C'mon, Gramps!
We've come this far!

258
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,041
Don't back out on me now!
Here! Take some ammo!

259
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,875
Aim for the backs of their
throats, guys! Let's go!

260
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:43,416
Oh, no! What a stupid
plan, Buu! We're doomed!

261
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,875
Baby wears diapers and
the Tuffles have bad breath!

262
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,375
Intruder! Get her!

263
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,875
That's it!
Keep yelling! Open wide!

264
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,416
Down the hatch!

265
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,958
What's this? How dare
she defile our new planet!

266
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,250
No way! I-It's actually working!

267
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,458
No! Pan! Gramps is coming!

268
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,500
Take this, Mom! It will
turn you back to normal!

269
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,125
Please, Mom!

270
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,208
Mom! It's me! It's Pan!
Don't you remember me?

271
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,708
Of course,
I remember you! Daughter!

272
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,250
I'm glad you're here, Pan!

273
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,916
Your mother and I have
been worried about you!

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Daddy!

275
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:51,083
Pan... It's okay. As soon as you
join us your pain will go away!

276
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,250
Please! Don't let them
do this to us, Dad!

277
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,875
Fight! Fight! You can do it!

278
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,125
Pan! That's enough! We're quite
happy with this new arrangement!

279
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,541
As will you be!

280
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,791
We have no use
for this one! Kill her!

281
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,041
Sir!

282
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:09,458
Dad! Don't do it! Please, daddy!

283
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,458
How much longer, Old Kai?

284
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,416
Just keep it up. I'll
let you know when to stop.

285
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,958
I can tell it's working,
the aroma is magnificent!

286
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,916
I don't hear any grinding!

287
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,500
It's Pan! They have her!
She's in serious danger!

288
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,000
What?! Pan?!

289
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,916
You have to let me go!

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,625
I can't Goku! You're not ready!

291
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,125
But she's my granddaughter!

292
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm well aware of
that Goku! I'm sorry!

293
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,166
So what?!

294
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,500
We're supposed to
just stand here

295
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,666
and watch those
beasts kill her?!

296
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,833
Please, Old Kai! Let me go!

297
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,625
I can't.

298
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,583
[PAN] Daddy, stop!
You're hurting me!

299
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,416
[PAN] You're not my daddy.
He'd never do this.

300
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,875
[GOHAN giggles]
Die!

301
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,666
[NARRATOR]
As fast as lightning,

302
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,083
a mystery man has appeared
and saved Pan's life!

303
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,000
The valiant warrior is
none other than Uub,

304
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,625
Goku's hand-picked student

305
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,083
who has come to do the
bidding of his master!

306
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,958
Your conflict is with me now!
