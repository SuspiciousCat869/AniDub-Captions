[NARRATOR] On the last GT,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,250
Omega Shenron revealed
that he had the powers

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,666
of all the Shadow Dragons
at his disposal!

4
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,541
Finding himself outmatched,

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,750
Goku was forced to resort
to desperate measures.

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,750
Let go, you coward!

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,750
No! Dad's converting
his life force into energy!

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,000
He's making a bomb
out of his body!

9
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,250
At Vegeta's behest,
Goku abandoned his plan.

10
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,916
The Saiyan Prince had
something different in mind.

11
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,791
Using Blutz Waves
as a catalyst,

12
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,166
Vegeta intended to transform,

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,083
first into a giant ape,
then into a Super Saiyan 4,

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,333
the summit of Saiyan power!

15
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,208
Although he found success,

16
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,083
two Super Saiyan 4's
wouldn't be enough!

17
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,708
Goku was still preparing
to die for the cause!

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,916
You know I wouldn't
suggest joining bodies

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,416
with you unless it
was our only hope.

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,625
Witness the ultimate
Saiyan fusion today on GT!

21
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,083
Did I hear Vegeta say Fusion?

22
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,666
Yeah, but will it work?

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,083
Sure! Why not?

24
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,458
Trunks and I were able to
do it as Super Saiyan 3's!

25
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,250
What's the difference?

26
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,958
Yes, of course.

27
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,125
What a great idea!

28
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,625
Father!

29
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,583
Whoa! Hey!
What's all the fuss about?

30
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,375
What in the world is fusion?

31
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,458
Well, here goes! 
Let's do it!

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,500
Before he decides to attack!

33
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,416
Mmm!

34
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,291
Whatever they're planning,
it won't work.

35
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,291
I'll make sure of that!

36
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,583
Father! Goku! What are
you two waiting for?

37
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,083
Go for it!

38
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,625
And just what were
you planning to do?

39
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,875
Keep your dirty hands
off of my son, you bully!

40
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,208
Mother!

41
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,875
How dare you!
Shooting a defenseless lady!

42
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,958
If I could fly I'd come up there
and show you a thing or two!

43
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,958
Gohan! Goten!

44
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,583
Goten! This is it!

45
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,083
This is our last chance!

46
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,833
If he stops them from 
doing Fusion, we're history!

47
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,583
I'll do whatever it takes!

48
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,666
Will somebody please
tell me what Fusion is?!

49
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,875
Gohan! That's it!

50
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,208
You annoying little pests!

51
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,375
What's going on through
that head of yours?

52
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:07,208
Kakarot! Are we going
to use Fusion or not?!

53
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,000
Have you lost your mind?!
What are you doing?!

54
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,000
Just soaking it all in.
This is great.

55
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,041
Watching our sons
fight together.

56
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,083
It doesn't get any
better than this.

57
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,625
Yeah, great. Come on.

58
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,125
This going to be special.
I can feel it.

59
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,708
Oh, no you don't!

60
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,208
Sorry! No Dragons allowed!

61

Huh?

68
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,625
Where are the other two?!

69
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:21,291
The Saiyans? They're here.
I am they. We are one.

70
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,708
Unfortunately for you, Omega.

71
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,166
Wow! He never
even touched him!

72
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,750
How awesome!

73
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,833
Grandpa and Vegeta have joined
their bodies like Siamese Twins!

74
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,291
Not exactly.

75
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,875
They're not two separate beings

76
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,708
that are attached together.
They're one being.

77
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,166
That's what Fusion is, Pan!
Two beings become one!

78
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,666
That is so cool!

79
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,375
I'd like to give
it a shot myself.

80
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,875
The Fusion I mean.
I wanna give it a shot.

81
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,666
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'd like to try it too someday.

82
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,791
Not someday, I mean right now
if one of you guys is up for it.

83
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,791
What do you say, guys?

84
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,875
We could help your dads
with that kind of power!

85
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,291
Well, how about it, Gohan?
Trunks! What about you?

86
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,333
Sorry, it wouldn't work.

87
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,416
To do Fusion you have to have
the exact same power levels.

88
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,916
You need to let
your body heal first.

Stupid fools!

00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,000
Now I can kill
you both at once!

91

Heh. Three hard punches, and
all you've got is a bloody nose.

92
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,833
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

What do you mean three?

95
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:19,291
I'll slow 'em down so you
can count 'em this time.

96
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,416
You shouldn't be
able to do that!

97

They're taking control! 
It's too good to be true!

What did you expect?

Nobody can mess
with our husbands

100

when they work together!

You may have
increased your power,

00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,541
and armed me with this power,

165
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,625
and I intend to use it!

166
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,541
Negative Karma Ball!

167
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,458
Trunks! Goten! Let's move!

168
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,250
It's no use.
There's no point in running.

169
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,708
If that blast hits, the entire
planet will be ripped apart.

170
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,291
We'll all die anyway.

171
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,041
Ancestor! You're not
going to believe this!

172
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,791
There's been a
change in the Earth!

173
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,000
You've got to see this!

174
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,333
I'm like Goku.

175
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,750
I don't like to work on
an empty stomach, you see.

176
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,458
Not yet! You'll ruin it!
You'll have to wait!

177
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,583
Show some restraint, Ancestor!
Watch the crystal ball!

178
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,250
The negative energy enveloping
the Earth has been lifted!

179
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,875
It's gone!

180
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,708
Oh...

181
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,541
Do you notice anything
different, Omega Shenron?

182
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,416
Does the world seem a
little brighter to you?

183
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,958
Brighter? What do you mean?

184
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,666
Before I kicked your Negative
Karma Ball into outer space,

185
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,208
I changed it.

186
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,416
When I made contact
with the Ball,

187
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,708
I flooded it with
my own life force

188
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,291
and transformed the negative
energy into positive energy.

189
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,791
When I kicked it away,
it was no longer your weapon.

190
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,041
It was my weapon!

191
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,833
You! You're despicable!

192
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,333
Are you saying that you
changed the Karma Ball

193
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,458
into positive energy and
used my own weapon to destroy

194
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,041
the negative energy that
was covering the Earth?!

195
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,541
Hey! Check out
the big brain on Omega!

196
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,291
I couldn't have said
it better myself!

197
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,208
Rrrrgh! Why you...

198
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,916
There's only one
thing left undone!

199
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,958
Big Bang Kamehameha!!

200
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,583
[OMEGA yells]

201
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,041
[GOGETA grunts]

202
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,416
The Dragon Balls!
They did it, yeah!

203
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,750
Thank goodness!

204
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,833
No! Please! Not again!

205
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,166
I haven't dropped
dead yet, Saiyan!

206
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,208
Omega lives on!

207
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,083
That was an impressive feat!

208
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,083
But your power's been
severely crippled!

209
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,458
One more blast like that

210
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,250
and you're history and
you know it, dragon!

211
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,500
Big Bang...

212
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,000
Ka... Me... Ha...

213
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,333
I'm me! We're us again!

214
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,375
Surely a half an hour hasn't
passed yet, has it?!

215
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,833
No! It's been ten minutes!
Fifteen minutes at the most!

216
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,041
What the heck happened,
Kakarot?!

217
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,416
Uh...

218
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,041
Oh, hey!
I know!

219
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,958
Since we're at Super Saiyan 4
we use a lot more power,

220
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,541
which means the length of time
we stay fused is shortened!

221
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,333
See! It all makes sense!
I knew there was an explanation!

222
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,666
You idiotic fool!

223
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,208
Shouldn't we have known
about that beforehand?!

224
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,416
Hey! It's not my fault!

225
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,875
I can't have
all the answers!

226
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,250
Darn! We were there!
Just one more blast!

227
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,375
[OMEGA laughs]

228
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,583
Too bad, you had me!

229
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,625
But fate has turned
the tables once again!

230
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,750
Now it's your turn
to face the terror!

231
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't be so sure!
Look at you!

232
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,583
You're hardly even
worth my time!

233
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,541
In your current state, I can
defeat you all by myself!

234
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,916
You both presume too much!

235
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,458
Shadow Dragons' Power...

236
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,583
...Unite!

237
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,708
Yes! That's it!

238
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,125
That's mine!

239
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,958
I like to keep
the four star ball

240
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,041
to remind me of my grandfather!

241
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,125
I won't let you
have this one, dragon!
