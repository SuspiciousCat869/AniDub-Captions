On the last GT,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,291
Goku, Pan, and Trunks arrived
at the Royal Palace of Imecka

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,083
like shadows in the night.

00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,500
Their mission:

5
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,875
To get their
impounded spaceship

6
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,125
back from the corrupt
regime of Lord Don Kee.

We're not sightseeing!

stealth was the
name of the game.

But their cover was blown
and the fireworks began.

I don't like it either, Pan.

It wouldn't be such a big
deal if we could just leave,

And that's what
makes it so difficult.

it illegal to own a ship.

different than ours,

321
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,291
but if he's
struggling to survive

322
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,291
then we have to respect that.

323
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,416
Poor little guy...
He's terrified.

324
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,166
And what are we going to
do about the Dragon Radar?

325
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,083
Huh?!

326
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,000
It looks like the Dragon
Radar is still intact!

327
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,875
If I'm right, he's integrated
the radar into his system

328
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,083
as a fully operational part.

329
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,166
[GIRU]
Affirmative!

330
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,541
All right!

331
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,791
Just great!

332
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,208
If the radar is
part of him now,

333
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,375
that means we have to
take him along with us!

334
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,000
Great!

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,416
[TRUNKS]
Hey, it's working!

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,333
He's giving us the location
of our first Dragon Ball!

337
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,958
[PAN]
Is it here on Imecka?

338
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,333
[TRUNKS] No, these coordinates
are for somewhere

339
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,625
in outer space,
but it's not that far from here!

340
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,125
[PAN] Well, what are we doing
just standing here?

341
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,291
[GOKU] Yeah!
Our first Dragon Ball!

342
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,250
[PAN]
Let's go get it!

343
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,583
[NARRATOR] After their seemingly
ill-fated crash landing,

344
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:41,041
the three space voyagers
are on their way once again.

345
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,875
The Imeckians have been
delivered from bondage,

346
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,375
but the future of Earth
is still in the balance.

347
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:50,916
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next Dragon Ball GT!
