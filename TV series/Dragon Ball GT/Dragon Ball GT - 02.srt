1
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,291
Now... rise...!

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,250
Shenron!

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:24,041
[NARRATOR] On the first
episode of Dragon Ball GT,

4
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,166
an elderly Emperor
Pilaf and his gang,

5
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,000
showed up uninvited on
top of the Lookout!

6
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,208
[NARRATOR]
Shenron was summoned,

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,500
but the Emperor's lack
of attention to detail

8
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,375
caused a most unusual
wish to be granted,

9
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,833
and Goku's body was reduced
to that of a ten year old.

10
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,541
What?! Goku!

11
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,791
The room got a lot bigger.

12
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,333
[GOKU] I had no idea
that the dragon was

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,625
there when I walked in,

14
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,500
then Pilaf made the
wish and "poof" here I am.

15
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,000
No, I liked being old...

16
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,791
[NARRATOR] Although Goku's
new look took some adjustment

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,000
from his family,

18
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,666
the situation seemed
to be under control...

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,125
[CHICHI]
Goku!

20
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,041
[NARATOR]...until
King Kai delivered

21
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,750
some even more alarming news.

22
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,000
[KING KAI] Goku!
Can you hear me?

23
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,166
We sure can, King Kai.

24
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,791
Now that a wish has been made,

25
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,750
the Earth is in
danger of exploding

26
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,083
unless all of the Black Star
Dragon Balls are found

27
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,041
and returned to Earth
within one year!

28
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,458
[gasps]

29
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,000
[cars honking in traffic]

30
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,458
[EMPLOYEES] Good morning,
Mr. President!

31
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,000
Hello, this is accounting...

32
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,208
I'm trusting that this
morning's meeting

33
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,791
went by the numbers, sir.

34
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,958
That was the easiest
deal I've ever closed.

35
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,208
They signed the contract

36
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,625
before I even finished
my first cup of coffee.

37
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,500
You were born to
lead this company, sir!

38
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,833
[TRUNKS]
If you say so...

39
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,291
Hey, he's here! Look!

40
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,958
It's him!

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,041
He always looks so... adorable!

42
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,583
[GREEN SUIT] This must be 
real exciting for you, sir.

43
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,625
[LADY] No challenge is too big
for you, Mr. Briefs.

44
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,875
[GREEN SUIT] Don't forget that
we have a board meeting

45
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,500
at three o'clock today.

46
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,791
[EXECUTIVE] Mr. Henderson
called wanting to

47
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,541
schedule a golf match
with you tomorrow.

48
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,333
[GREEN SUIT] And we
still haven't heard your

49
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,416
final decision on that
matter of the research budget.

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,166
[EXECUTIVE] Yes, if we are going
to approve anything,

51
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,583
it should be done fast.

52
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,375
[EXECUTIVE]
How about we go over this now?

53
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,708
[EXECUTIVE]
And of course,

54
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,291
there is the matter of
the third quarter budget,

55
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,708
which is something we need to
finalize before we discuss

56
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,125
the annual employee bonus pay--

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,750
I'll ride to my office alone.

58
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,375
Uh, but Sir...

59
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,666
[bell rings]

60
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,416
Yeah... Come in.

61
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,083
[EMPLOYEE] Excuse me, sir,
all of these documents

62
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,375
need your approval.

63
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,333
If I don't get this
to legal by two o'clock,

64
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,541
we'll miss all of
our deadlines!

65
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,958
You've got to be kidding me!

66
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,416
[EMPLOYEE]
Uh, no, I'm afraid not...

67
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,750
Okay, let's go over the
schedule one more time.

68
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,583
At two o'clock in your office,

69
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,458
the vice president wants to
discuss the new contract.

70
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,333
Two thirty is your
video conference call

71
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,500
to the investors from
the MechaVoid Corporation.

72
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,583
At three o'clock the
conference room is reserved

73
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,166
for the board of directors.

74
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,916
[ASSISTANT] We will be serving
coffee with your choice

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,833
of bagel or muffin.

76
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,250
Don't forget--

77
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,583
Why do I even try?

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,791
[TRUNKS]
Oh, yeah!

79
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,833
That was just about as much fun
as I could stand for one day!

80
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,958
[GOTEN]
I mean,

81
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,500
if you're not already doing
something tonight, that is...

82
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:56,541
Oh... really?!
Yeah, I'm excited, too.

83
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,541
You are one smooth
talker, Uncle Goten.

84
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,625
That's for sure.

85
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,333
Shhh...! Not you! No.

86
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,958
[PAN] If you don't
want me to poke fun,

87
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,208
then keep your voice down.

88
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,833
Do you mind?! I'm trying
to talk on the phone!

89
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,208
It's a mobile phone!

90
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,916
--Uh, hello? 
--No...

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry!... You see my
little niece was in the room...

92
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,583
[GOTEN]
But, hey listen...

93
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,541
How about I pick you
up around eight?

94
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,166
[PAN]
I am not little!

95
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,791
It's no big deal, really.

96
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,291
Tomorrow, Goku can take
Bulma's new ship into space.

97
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,250
Yeah.

98
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,666
It's not like this is the
first time you've gone

99
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,791
Dragon Ball hunting
to save the Earth.

100
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,791
You don't mind going, do you?

101
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,708
Why do I have to
be the one to go?

102
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,375
What do you mean "why"?

103
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,208
You've never balked at this
kind of adventure before!

104
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,416
Yeah, I guess
I'm just a little tired.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,375
Getting shrunk down to
the size of a kid again

106
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,500
really takes it out of me.

107
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,125
But... You have
to go on this trip

108
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,625
or the Earth will be
destroyed in a year.

109
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,000
She's right...

110
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,166
And we just finished the
addition to our house, Goku,

111
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,625
which I do not want to lose.

112
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:02,083
Yeah, Dad... We could never let
anything bad happen to Earth.

113
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,750
That's why...
I've come to a decision.

114
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,666
I'm going to find
the Dragon Balls with you.

115
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,833
That's great! A father
and son bonding trip!

116
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,541
Papa, you're going?

117
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,875
Uh-huh.

118
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,416
Let me go, Papa! I want to
go into space with you!

119
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,250
[CHICHI] Pan, your
father and grandfather

120
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,250
aren't going just to play,
you know? It'll be dangerous.

121
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,833
That's right, Pan.

122
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,041
I know that. I'm just offering
my help to save the Earth!

123
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,000
If you go up into space, you'll
see scary monsters and aliens

124
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,083
that will try and get you!

125
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,041
I'm not afraid of anything.

126
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,291
Pan... you sleep
with a night-light.

127
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,958
Um...

128
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,416
Sorry Pan, but going to
space is just for adults.

129
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,958
I'm taller than you, Grandpa!

130
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,166
[GOKU] That thing looks
like an octopus!

131
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,916
And it's so big!

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,291
[BULMA] This ship carries three
people, comfortably.

133
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,166
But with you being as
small as you are now...

134
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,125
It shouldn't be cramped at all.

135
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,583
You know, seeing you like this

136
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,916
reminds me of
the time we first met.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,333
[laughs]

138
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,083
Uh... hey boss!
I think someone's coming!

139
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,333
[CRIMINAL]
Can you tell who it is?

140
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,541
Well, uh, let's see... He's
got tall spiky black hair,

141
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,958
a widow's peak
and a creepy little mustache.

142
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,458
[CRIMINAL]
You numbskull!

143
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,916
You're supposed to be looking
out for Bulma's daughter!

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,625
Not describing every
guy that just walks by!

145
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,833
How else are we going to get the
ransom money from Capsule Corp!

00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,250
[KNEELING CRIMINAL]
Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!

147
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,750
It won't happen again, sir!

148
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,083
[PAN] Hey, Papa, is there
anything I can help you with?

149
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,875
[GOHAN]
Thanks Pan, but...

150
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,333
Uh... I think Bulma and I

151
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,750
have everything pretty
much under control.

152
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,125
Oh... Can I still help?

153
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,083
Why don't you go see if you can
help mom with something...

154
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:05,791
Alright?

155
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,666
[PAN]
Alright...

156
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,125
Hi, mama! Papa told me
I should come help you!

157
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,333
Thanks but... not
right now, honey.

158
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,708
I really have to finish

[VEGETA]
Dating is for the weak!

316
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,208
What about me? I am the
president of Capsule Corp!

317
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,791
Then consider
this a hostile takeover.

318
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,291
It's not that I don't want
to find the Dragon Balls,

319
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,916
I just know that my mother

320
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,791
would never let me set
foot on a spaceship.

321
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,291
It was all her idea.

322
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,583
[GOTEN]
You're kidding me!

323
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,666
Main power link...

324
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,125
Check!

325
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,625
[BULMA]
All systems are go for launch.

326
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,708
Hey, Goku! Keep those
two boys out of trouble!

327
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't worry, ChiChi... I will.

328
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:30,333
Oh, man... this isn't the kind
of vacation I had in mind.

329
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,333
[phone rings]

330
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,708
Hey, Valese, did ya get
my message? No, I swear.

331
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,291
I really am going
into outer space.

332
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,708
Gohan, sweetie...
have you seen Pan?

333
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,875
Yeah, I think she's
with Bulla somewhere.

334
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:48,333
No, Bulla's standing
up there with her dad.

335
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,291
Yeah... I know...
It sounds like baloney,

336
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,083
but I'm not making it
up! It's the truth.

337
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,500
[GOTEN] What?!
Look, I can barely hear you!

338
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,125
If you're gonna yell at me,
you're gonna have to be louder!

339
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,791
Whoa... Wow...

340
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,125
[TRUNKS] So, this is what's
supposed to pass

341
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,291
as our home for the next year?

342
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,000
[GOKU] Is that
the kitchen over there?!

343
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,583
[TRUNKS] No, Goku.
That's the control room.

344
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,708
Hi!

345
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,958
Hi, there Pan!

346
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,541
What's going on?

347
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,208
[PAN] Just making sure that all
systems are go for our journey!

348
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,708
'Bout time you guys got here.

349
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,750
Pan, please... this is no
time for fooling around.

350
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,666
Oh, no? Then let's get
serious! Blast off!

351
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,000
[scream]

352
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,000
What?! Yes! For a whole year!

353
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,708
You still there?
Good... Guess what?

354
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:06,000
Change of plans...
My schedule cleared up.

355
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,500
[NARRATOR] A most unusual
trio has begun their journey

356
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,291
to the far reaches
of the universe.

357
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,708
What will these three discover

358
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,875
in their effort to find
the Black Star Dragon Balls

359
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,750
and save the Earth
from certain doom?

360
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,166
[clink]

361
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:51,208
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball GT!
