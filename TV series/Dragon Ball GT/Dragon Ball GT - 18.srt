Hey, uhh! What happened? Where
did the guys I was fighting go?

[MEGA-NEZI]
We have combined to form

one being of
unparalleled military might!

The all-powerful

I, too, am excited!

00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,000
[MEGA-NEZI]
Pesky, little fly!

174
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,416
One wrong move and the

[GOKU chuckling] Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea to unite!

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,416
You have gotten stronger,
that's for sure!

186
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,416
But you're lacking in
the speed department!

Huh? Now what
are you laughing at?

[MEGA-NEZI] At the silly prattle
of a child who thinks he's fast,

but is about to have
a rude awakening!

Super Sigma
Aerial Attack! Engage!

00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,958
Look at that! He changed again.

[GOKU yelps]

194
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,250
All right! Now he's cookin'!

Ow... That hurt!

[MEGA-NEZI]
Flesh and bone creatures!

So fragile and inferior!

Allow me to take the pain
away once and for all!

Being on the ground

Just the tip of the iceberg!

I can reach levels a hundred
times greater than that!

[MEGA-NEZI]
Come now! You're bluffing!

231
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,875
You expect me to believe that
you've been hiding your power?

232
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,500
What would you gain
from holding back?

kind you had on me
