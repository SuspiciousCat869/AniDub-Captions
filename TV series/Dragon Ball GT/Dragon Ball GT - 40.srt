00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,333
Vegeta's body was shrinking so
Baby decided to abandon ship!

3
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,125
The parasite was
making his escape

4
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,458
and heading deep into space!

5
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,916
But Goku had the evil
Tuffle in his sights!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,416
[SS4 GOKU]
Me... Ha... Me... Ha!

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,625
[NARRATOR]
Goku's beam found its mark,

8
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,125
and the threat of Baby
disappeared forever!

9
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,583
Like from a giant
fountain above,

10
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,125
the Sacred Water flowed
down on the Earth and

11
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,708
liberated its people
from the foul hatchlings

12
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,750
nesting in their bodies.

13
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,875
[KRILLIN]
How did I get here?

14
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,250
[NARRATOR]
Free at last, it seemed like

15
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,916
the nightmare was over! But
more danger lay just ahead.

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,541
[GOKU]
What? But we brought

17
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,791
the Black Star balls back to
Earth, Mister Popo! Remember?

18
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,500
[NARRATOR] Almost a year
has passed since Baby used

19
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,666
the Black Star Dragon Balls to
wish for the new Tuffle planet.

20
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,291
Now, only two weeks remain
until the Earth explodes!

21
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,791
How can we get the
Dragon Balls in two weeks

22
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,291
when it took us a year before?

23
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,583
There's no way!

24
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,958
[PAN]
If everything went perfectly,

25
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,250
we might be able to get
it done in six months!

26
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,000
But two weeks? It'd take
us that long to get one!

27
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,666
Yeah, you're right. We wouldn't
have a chance, would we?

28
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,583
[PAN]
What are we gonna do, Grandpa?!

29
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,250
We can't just wait to die!

30
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,958
[PAN] I don't like
this! I'm scared!

31
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,333
[PEOPLE screaming]

32
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,708
[WOMAN A] Why are we
having so many earthquakes?

33
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,375
The Earthquakes are
getting bigger and bigger.

34
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,125
[VEGETA] This is all that
degenerate Baby's fault!

35
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,708
First he steals my
body and now this!

36
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,750
If he wasn't dead already,
I'd do the honors myself!

37
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,000
We need a plan!

38
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,000
[HERCULE whimpering]
I'm too young to die!

39
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
Gramps!

40
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,375
[TRUNKS] Goku! Our
communications network

41
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,458
is back on-line! We can talk
to the Tuffle Planet now!

42
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,583
Great!

43
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,666
Alright!

44
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,416
Hello! Are you just gonna
leave us up here or what?!

45
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,625
Hi, Bulma. You're
back to normal I see.

46
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,375
You all have a lot of explaining
to do! What's going on?

47
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,125
How did this planet get here?

48
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
[GOHAN]
Excuse me.

49
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
We've treated everyone here
with the Sacred Water, Dad,

50
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,083
and they're all back to normal!

51
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,541
You can send a ship up now,
we're ready for transport!

52
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,041
I wish I could, but I can't.

53
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,791
[CHI CHI]
How dare you!

54
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,375
Move it Gohan.

55
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,750
Goku! You're plotting something!
You don't want us to come back!

56
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,333
No! That's not it
at all! I promise!

57
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,041
[CHI CHI] I'm too old for
you now, is that it?

58
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,291
You've found a pretty young
girl your age, haven't you?

59
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,958
Chi Chi, you know
that's not true.

60
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,708
I just don't want you
coming back to Earth

61
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,500
because it's going to
blow up in two weeks.

62
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,958
What do you mean?

63
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,458
You brought the Dragon Balls
back to Earth a long time ago!

64
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,166
Yes that's true, but
Baby used them again.

65
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,416
And that was almost a whole
year ago. So, we failed.

66
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,541
What are we gonna do?

67
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,875
[VEGETA]
I can answer that! It's simple!

68
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,333
We migrate to planet Tuffle!

69
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,833
Of course!

70
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,208
We can just use Baby's base
of operations as our refuge!

71
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,083
Yeah, but how can we move
them all in two weeks?

72
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,541
[VEGETA] Kakarot, are you able
to do the Instant Transmission

73
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,541
in your current state?

74
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,666
No, but if I transform,
it'll be a cinch!

75
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,500
Super Saiyan Four will do it!

76
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,875
Super Saiyan Four
will do it, huh?

77
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,291
Go ahead Kakarot,
rub it in why don't you!

78
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,041
And Trunks, we'll need you too.

79
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,625
Can you get the big ship
fired up and ready to go?

80
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,083
Sure! No problem!

81
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,041
Okay Kakarot, that's our plan.

82
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,375
[VEGETA] We'll take as many
as we can on the spaceship,

83
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,416
but your going to have
to transport the rest.

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,125
Wow, Vegeta! You're
on a roll! Big time!

85
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,250
In the old days,
we got used to moving

86
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,916
from planet to planet
in large numbers!

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,291
Came with the trade!

88
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,916
[GOKU]
Even with Instant Transmission,

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,500
I won't be able to move all
of those people in time!

90
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,208
Can you help us, Kibito Kai?

91
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,250
[KIBITO]
I'd be happy to, Goku.

92
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,083
I think we're forgetting
about one thing though,

93
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,666
the people themselves.

94
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,083
They're skeptical. It will be
hard to convince them to leave.

95
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,333
You're right.

96
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,583
No one's going to believe that

97
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,708
the Earth is going to
blow up in two weeks.

98
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,625
That sounds crazy.

99
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,375
Yep. It's going to be pretty
hard for them to swallow.

100
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,541
[GOKU] Yeah, remember
when Vegeta asked them

101
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,250
to give me their
energy to beat Buu?

102
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,916
They wouldn't listen to
anyone but Mr. Satan!

Yes! That's it!

[HERCULE]
Me? Okay, I'll try.

106
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,000
[HERCULE]
In less than two weeks,

107
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,958
the Earth will no
longer be here!

108
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,416
It will be destroyed by
a cataclysmic explosion!

109
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
[MAN A]
How could that be possible?

110
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,625
[MAN B]
That's a bunch of bologna!

111
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,291
Some of you don't
believe what I'm saying!

112
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,250
And that's understandable!

113
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,250
But the Earth is
going to blow up

114
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,833
whether you believe it
or not! It can't be helped!

[TRUNKS] Look at that. They
flock to him like little sheep.

They all look up to him!

117

Ever since he defeated
Cell, they just love him!

118
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,458
Goku, don't tell me
you believe that story

119
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,083
about him beating Cell, too!

120
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,000
Gramps could be such a
great man... if he didn't lie.

To the planet that you
see above us in the sky!

My helpers will be wearing
badges like this one!

Please listen to them!

They will lead you and your
children to safe passage!

Gosh! What do you think?

129
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,833
Mr. Satan wouldn't steer us
wrong. I'm doing what he says.

Now everyone, grab
your neighbor's hand!

You'll have to grab someone
else's. Mine are taken.

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,625
it was still like living
with a little child.

315
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,041
[GOKU]
Gohan?

316
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,500
I miss him, Dad.

317
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,083
[KRILLIN]
Goku! Gohan! Hey! We're here!

318
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,208
[ROSHI]
Let's party!

319
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:40,750
[GOKU] Hi, everyone!
Come on in! Let's eat!

320
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,083
[NARRATOR] At last it was
a time for celebration!

321
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,625
Baby's nightmarish reign had
all but faded from memory,

322
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,833
and things on Earth were
back to normal once again!

323
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,958
Or were they?
