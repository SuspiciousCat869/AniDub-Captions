[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT...

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,708
it was Super Saiyan
verses Super Android

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,041
as Goku fought 17
in a battle that would

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,583
decide the fate of the Earth
and the Galaxy beyond!

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Goku powered up to
Super Saiyan Four

8
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,791
to deal with
the Android threat.

9
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,583
But Super 17 seemed immune to
every attack thrown at him.

10
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,250
Goku realized too late

11
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,166
that 17 was actually 
absorbing the attacks.

12
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,833
And using that power
against the Saiyans.

13
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:52,541
The epic battle
concludes today on GT.

Heh, heh! That wasn't too smart!

provided me the perfect cover!

long as I have you in this hold!

At one time you were
programmed to destroy Goku,

but you never took pleasure
in killing innocent people!

You even managed to
overcome the programming!

and independent

to be controlled!

He's absorbing your power.
You can't beat him!

I understand!

But your energy blasts are
only making him stronger!

[GOKU] He's not absorbing the

164

That means he can be hit!

165
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,791
He must have to stay
in that one posture

166
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,500
for the absorption to work!

167

This is our chance!

I'm his twin sister.

How could he kill my

That wasn't really
your brother, Eighteen.

He was in there somewhere,

but 17 wasn't the one
calling the shots.

They were controlling
him somehow.

But, you know, I think he
was trying hard to help you.

Huh?

There was no need to
start powering up.

205

All he had to do was keep
absorbing your energy!

Yes! I sensed him then!

207

his weakness was! Wasn't he?

never turned on Doctor Myuu.
