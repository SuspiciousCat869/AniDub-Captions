1
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,458
[MAI] I don't know what's
going on, but it's madness

2
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,541
in there, sire! I'm telling you,
this isn't a good time.

3
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,291
[PILAF]
You clueless idiot!

4
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,000
There will never
be a better time.

5
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,166
It's the perfect diversion.

6
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,916
[blasts]

7
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,458
[DENDE] I know the Lookout is
designed for stuff like this,

8
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,125
but the cracking floor is
starting to make me nervous.

9
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,416
[SHU]
If they're gonna blow us up,

10
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,958
I'd rather go back to the base.

11
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
[PILAF]
No, you won't!

12
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,000
You'll proceed ahead with
your orders as <i>ordered</i> !

13
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,250
[PILAF] Now both of you, pull!
Get us over that edge!

14
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,916
[struggling]

15
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,666
[MR. POPO] The floor does
seem to look a little unstable.

16
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,208
[DENDE] Maybe we
should get out of here!

17
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,416
[PILAF] Finally, I did it! Now,
everyone, to the Dragon Balls!

18
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,083
[explosion]

19
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,750
[PILAF]
Am I bleeding?

20
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,000
[MAI]
I think you'll be fine.

21
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,500
[SHU]
I can't see you, sire.

22
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,541
[PILAF] Well,
something hurts pretty bad.

23
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,458
Thanks to decades of

24
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,625
gut-wrenching
perseverance and research,

25
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,083
this is the last pain I'll feel

26
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,166
in searching
for the Dragon Balls.

27
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
[PILAF] By day's end,
my reckoning will be at hand

28
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,333
and all of humanity will
know the name Emperor Pilaf.

29
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,708
It'll be synonymous
with fear and rage...

30
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,958
...and with power and strength!

31
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,208
The world will know me as
King... King Emperor Pilaf!

32
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,083
[GOKU]
We're finished, Dende.

33
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,583
Well... Don't keep us
in suspense. How'd Uub do?

34
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,916
He passed with flying colors.
I was really impressed.

35
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
I have to admit, though,

36
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,458
I haven't had a battle that wore
me out this much since Frieza.

37
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,416
How does it feel
to graduate, Uub?

38
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,708
Really good.

39
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,750
Uub, are you okay?

40
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,791
[crash]

41
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,791
Popo, get the first aid kit!

42
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,083
[maniacal laughter]

43
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,041
[PILAF]
I've found them!

44
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,208
At long last, I found them!

45
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,833
They don't look like any
Dragon Balls I've ever seen.

46
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,291
Oh, they don't, huh?

47
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,625
Well, feast your eyes on this!

48
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,333
The star is black?

49
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,125
[PILAF] That's right. These are
the Black Star Dragon Balls.

50
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,791
They were made long ago before
Kami separated from Piccolo.

51
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,416
And I know this because
I am a brilliant researcher

52
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,875
and an unrivaled mastermind...

53
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,916
with a special knack
for devious behavior.

54
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,500
[coughing]

55
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,625
Awesome... aren't they?

56
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,000
Aren't they?!

57
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,541
Uh... what now?

58
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,166
You idiot!!

59
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,708
[crash] 

60
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,416
Oh, sire!

61
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,791
Emperor Pilaf!

62
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,041
You boneheads...

63
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,291
What's awesome
is that these balls

64
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,958
are twice as strong
as the other ones

65
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,166
because they were made when
Kami and Piccolo were still one.

66
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,208
Just like I told you
not ten seconds ago.

67
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,291
[MAI]
So, if these are stronger,

68
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,833
do they grant more
than one wish?

69
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,375
Or do they give you more
with each wish, like a bonus?

70
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,875
'Cause if all you get's a
stronger wish, then I'd--

71
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,250
Give it!

72
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,083
The wish is mine to make.

73
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,166
[PILAF] I order you to pick
the other Dragon Balls

74
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,291
out of those
skeletons immediately!

75
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,750
[MAI]
Yes, Emperor.

76
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,708
[GOKU] I hope you're as proud of
yourself as we are, Uub.

77
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,041
You certainly have earned it.

78
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,375
Thanks for everything you guys,

79
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,583
I just hate to leave
the Lookout like this.

80
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,041
[DENDE] Don't worry about it,
Uub. It's been a lot worse.

81
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,083
Mr. Popo and I can fix it
right up... Really... Besides...

82
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,291
You need to get back to your
family. I'm sure they miss you.

83
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,541
[UUB]
Thanks, Dende. Well, Goku,

84
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,791
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate everything.

85
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,583
[UUB]
You've changed my life.

86
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,041
[GOKU] Hey, don't thank me.
I got just as much out of it

87
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,208
as you did.

88
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,333
Really?

89
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,958
Yeah... you're a great teacher.

90
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,875
[UUB] That's funny, Goku. I'll
see you fellas later. Take care!

91
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,625
All we have ever worked for
has culminated in this moment.

92
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,375
Such a happy day. I don't know
what the word culminate means,

93
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,416
but I do know that I'm glad
you guys brought me along.

94
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,083
[sobbing]

95
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,041
[MAI]
Excuse me, guys...

96
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,125
But I've noticed that every time
we're on the brink of success,

97
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,375
something inevitably happens
to keep us away from it.

98
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,833
So what do you say
we hurry up with this!

99
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,958
Yeah, right... Of course.

100
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,250
Ahh...
That's what I call a meal!

101
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,250
[GOKU] When's the second
course gonna be ready?

102
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,083
Second... course?

103
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,500
And now...

104
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:31,583
Rise! Rise, Shenron!!

105
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,416
[hysterical panting]

106
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, I better get going.

107
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,375
[GOKU] I haven't been
home in a few years

108
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,375
and I'm betting my wife
won't be too happy with me.

109
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,416
[hysterical panting]

110
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,208
[SHENRON]
Why have you summoned me?

111
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,416
[GOKU]
Hey, what's going on in there?

112
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:23,875
[terrified gasps]

113
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,583
Who's there?

114
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,208
[screams]

115
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,291
It's him!

116
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,041
Hey, I know you guys, don't I?

117
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,625
[GOKU] I can't place it,
but you look familiar.

118
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,541
Do... you know me?

119
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,541
[nervous groans]

120
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,625
[GOKU] What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

121
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,166
Hey, Shu? Who is that?

122
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,000
It's that little kid
Goku all grown up.

123
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,500
You mean the Goku?!

124
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,375
You're saying that guy
is the little brat

125
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,250
who always put himself
between me and my greatness?!

126
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,500
Only now, he's grown up.

127
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,333
And he's got a body
that looks like

128
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,833
it was chiseled out of marble.

129
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,750
Yeah, I remember you now.
You're Emperor Pilaf, right?

130
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,791
Uh, you must have me
confused with somebody else.

131
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,500
[attempts casual whistle]

132
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,958
No, you're
Emperor Pilaf all right...

133
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,000
I'd have a hard time forgetting
blue skin and pointy ears.

134
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,000
Shu! Mai! Annihilate him!

135
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,625
All these years, and the three
of you are still up to no good.

136
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,333
[frustrated groan]

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,375
[PILAF]
Oh, yeah?!

138
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,666
Well, you've grown
from a little nuisance

139
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,625
into an even bigger one!

140
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,708
Well, you're the bad guys.

141
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm supposed to
stop your evil plans.

142
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,625
Get away from me!
You're three times my size!

143
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,000
I wish you were
a little kid again,

144
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,000
then I could really
teach you a lesson or two!

145
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,041
[SHENRON]
So be it.

146
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,125
[confused groan]

147
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,708
[panting]

148
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,500
What? Goku!

149
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,083
Wow, the room got
a lot bigger somehow.

150
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,791
Goku?

151
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,625
[SHENRON]
Your wish has been granted.

152
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,333
[SHENRON]
Until the next summoning...

153
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,833
Wait...
Don't go, dragon... Please.

154
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,541
So...uh... Do I have to
go back to school now?

155
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:26,583
Oh, no!! A wish was made on
the Black Star Dragon Balls!

156
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,041
[DENDE]
That's what I'm saying!

157
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,333
[KING KAI]
It's amazing to me that

158
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,458
they have survived
this long up there.

They must have been put in that
mausoleum a really long time ago

because none of us ever
knew they were there.

Goku, listen!

162

As horrible as this news is,
I hope you'll take it lightly

as long as it comes
from a friend.

164
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,083
The only way you 
can return to normal

165
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
is if you gather the
Black Star Dragon Balls

166
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,958
and make another wish!

167
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,708
No biggie, King Kai.
I'll find the Dragon Balls.

168
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,458
Besides, being a kid again for
a while might be kind of fun.

It's not that simple.

170
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,083
[MR. POPO] After a wish is made
on the Black Star Dragon Balls,

171
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,291
they aren't just
scattered across the earth.

172
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,750
They're scattered
throughout the entire galaxy.

173
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,500
They could be on any planet,
anywhere in the Milky Way.

[MR. POPO] It could
take forever to find them.

[KING KAI] What Mr. Popo
says is correct, Goku.

176
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,583
Oh, well...

177
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,166
I guess I'll just have
to stay like this then.

178
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,750

314
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,875
[GOHAN] So they caught
you off guard, huh?

315
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,875
I had no idea that the dragon
was there when I walked in.

316
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,208
Then Pilaf made the
wish and poof! Here I am.

317
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,875
And now I have
a pint sized grandpa

318
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,041
who looks like he should
still be in diapers.

319
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,708
I was already aging
faster than him as it was,

320
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,875
but this... it's unnatural!

321
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,916
I bet you did this on purpose!

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,666
No, I liked being old.
Really, I did.

323
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,208
Dad... Let's think here...

324
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,833
The Dragon Balls are spread
across the entire galaxy, right?

325
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,083
[GOKU] Uh-huh.
That's what Mr. Popo said.

326
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,416
[crying]

327
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
If that's the case,
it might be easier for you

328
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,583
to just grow up
like any other child.

329
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,166
Can you imagine someone my age
married to someone like this?!

330
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,083
[crying]

331
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,375
[KING KAI] Goku!
Can you hear me?

332
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,625
We sure can, King Kai.

333
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,041
[KING KAI] Good.
Then listen carefully...

334
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,125
[KING KAI]
I'm afraid I have bad news.

335
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,250
I've done some research
on the Black Star Dragon Balls,

336
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,958
and what I dug up
is quite unsettling.

337
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,250
Just how unsettling?

338
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,958
Now that a wish has been made,

339
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,791
the Earth is in
danger of exploding

340
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,083
unless all of the Black Star
Dragon Balls are found

341
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,625
and returned to Earth
within one year!

342
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,916
[KING KAI] You see,
when a wish has been made

343
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,041
using the Black
Star Dragon Balls,

344
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:14,000
the negative energy left behind
begins to take over the planet,

345
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:19,208
causing massive instability
and eventual self destruction.

346
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,333
What? King Kai,
you've got to be kidding!

347
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,208
You mean we have one year to
get the balls back or kaboom?!

348
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,041
That's exactly right.

349
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,708
[thunderclap]

350
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,875
[NARRATOR] With less than one
year to travel the universe

351
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,583
and gather the mysterious
Black Star Dragon Balls,

352
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:41,000
Goku and his friends stare
into an uncertain future.

353
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,583
Will the inadvertent wish
of a clumsy old foe

354
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,958
be the beginning of
the end for the planet Earth?

355
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,875
Find out as
the journey gets underway

356
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,333
on the next Dragon Ball GT!
