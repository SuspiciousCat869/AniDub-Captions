Listen all of you, please.

[KIBITO] You all know that for
every Yin, there is a Yang.

130
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,416
So even though you
used the Dragon Balls

131
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,708
for positive things,

132
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,000
negative energy was
introduced into the world.

133
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,458
It was stored inside
the Dragon Balls.

134
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,333
I had no idea.
But it makes sense.

135

I don't get it.

136
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
What happens to
the negative energy?

137
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,000
Does it just stay in
the Dragon Balls?

138
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,833
Hmm. I guess it's
just like anything else.

139
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,708
They would hold as much
energy as they could,

140
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,166
then, one day, when they
exceeded their capacity,

141
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,083
they would burst.

142
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,708
[KIBITO]
That's exactly right.

143
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
They can only hold so much.

144
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,125
The negative energy does
dissipate over time,

145
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,333
but for every wish,

146
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,958
it takes about 100 years
for that to happen.

147
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,291
[KIBITO] In truth, the
Dragon Balls were never meant

148
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,625
to be used more than
once every 100 years.

149
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,666
This allows time for
the negative energy

150
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,500
to seep out harmlessly,
as it was intended to do.

151
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,875
But the balls were used
much more often than that.

[SHENRON]
Your wish has been granted!

hold it any longer,

154
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,916

energy was released at once,

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,250
in the form of this dragon.

156
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,375

Many years ago,
I heard of an evil dragon

162
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,875
appearing on the Planet Eros.

163
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,166
Shortly after, Eros and
every star and planet

164
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,666
in its galaxy were destroyed.

165

Unbelievable.

166
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,875
That's why the Dragon Balls
are scattered after every wish!

167
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,333
It's supposed to take
centuries to find them

168
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,666
so the negative energy
can't have time to accumulate.

169

[OLD KAI] But then someone
invented the Dragon Radar

Well, why don't you just say it?

173

There were those that were
aware of the dangers of overuse,

174
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,208
but no decision was ever made
to warn the people of the Earth.

00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,875
[HAZE SHENRON coughing]

316
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,791
You creep! Do you know who
I am? You'll die for that!

317
00:21:51,833 --> 00:22:03,500
[HAZE SHENRON screaming]

318
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,000
Grandpa, tell me.

319
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,041
Is this the terrible,
evil dragon? Please say no.

320
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,708
Well, he's definitely
different than the one we saw.

321
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,875
What are you looking
at you little beasts?

322
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,625
Did you think a little foot
pain could hurt Haze Shenron?

323
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:25,000
[HAZE SHENRON cackling]

324
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,291
[NARRATOR] The Two-Star Dragon
has the power

325
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,833
to defile entire worlds
with his terrible pollution,

326
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,125
but does he have the
physical might needed

327
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,500
to tangle with Goku and Pan?

328
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,875
And if he doesn't,

329
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,000
does he have something else
planned for our heroes?

330
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:50,958
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball GT!
