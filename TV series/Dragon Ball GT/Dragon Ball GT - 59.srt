On the last GT,

5
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,666
a helpless, blinded,
and beaten Goku

6
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,333
was snatched out of
the jaws of death

7
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,166
by Goten in the nick of time!

8
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,375
Even though he had
lost his eyesight,

9
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,916
Goku was still
the only one

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,333
with a chance of
beating Syn Shenron!

11
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,375
So Majuub came to the fore,

12
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,750
hoping to hold off the
evil dragon long enough

13
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,208

You know, we're here because
we all have faith in you.

15

In a desparate move,
Goku took on even more energy

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,208
than the natural limits
of his body should allow!

Unable to see Syn Shenron,

19

Goku had to rely
on his other senses!

20
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,208
But he still managed
to score a direct hit

One-Star Dragon!

This is my true form!

the pinnacle of dragon power!

00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,291
Vegeta!

165
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,125
[VEGETA] Don't be stupid!
It won't work!

166
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,333
You'll only succeed
in killing yourself

167
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,458
and then where will we be?

168
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,916
Vegeta!

169
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,916
It's about to get
intense, Kakarot.

170
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,416
No offense, but it's
been intense all along!

171
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,791
This dragon is in a league
of his own. You have no idea.

172
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,291
Yeah, I know he's great,

173
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,125
but is he strong enough to
take on two Super Saiyan 4's?

174
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,500
Two?

175
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,708
You heard me. I have a plan
to reach Super Saiyan 4.

176
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,875
[GOKU gasps]

177
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,166
[VEGETA thinkis]
Where is that woman?

178
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,625
How can she be late
at a time like this?

179
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,416
Ah, speak of the devil!

180
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,000
[GOKU] What in the world
is she driving?

181
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,041
[VEGETA]
Blutz Wave Emission equipment.

182
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,375
[GOKU]
Huh?

183
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,083
[VEGETA] What were
you doing? Taking a nap?

184
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,625
You've got some nerve!

185
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,625
It would take anyone else
years to build this, you jerk!

186
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,958
Why don't you pipe
down and get busy!

187
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,083
Super Saiyan 4 or not!
He doesn't scare me!

188
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,833
Not one bit!

189
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,958
Blutz Waves? What for?

190
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,750
[VEGETA yelling]

191
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,208
What's happening?

192
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,000
He's transforming!

193
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,166
Vegeta's turning
into a giant ape!

194
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,416
This could turn out bad.

195
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,416
[VEGETA roars]

196
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,000
Bulma, what are you doing?
Cut it out!

197
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,083
If Vegeta loses control, he
could blow up the entire planet!

198
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,166
Look! Our only
hope is for Vegeta

199
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,916
to become a Super Saiyan 4!

200
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,500
If Goku was able to do it,
he should be able to do it, too!

201
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,083
But there's no guarantee!
It's too risky!

202
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,666
It's sink or swim, Gohan!

203
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,708
If this doesn't work,
we'll all die anyway!

204
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,875
But...

205
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,250
Listen! Above all,
I'm Vegeta's Princess!

206
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,791
Bulma...

207
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,541
[VEGETA roars]

208
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,208
That's it, he's lost it!

209
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,291
Father!

210
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
[VEGETA roars]

211
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,708
What the...?!

212
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,166
This is trouble.

213
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,875
[VEGETA roars]

214
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,666
Vegeta, no! Please! It's me!

215
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,250
[GOKU yells]

216
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,625
[OMEGA chuckles]

217
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,166
So! Is this your
secret weapon?

218
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,458
A giant monkey too ignorant
to know who the enemy is?

219
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,250
Vegeta!

220
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,916
[VEGETA]
Ka... ka... rot...

221
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,708
I am the Prince of all Saiyans!

222
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,125
I could never allow my
reason to be overpowered

223
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,250
by the primal mind!

224
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,916
Awesome, Vegeta!
You're really something!

225
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,416
What?

226
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,208
[PAN] This is what Grandpa
did when he first transformed!

227
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,458
All right.
He's doing it!

228
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,625
That's it, dad!
Just a little bit further!

229
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
It's working! I knew it!

230
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,541
At long last, I've ascended.

231
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,291
Well done. You amaze me.

232
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,666
Wow! He's really cute!

233
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,375
Gosh, he's even better
looking than Goku!

234
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,500
Excuse me!
You're kidding, right?

235
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,666
Goku's far better looking!

236
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,833
What?! No way!
You're crazy!

237
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,125
I'm crazy?!
Well you're blind!

238
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,541
Ladies! Why squabble?

239
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,583
You're looking at the blue
ribbon face right here!

240
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,583
--Get over yourself!
--Get over yourself!

241
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,250
Uh, okay!

242
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,708
Quit stalling!

243
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,291
[OMEGA growls]

244
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,000
[BOTH yell]

245
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,583
Whoa! I gotta learn
how to do that.

246
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,791
It's almost as if the Earth is
quivering because it's scared!

247
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,125
Do you really think one more
weakling will make a difference?

248
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,916
Well, then. Shall we?

249
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:06,708
Kakarot, if we
attack now, we'll die.

250
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,625
Are you serious?

251
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,458
Search your feelings.
You know it as well as I.

252
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,166
It is true.

253
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,666
Well it wouldn't
be the first time,

254
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,500
but I have to
die again, I'm ready.

255
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,375
No, there's no need.
When there's Fusion!

256
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,041
You know I wouldn't suggest
joining bodies with you

257
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,208
unless it was
our only hope.

258
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,291
Our last hope.

259
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,791
[NARRATOR] After preventing
Goku from needlessly

260
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,958
sacrificing his own life,

261
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,750
Vegeta has come up
with a plan for victory!

262
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:53,375
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball GT!
