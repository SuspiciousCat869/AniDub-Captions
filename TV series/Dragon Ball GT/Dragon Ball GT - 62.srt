This Fusion of
yours won't happen!

[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT,

4
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,625
the only thing
that looked worse

5
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,125
than Goku and Vegeta's
dancing abilities

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,208
was their chance of winning

7
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,083
against the ferocious
Omega Shenron.

Whatd'ya know!
I'm a little kid again!

20
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,625
Now we're in a pickle!

21
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,958
[NARRATOR] Unable to pull
off the Fusion technique,

22
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,625
and with Goku reverted
to his younger self,

23
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,250
Omega Shenron seemed
an unbeatable foe.

24
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,083
[OMEGA] You realize
you're destined to die.

25
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,958
[NARRATOR] The bad omens
continued to reveal themselves

26
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,416
with the appearance
of a Dragon Ball

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,916
protruding from
Goku's forehead.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,750
What could this
mean for our hero?

29
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:56,583
Find out today
on Dragon Ball GT!

30
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,875
All right!
Let's get this over with!

31
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,000
Uh, I know I'm getting
old and my eyesight's going,

32
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,250
but does anyone else see

33
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,875
a Dragon Ball growing
out of Goku's forehead?

34
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,916
[HERCULE]
Good. So I'm not crazy.

35

[CHICHI crying]
I can't take it anymore!

36
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,125
He turns into a child,
he runs off on crazy adventures,

37
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,291
and now he has
a ball on his head!

38
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
Uh, Grandma?

39
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,083
She's finally cracked.

40
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,583
[GOKU] Are you just
going to stare at me

41
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,375
or are we going to fight?!

42
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,041
What are you saying you clown?

43
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,375
Look at yourself.

44
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,250
In that condition you
couldn't fight a headcold.

45
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,250
Just because I'm
in my younger form

46
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,375
doesn't mean I can't
put up a good fight.

47
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,125
You are so very
stupid sometimes!

48

Grandpa! Hey!

00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,791
Your forehead! Feel it.

50
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,375
My forehead?

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,291
Whoa! What's that?!

52
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,125
That's what we've
all been wondering.

53
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,166
Ahh! What is that thing?

54
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,916
It better be a pimple 'cause
I'm not going to the hospital!

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,291
I do not want to get a shot!

56
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,916
But it doesn't hurt!

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,791
He probably wouldn't have even
noticed if I hadn't told him.

[OMEGA chuckles]

59

For as insignificant
as you all are,

60
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,708
you've certainly kept
me entertained.

61
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,291
Unfortunately, it's time
I pulled the curtain

62
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,250
on your little comedy act.

63
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Right now!

64
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,250
I've had enough fun for one day!

Wait, Omega Shenron!

00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,625
Hey, Nuova Shenron!

I haven't had my fun yet.

68
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,041
I suppose I could share.

[OMEGA laughs]

00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,291
Think about what
you're doing, Nuova!

71
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,416
You know you can't
trust him, remember?

72
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,375
He's already killed you once!

73
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,583
He's just going to turn
on you like he did before!

74
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,500
All he knows is how to betray!

75
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,833
What did you expect?

76
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,708
Once I've absorbed
a Dragon Ball,

77
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,333
it is forever tainted
by my negative energy.

78
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,458
Your strategy of consuming one

79
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,333
was nothing but a foolish
display of ignorance.

80
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,250
I gave Nuova here a small
portion of my negative energy.

81
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,333
And combined with
his natural strength,

82
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,291
you won't last five seconds!

83
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,875
I promise.

84
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,500
And this time, Goku...

85
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,416
...I will not show pity.

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,083
Ha! I never asked
for it the first time.

87
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,708
If the three of you are going
to talk as if I don't matter,

88
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,083
then I'm afraid I'm going
to have to interrupt!

89
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,208
Be careful Vegeta!

90
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,791
Nuova Shenron's a lot
faster than we are!

Is that a fact?

putting that to the test!

I might suggest going in
the opposite direction, boy!

fighters as it is.

ahead and sit this one out

No one here is a good
enough challenge for me.

But by giving Nuova
enough Negative Energy,

115
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,083
this battle should prove to be

[OMEGA growls]

00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,958
What makes you think
I would come back here,

167
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,041
loyal only to you?

168
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,416
Loyal to the one who killed me.

169
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,208
I know how strong of a fighter
you are Omega Shenron.

170
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,041
That is why Goku and I
worked out this little plan.

171
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,666
We caught you off-guard and
you fell right into our trap.

172
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,375
Fool, for something so smart
you are behaving very stupidly.

173
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,208
I don't think so.

174
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,166
This time, I've thought
everything through.

175
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,416
These flames are moving in
a perfectly sealed sphere.

176
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,250
Your strength won't
make a bit of difference

177
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,291
if your body
can't take the heat.

178

It's your call.

179
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,875
What is it?

180
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,125
Would you like me to remove
the flame chains for you? 

181
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,500
That's right!
Go ahead and shoot!

182
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,625
You'll kill yourself
while you're at it.

Oh, I forgot!

184
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,625
You're not used to shooting
someone face-to-face.

185

How's this?
Do you feel better now?

Ha! Still don't have the guts?

187
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,875
Allow me to do it for you!

Wait! Think about
what you're doing!

He's right where we want him!
Don't hold back!

Are you actually willing to
risk your own life as well?

I am Nuova.
Heat is not a factor.

become charcoal is you!

that's left of them.

Hold up, Vegeta!

197
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,208
I sense someone inside there!

Who?

All right! It looks like
Nuova Shenron made it!

200
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,291
Nuova, you're okay!
The plan actually worked!

What's wrong? Are you okay?

202

I'm sorry, Goku.

It's not him!

No, it's Omega!

205
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,375
Then, what happened?

Surprised to see me, Goku?

You! Nuova!
What did you do to him?

208

Yes, I guess it is
a story worth sharing,

209
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,791
if you don't mind my bragging.

210

Are you prepared
to go down with me?

211
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,500
You see, while my body
absorbs the heat,

212
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,416
yours will be incinerated!

213
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,875
If your body comes
so highly recommended,

214
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,166
then maybe I could borrow it!

He was right I suppose.

lacked a certain artistic touch.

energy you have

dark and then cold.

At some point it will explode,

and the pollution will expand
outwards in all directions.

effect of destruction.

But then, that means
it could reach us here!

only a matter of time.
