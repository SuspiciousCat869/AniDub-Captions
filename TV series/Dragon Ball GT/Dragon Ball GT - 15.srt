00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,416
I hurried here to report that
those beings you discovered

161
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,541
are in possession
of a most amazing power.

162
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,916
If their power were
to be harnessed

163
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,416
and used to our benefit,

164
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,708
it would represent a force
far greater than that of Luud.

165
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,708
And I believe the
best means of doing so,

166
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,916
would be for me to use my
amazing powers of persuasion

167
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,875
to bring them over to
our side, and if we--

168
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,083
We require no more assistance
from you, Dolltaki.

169
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,125
General Rilldo.
Wh-why are you here?

170
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,833
I mean, where is Dr. Myuu?

171
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,083
That is no longer
of any concern to you.

172
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
[DOLLTAKI gasps] Well then,
I'll just be on my way.

Dr. Myuu did send you a message.

00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,208
Drop dead.

176
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,250
My assignment is now

I await your further orders.

the Dragon Ball from these boys.

And I wish for them to be
brought to me alive as well.

Do you understand?

184
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,875
They are in possession
of amazing power

185
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,666
that should be quite useful
to me in my research.

186
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,875
That is why they must
be brought to me alive.

187
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,041
I expect you to be a bit
more delicate than normal
