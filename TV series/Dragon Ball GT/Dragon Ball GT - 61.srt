the extra Dragon Balls

out of Omega's control,

10
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,958

to the form of Syn Shenron.

his lost power,

Dragon Balls once again.

rain on your parade,

00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,541
Hmm! Okay!

322
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
But you are aware that if you
let us go through with this,

323
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,166
you're most likely going to die?

324
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,625
Mm, hmm.

325
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,208
You heard the nice Dragon!
Let's serve up some Fusion!

326
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,833
Right!

327
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:15,708
FUSION! HA!

328
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,208
He's letting them do it.

329
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,708
[VEGETA and GOKU gasp]

330
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,250
Kakarot!

331
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,291
You're a... You're a...

332
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,333
Whatd'ya know!
I'm a little kid again!

333
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,875
Now we're in a pickle!

334
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,291
This is awful!
Grandpa's little again!

335
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,291
He must be out of power!

336
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,416
Well, your little dance
didn't work, did it?

337
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,708
You should have
known better than

338
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,583
to take on so many
of my attacks.

339
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,375
It was only a matter of
time until you puttered out.

340
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,416
Guess you could say you ran out
of gas right before the finish.

341
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,416
[GOKU laughs]

342
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:11,333
Hmm? How long before you
suffer the same fate, Vegeta?

343
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,541
You realize you're
destined to die.

344
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,083
Don't fool yourself, Dragon!

345
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,333
Nobody controls
my destiny but me!

346
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,125
I have to admit it,
you're strong,

347
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,791
stronger than anyone
that I've ever faced.

348
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,375
That's for sure!

349
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,666
But as long as there's
breath left in this body,

350
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,041
it's not over yet!

351
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,000
[NARRATOR] Just as Goku
made his fiery declaration,

352
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,541
the Four Star Dragon Ball
appeared on his forehead!

353
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,083
What does this
strange development mean?
