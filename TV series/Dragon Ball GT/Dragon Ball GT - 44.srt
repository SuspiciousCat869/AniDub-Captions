[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

3
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,750
Goku was tricked by Doctors Myuu
and Gero and trapped in Hell.

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,291
And it wasn't long
before a couple of Goku's

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,583
forgotten adversaries were
up to their old tricks!

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,708
Little did Goku know
that being trapped

7
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,416
in the one place evil
goes when it's destroyed

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,708
would only cause these
powerful fighters

9
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,416
to revive after every defeat.

10
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,625
Meanwhile, the battle on Earth
raged as the doctors' strategy

11
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,625
of a full attack
was put into motion!

12
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,333
But none of these
Saiyans would go

13
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,375
without a ground shaking fight.

The core temperature of our

reached it's optimum level.

If our victory is
to be decisive,

Is Android 17 trying to bring

Eighteen back to the side
from which she came?

22
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,375
Or is this simply another ploy

Android 18 is just that,

You destroyed Dr. Gero

You resented him so much because
he gave you human emotions.

that have to do with it?

their temperature is much colder

than someone who's alive.

95
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,583
And since Goku's not dead,

96
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,666
his high temperature
warms up the ice spirits

97
