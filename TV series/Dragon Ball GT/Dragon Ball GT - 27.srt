00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,875
[BABY GOTEN]
I'm fine. I'm going out.

161
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,375
[CHI CHI]
What are you talking about?

162
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,291
You're in no shape
to be running around.

163
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,458
You need to get some rest!

164
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,541
[BABY GOTEN]
I'm leaving.

165
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,958
[CHI CHI]
You can't go!

166
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,625
You need to rest, please...

167
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,083
Back off!

168
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,666
Goten!

[CHI CHI sobbing]

170
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Why are all of my
children delinquents?!

171
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,875
[BABY] Stay right where you
are, Saiyan. I'm on my way.

[BABY GOHAN]
Huh?

174
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Poor Tuffle. Running
into vengeance

175
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,916
without a day of 
training under your belt.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,250
[BABY GOHAN] The training
I present here is Gohan's.

177
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,083
It should be sufficient.

Well, well... His body moves
in a very interesting way.

184
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,916
It's very fluid, but
not without structure.

185
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,958
[BABY GOHAN] And its
destructive force is unrivaled.

186
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,958
I can finally
appease my ancestors.

187
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,333
We Tuffles have waited
centuries for this day.

188
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,583
The time has come to
steal your body, Vegeta!

189
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,708
Enough games!

190
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,250
You're nothing but a loser,
like your ancestors.

191
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,208
King Vegeta threw your
people out for one reason--

192
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,916
Because they were unworthy!

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,583
[BABY GOHAN cackling]

194
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,583
Your monkey brain really
doesn't understand.

195
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,250
Our fight is not a
question of what you think.

196
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,208
It's a simple 
matter of the math.

197
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,083
You're outnumbered, Vegeta.

198
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,125
Just because you're
inside a Saiyan body

199
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,875
doesn't mean I'm outnumbered.

200
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:31,500
Ha! But that means, to kill
one you must kill the other.

201
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,041
What a predicament.

202
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,833
If you raise your power high
enough to rid the world of evil,

203
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,625
you kill your
Saiyan friend's son.

204
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,750
[VEGETA]
And what makes you think

205
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,791
I have a problem with that?

Yes! That's it...

00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,250
That's him...
That's just like Vegeta.

211
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,291
Raising his power every step,
never wanting to be equaled.

212
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,458
[VEGETA] How do you plan
on finishing me off?

213
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,041
You've done such a
great job beating me down.

Hey, Vegeta!

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,333
I've come to the rescue!

217
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,375
[VEGETA] Don't butt in,
Goten. This is my catch.

218
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,583
You hear me?!

219
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,958
Wow. You're in a bad
mood today, aren't ya?

220
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,541
[GOTEN]
Wait.

221
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,333
You're not seriously going to
fight with my brother, are you?

222
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,666
We're brothers then.
Sounds about right.

223
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,875
Fly away, boy!

224
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,000
That's how it's gonna be!

225
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,625
I told you I was
coming to the rescue.

226
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,750
Sorry if you
thought I meant yours.

Give up now, Vegeta.

236
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,333
You're fighting two Saiyans
and we're brothers.

237
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,333
Neither your strength
nor your ego

238
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,833
can come close to this power.

239
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,166
A smart fighter would take
this chance and go home.

240

That's it, Vegeta. Get angry!

00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,666
Push all of that hatred you
have built up inside you

Where are you? Show your
face, you filthy coward!

252
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:23,125
[BABY] I'm everywhere you
are, now. Inside you.

253
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,708
You're where?!

254
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,083
You would probably
call me a parasite,

255
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,791
but it's far more
complicated than that.

256
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,250
You see, I also control
you... You're my puppet...

257
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,416
You became a Tuffle without
ever knowing a thing.

258
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,083
You think you can control
me, you disgusting--

259
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:49,458
[BABY] Oh, I do control you.
Go ahead, try to move your body.

260
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,791
This is destiny.

261
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,125
This is the revenge
the Tuffles have sought

262
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,166
from the Saiyans for so long.

263
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,791
[BABY] My ancestral home
planet was actually

264
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,458
a peaceful and wealthy society

265
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,625
with a highly developed
scientific community.

266
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,791
It was you barbaric,
evil Saiyans who destroyed it,

267
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,541
burning through our
planet's resources

268
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,875
like they were dry wheat.

269
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,125
So you were kicked off your
own planet by the Saiyans.

270
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,041
[BABY] The unrefined killer
instinct in the Saiyans

271
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,041
rose to a deafening pitch
as the Tuffles were slain

272
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,541
all over their own 
planet like insects.

273
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,291
And the being responsible
for this genocide was

274
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,375
none other than your
father, King Vegeta,

275
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,083
who, in his greatest
moment of arrogance,

276
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,083
renamed the planet
after himself.

277
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,833
Having been
pushed out of society,

278
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,500
we took what remaining
scientific knowledge we had

279
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,416
and used it to create 
a genetically superior

280
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,875
parasitic organism.

281
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,041
Then our King Tuffle
combined his own DNA

282
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,791
with the genes
of the parasites,

283
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,958
and scattered
his creation across

284
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,625
the vast reaches of space.

285
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:59,333
And now some of us have made
it back to exact our revenge.

286
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,625
[VEGETA] That's you, not me!
You cannot control me!

287
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,958
I won't let you!

288
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,708
[BABY]
Unfortunately, foolish one,

289
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,416
that is no longer an option.
Once I'm in your blood,

290
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,875
my cells spread
immediately to the brain

291
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,958
for better control.

292
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,541
Right, Goten?

293
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,416
Right.

294
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,666
And when they reach your brain,

295
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,458
[BABY] your body starts
trembling uncontrollably,

296
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
just like right now.

297
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,083
Soon, you'll
understand everything.

298
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,416
[VEGETA grunts]

299
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,208
[VEGETA] You monster! I'll
show you what a Saiyan can do--

300
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,250
Go ahead. Show us.

301
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,958
[BABY] Now that I have all
of the Saiyan power I need,

302
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,333
I will start to spread my cells

303
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,916
through every living
being on this planet.

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,541
And when I'm finished here,

305
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,250
I will move on to the
rest of the universe.

306
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,958
All the while with
you, your friends

307
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,000
and your family as
my puppet slaves!

308
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,250
[BABY] I've won the fight
with the bully of the galaxy.

309
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,041
My ancestors would be so proud.

310
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,375
Now, the son of the man
who killed my people

311
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,541
will forever be part of me.

312
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,166
My plan to make Tuffles
of this entire planet

313
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,250
is finally in place.

314
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,833
But Vegeta...

315
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,875
Since it was your father who
pushed my people to this...

316
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,291
...I'll make sure to 
kill you when I'm done.

317
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:42,375
[beeping]

318
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,791
Okay, guys, when we're
done, I need a jacket...

319
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,791
...or maybe a pelt.

320
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,541
Or maybe a microwave?
Put me on the stove.

321
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,708
[PAN] Where is it,
Giru?! If we don't hurry,

322
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,125
Grandpa's brain will freeze
right along with his body.

323
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:57,916
[GOKU yells]

324
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,791
[PAN]
Oh, no! Grandpa!

325
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:00,958
Goku!

326
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,333
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru!

327
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,333
Look what I found in the snow!

328
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,708
[BOTH laughing]

329
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,916
[PAN]
Yes!

330
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,291
[TRUNKS] You did it, Goku!
I can't believe it!

331
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,333
[GOKU]
Finally, we can go home!

332
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,833
And the first
thing I'm gonna do

333
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,500
is have some of Chi-Chi's
best homemade noodles!

334
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,625
Oh-yeah!

335
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,000
[NARRATOR]
Little do our heroes know that

336
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,250
while they plan a
glorious homecoming,

337
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,333
their near-forgotten enemy,
Baby has already initiated

338
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,791
his plan to turn all of
planet earth into Tuffles.

339
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,250
Will these three
find their way home

340
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,208
in time to save it from an
entirely different threat?

341
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,208
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball GT!
