A legendary Super-Saiyan

165
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,500
actually right here
in front of me!

166
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,250
This is one of the days that
makes life worth living!

167
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:57,125
[DR. MYUU laughs maniacally]

168
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,250
I'm quite excited, Trunks.

169
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,541
I can't wait to get
a good look at your data.

170
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:15,333
You see Trunks, it's your Super
Saiyan ferocity that I admire.

171
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,416
And I bet that ferocity
is boiling right now.

172
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,250
It's a good thing
we have you contained.

173
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,583
Soon, the time to release

174
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,000
your full Saiyan power
will be at hand.

175
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,166
General Rilldo
should be delivering

176
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,083
your two other Saiyan
friends any time now.

177
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,875
Registering... 
There they are! Get them!

178
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,250
Go...

179
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,166
[PAN] What is wrong
with your dumb robots?!

180
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,041
Look how crowded
it is in here!

181
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,250
If you don't get off this
elevator right now--

182
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,875
Ouch, that hurts!
Stop it! Cut it out!

183
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,500
This is so annoying!

184
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,416
Get off me! Let go!
What's that smell?

185
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,166
Ouch!

186
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,458
Giru! You dirty traitor!

187
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,916
Get over here, I've got
a bone to pick with you!

188
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,666
I knew you had
some rotten wiring

189
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,708
the moment we found
you in the desert!

190
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,833
From the second you
swallowed the Dragon Radar,

191
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,458
you've been nothing
but bad luck!

192
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,541
All those times we had
to defend ourselves,

193
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,416
you never helped!

194
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,833
After all, you're the one who
said to come here. Didn't you?!

195
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,500
Wait!

196
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,041
You rescued us just so
you could bring us here!

197
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,375
You used yourself as bait!

198
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,833
All you ever wanted

199
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,791
was to put us in the hands
of that Dr. Myuu guy, right?

200
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,833
Giru.

201
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:55,208
Warning! Warning!
Warning! Warning!

202
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,125
Giru!

203
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,583
Giru, you better be ready
for me when I get back!

204
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,250

Warning! Warning! Warning!

210
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,833
Miss Pan, I've deactivated
the removal system!

211
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,041
[PAN] You work pretty
well under pressure.

212
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,416
Ya' know ya' could've
done that earlier.

213
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,875
The chase ends here,
double-crosser.

214
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,791
So why don't you just give
us back the Dragon Balls?

215
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,041
Without them there's no way

216
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,458
to stop the earth
from being destroyed.

217
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:04,500
Giru, Giru. Giru not know,
Danger, danger! Giru, Giru...

218
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,541
You know the emergency
removal system

219
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,625
has been deactivated,
don't you?

220
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,291
Giru, Giru, Giru!
Giru know nothing!

221
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,916
That's okay. 'Cause I gotcha!

222
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
Giru!

223
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,083
No you don't! You're not
getting away this time!

224
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:25,000
[PAN growls]

225
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,583
Then I'll use a Kamehameha Wave!

226
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,750
Giru, you have so
picked the wrong day

227
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,541
to try and mess with me!

228
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay, you asked for it. Ka...

229
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,041
Me...

230
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,625
Ha...

231
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,875

Huh? What?

234
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,416
I thought we stopped this!

00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,708

Pan.

I wish I was back
at home right now.

238
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,625
Having homework is better
than dealing with this.

239
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,750
That looks like a Dragon Ball!

240
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,833
It is a Dragon Ball!

241
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,625
[PAN cheers]

242
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,791
And I found it!

243
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,458
Or did it find me?

244
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,208
Gotcha!

life, Super Saiyan!

[GOKU growls]

You've got abilities,

249
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,208
but you don't know
how to use them right.

250
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,708
If I were judging you off
appearance, I'd call you a liar.

251
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,375
And it seems that
you've already forgotten

252
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,541
the most important
point of all.

253
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,791
You can fight me all you want,

254
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,375
but until you rid this planet
of all the metal covering it,

255
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,291
I will always have a body
to bring to the battle.

256
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,416
Now, if you don't know, this
is the part where you concede

257
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,750
and make the smart
decision to hand yourself

258
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,166
and the other Saiyan
over to Dr. Myuu.

259

[NARRATOR] General Rilldo
divulged the secret

260
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,750
of his awesome power, making
him even closer to invincible.

261
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,958
Can Goku find 
some way to destroy

262
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,041
all of the metal on the planet?

263
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750
And with the three Dragon Balls

264
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,250
that mysteriously
appeared next to her,

265
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,375
will Pan find
a way to save Trunks

266
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,416
from the clutches of
the sinister Dr. Myuu?

267
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,583
All these questions and
more will be answered

268
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:52,000
in the next action-packed
episode of Dragon Ball GT!
