00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,458
General Rilldo lay in defeat,

3
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,916
but the impending threat
of the bone-chilling Baby

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
was still a reality.

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,125
Meanwhile, the
mission to recover

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,750
the four remaining
Dragon Balls had begun,

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,125
and the voyagers from Earth
had their first ball on radar.

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,083
But retrieving it from
the war-ravaged ship

9
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
would be dangerous.

10
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,333
The vessel was about
to be engulfed

11
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,541
in the fire of a nearby star.

12
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,041
[NARRATOR]
After finding the Dragon Ball,

13
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,208
another discovery was made!

14
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,500
A young survivor was still
on board the spacecraft!

15
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,583
[GIRU] We have one minute
to leave the ship! Giru, Giru!

16
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,291
We've got a lot of
ground to cover!

17
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,041
Trunks, pick him
up and let's go!

18
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,458
--Hurry!
--Right!

19
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,833
[NARRATOR] The foursome
managed to escape from the ship,

20
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,000
but the gravitational
grip of the star

21
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,125
was pulling them
towards a fiery doom!

22
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,333
Using a Kamehameha Wave,

23
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,375
Goku gave them the
boost that freed them

24
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,166
from the star's deadly gravity.

25
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,458
Planet Vidal was the next stop.

26
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,625
Boasting state of the
art medical facilities,

27
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,666
it was the perfect
haven for recuperation!

28
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,166
But was something amiss

29
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,291
with the mysterious
survivor from outer space?

30
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,041
[NURSE] Please, get back to bed!
You have to have your rest.

31
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,666
[DOCTOR]
What? I'm serious!

32
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:52,875
[ORDERLY] We need to get
them out of there!

33
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,125
[NURSE] The Fire Department
is on the way!

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,583
[DOCTOR] There's no time!
They'll be fried!

35
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,833
[groaning]

36
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,291
[PAN] Excuse me! Doctors!
Where's the little boy?

37
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,875
He's still in there!

38
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,291
It's too hot for us to get past
the threshold of the doorway!

39
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,166
[all choking]

40
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,166
[GOKU] Hey, you guys!
Look what I found!

41
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,458
[laughs]

42
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,791
What an extraordinary child!

43
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,875
--Bravo!
--Truly!

44
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,375
Way to go, Grandpa! Yeah!

45
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,250
I hope this changes your
opinions about doctors, Grandpa!

46
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,958
They're on the same side
as you are! See? Huh?

47
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,416
[TRUNKS]
Hmm?

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,333
He's more scared
of them than before.

49
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,458
[PAN]
Huh? No...

50
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,875
Bet?

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,083
[DOCTOR] This boy is
either extremely lucky

52
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,000
or extremely unlucky!

53
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,125
[ORDERLY] Yeah. That's the
second time he's almost died

54
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,583
since he's been here!

55
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,666
[DOCTOR] And the second time
that he's been saved!

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,583
[Baby laughing in his head]

57

[PAN] Grandpa!
Stop acting so silly!

58
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,416
They don't want to
give you a shot!

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,416
There's nothing wrong with you!

60

I'm not going in there!
I hate hospitals!

61

You're acting like a
little baby, Grandpa!

62
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,916
Besides, they have
food in there!

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,708
[GOKU] I refuse to eat
any nasty hospital food!

64
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,041
But Goku! This planet
doesn't have restaurants!

65
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,666
You have to eat here!

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,958
Then I'll starve to death!

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,166
Hospital food has sick
germs, and it tastes bad!

This hospital is different!

What are we going to do?

are so easily manipulated

00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,125
It's a crime, really.

Surprise, surprise...

Those trusting fools are
making this all too easy for me.

[GOKU]
No! Let go!

83
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,916
In my present state it would
be risky to take them on

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,708
all at once, but if
I get one alone...

What are you doing out of bed?

Well, I'm embarrassed to say it,
but I can't stand getting shots!

Hi, there. The doctor
was looking for you.

00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,000
He said you should
still be in bed.

Now you see here, young man!
You need to get more bed rest!

Your condition was far more

It's not that I don't
advocate outdoor convalescence.

It's just that we
can't go from A to D.

First we have to go to B and C!

stomach starts growling!

159
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,750
I can't help it.
My body just runs out of gas.

160
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
It's been this way
ever since I was born.

161
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,000
[PAN] I thought
you guys went fishing!

162
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,375
Don't tell me you
didn't catch anything!

163
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,916
I caught dozens! But they tasted
so bad I couldn't eat them!

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,041
Those were some
nasty tasting fish!

165
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,625
He's not exaggerating!

166
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't talk about it!

167
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,458
That was the most
horrible experience ever!

168
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,458
You've been traumatized! Look!

169
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,916
You need some
immediate food therapy!

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Let's give the cafeteria
here a chance!

171
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,250
[GOKU] Never! They'll try
to give me a shot!

172
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,583
Oh, ho, ho!
We would never do such a thing!

173
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,041
We could lose our license

174
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,083
for giving a healthy
person an injection!

175
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,208
[TRUNKS] Really?
You wouldn't give me a shot

176
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,458
if I came in to eat? Promise?

177
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,875
Because I'd rather
starve than get a needle!

178
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,958
I assure you, nothing
of the sort would happen!

179
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,458
I swear on my honor
as a medical doctor!

180
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,208
Hmm.

181
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,000
[GIRU] Interesting! Ingoing mass
exceeds dimensions of stomach!

182
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:49,166
Wooooo! I feel mighty
again! Good food, huh?

183
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,250
One more plate, old man!

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,250
Y-Yes. One more.

185
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,208
Please excuse
my Grandpa, Doctor!

186
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,583
He has no manners because
he was raised in the wild!

187
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,458
[DOCTOR]
I see.

188
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,750
[NURSE]
Here you are.

189
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,916
Now that's service!

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,541
Trunks, you asked about our
technology... Is that correct?

191
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,750
[TRUNKS]
Yes!

192
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,916
You have a true
interest, don't you?

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,583
Might I satisfy
your fascination

194
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,541
with a grand tour of
our fine facility?

195
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,666
Yeah! I mean, yes! I'd like
that very much! Thank you!

196
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,166
That's what my family does
back home! We invent things!

197
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,583
Then it's settled!

198
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,916
I think you'll find the
technology here most intriguing!

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,916
[TRUNKS]
No doubt! Thanks, Doctor!

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,333
This is turning out
to be a great visit!

201
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,916
[Baby's evil laughter]

202
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,333
[DOCTOR] This is our 
Super Electron Microscope!

203
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,916
Wow! I like it!

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,083
[DOCTOR]
It's quite different than most

205
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,166
other Electron Microscopes.

206
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,041
I think you'll be
amazed at the detail.

207
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,041
[DOCTOR] Please! 
By all means! Take a look!

208
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,625
[TRUNKS]
Thank you!

209
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,500
[TRUNKS] This can't be!
These electrons are enormous!

210
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:25,041
And it's all 
three-dimensional! Wow!

211
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,166
[TRUNKS] You can
move amongst the atoms

212
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,083
as if you're in there with them!

213
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,708
An interactive microscope!
This is pure genius!

214
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,583
It's decades ahead
of any microscope

215
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,166
we've developed on Earth!

216
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,833
How beautiful! It's like
being in a whole new Universe!

217
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,583
And my board members said
that this couldn't be done!

218
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,500
What a bunch of--

219
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,125
Doc! Why?

220
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,125
[BABY] Because I want
your power! That's why!

221
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,375
That voice!
You're not the Doctor!

222
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,833
You're Baby! But how?

223
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,208
[evil giggling]

224
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,416
You thought you could
make Baby go away!

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,208
But as long as one of my
cells lives, I can regenerate!

226
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,375
[BABY] From there
it was simply a matter

227
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,541
of leap-frogging
from body to body,

228
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,333
until I gathered enough energy

229
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,375
to develop into
my current state.

230
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,166
But I'm not finished yet!

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,375
What about the spaceship?

232
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,375
What happened to all
the people on board?

233
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,583
Well, they became
baby food so to speak!

234
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,833
But at least they all died for
a worthy and historic purpose!

235
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,250
You fiend! How could
you do such a thing?

236
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,250
[maniacal laughter]

237
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,708
If you really want to know,
I'll show you first hand!

238
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,750
The tour didn't turn out
to be what I expected!

239
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:54,625
[GOKU]
I noticed! Haaaa!

240
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,541
You shouldn't have
picked a doctor to hide in.

241
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,125
I'm naturally on guard
against them as it is!

242
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,958
But how? How'd you
know I was alive?

243
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,208
I was able to sense your energy!

244
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,166
You did a perfect job
of suppressing it,

245
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,125
but you made one little slip!

246
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,208
When you attacked the doctor,

247
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,875
we were able to
feel your energy,

248
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,333
even if it was 
just for a minute!

249
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,916
We didn't know who you attacked!

250
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,791
But we did know you were
somewhere on the planet!

251
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,833
We figured you'd hide until
the odds were in your favor!

252
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,541
So, we decided to let ourselves
be put in vulnerable situations,

253
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,083
to try to draw you out!

254
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,166
This time we won't
make the same mistake!

255
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,625
We'll make sure that every
last cell is destroyed!

256
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,708
Hold on a second! Before this
gets serious, tell us one thing!

257
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,708
Where did the Dragon Ball
come from that you used

258
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,833
to lure us to that ship?

259
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,416
Not that it's any
of your business,

260
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
but that was the first
Dragon Ball we discovered!

261
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,416
It was digitized
and then transmitted

262
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,375
directly into
Doctor Myuu's head,

263
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,875
where it was then stored in
his memory banks as data!

264
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,708
Digitized! I see!
Do you have anymore like that?

265
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,916
[BABY]
No! I only had the one!

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,708
But after I kill all of you,
I'll have four! Won't I?

267
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,250
[GIRU]
Giru! Giru!

268
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,541
No more body snatching, Baby!

269
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,750
You would be free to go

270
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,083
if you weren't so intent
on hurting people!

271
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,000
[GOKU] You can't go on doing
what you did on that spaceship!

272
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,666
You spared no one!
Not even the children!

273
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,916
Ahhh!

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,666
[Baby screaming]

275
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,666
Ahhh!

276
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,750
[Baby giggles]

277
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,666
[screams]

278
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,500
We blew it!

279
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,291
Trunks, no!

280
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,750
[BABY] I've never felt
anything like this before!

281
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,416
This is the
Saiyan power I desire!

282
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,083
Hey! Get out of him right now!

283
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,250
All right! That does it!

284
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,541
Get out of my friend's body this
instant or I'll blast you out!

285
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,083
Grandpa! Wait! What do
you think you're doing?

286
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,333
What d'ya mean?

287
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,041
If you hit him with that
blast, Trunks will die!

288
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,750
I'll try to hit him in a
way that he stays alive!

289
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,958
What? Are you crazy?

290
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,625
[BABY] Goodbye! Not
even you can block this blast

291
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,750
from point-blank range!

292
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,875
[PAN]
Trunks! Don't do it!

293
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,375
[BABY]
What happened?

294
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,958
[TRUNKS]
I happened, Baby!

295
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,625
[BABY] What? No!
You shouldn't be able to talk!

296
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,666
I should be in complete
control of this body,

297
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,583
its mind, and all
of its functions!

298
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:38,916
He's talking to Trunks! Trunks?
Can you still hear me in there?

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,916
[TRUNKS] This is my body!
You get out of here! Right now!

300
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,666
[TRUNKS]
Get out!

301
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
[BABY]
He still resists!

302
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,916
What kind of absurdly powerful
people are these Saiyans?

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,208
[TRUNKS]
Get out of my body!

304
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,708
[Trunks screams]

305
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,000
[GOKU] That's it, Trunks!
Don't give in! You can do it!

306
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,000
[GOKU]
He did it!

307
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,250
[GIRU]
Yee-hoo!

308
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,250
[strained breathing]

309
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,041
I wasn't strong enough!

310
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,750
Taking over a Saiyan
requires more power!

311
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,916
Come on, Trunks!
Let's finish the job!

312
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,625
[GIRU]
Uh-oh! Giru, Giru.

313
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,500
[GIRU]
Baby is getting away!

314
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,166
We have to finish him now!

315
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,916
[STEWARDESS]
Ladies and gentlemen,

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,875
Flight 1138 is now
boarding on platform seven!

317
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,416
If you are carrying a handset,

318
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
tickets are still
available for purchase.

319
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,666
Thank you for choosing Starline
as your intergalactic carrier!

320
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,291
Starline! We fly on the
sunny side of every eclipse!

321
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
[LARGE LADY]
Hmm?

322
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,916
Oh?!

323
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,958
[screams]

324
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,958
[STEWARD]
Ma'am! Are you okay?

325
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,750
[LARGE LADY] Yes! I'm just
nervous about flying!

326
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,333
[STEWARD] Well, you have nothing
to worry about. Trust me.

327
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,375
[GOKU]
I sensed him for a second,

328
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,166
but now he's hiding
his energy again!

329
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,541
[STEWARDESS] Please limit
yourself to three pieces

330
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,333
of carry-on baggage!

331
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,708
This is the final call for all
passengers boarding Flight 1138!

332
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,208
Grandpa?

333
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,083
He could be in any
one of them. Couldn't he?

334
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,041
Yeah. We lost him.
Let's get back to the ship.

335
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,750
We'll never find him here.

336
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,458
Have a nice flight, Sir.

337
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,958
[MAN]
Thank you!

338
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,666
[STEWARDESS] Ma'm!
Have a nice flight.

339
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,291
I can't stand the thought that
someone has that sick creature

340
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,458
in their body right now.

341
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,583
That is so nasty!
He could be in anyone!

342
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,708
Who knows who he'll pick next!

343
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,750
[GIRU]
Giru. Giru.

344
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,833
I have a hunch it'll be someone
small and helpless like Giru!

345
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,666
[GIRU]
Giru! Giru! Giru!

346
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,916
What's he after? There's a whole
Universe he could prey on!

347
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,916
Why did he decide to lure us
to him with his Dragon Ball?

348
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,041
[PAN]
Hmm?

349
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,666
Well, I just assumed
it was because

350
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,625
he wanted to steal our
three Dragon Balls.

351
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,375
What else could it be?

352
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,958
He did seem a little
obsessed with Saiyan power.

353
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,208
Maybe it was our bodies
that he really wanted.

354
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,666
What do you think, Grandpa?

355
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,916
Who? Me? Well, I think
I need something to eat!

356
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,208
Uh! Don't answer this,
but do you ever

357
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,541
think about anything
other than food?

358
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:47,666
Huh? Yes. Of course, I do!

359
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,916
But not when I'm this hungry.

360
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,458
[NARRATOR] As Goku,
Pan, and Trunks plot a course

361
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,375
to retrieve the three
remaining Dragon Balls,

362
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,708
the insidious Neo-mutant, Baby,

363
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:05,583
feasts on the unsuspecting
passengers of Flight 1138!

364
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,916
[CAPTAIN]
Ladies and gentlemen,

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,666
please notice that the Fasten
Seat Belt sign has come on.

366
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,458
We're approaching
some solar winds

367
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,000
that might cause a little chop.

368
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,541
Thank you, and I hope you're
enjoying your flight so far.

369
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,583
[evil giggling]

370
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,541
Oh, I am!

371
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,083
[BABY] A paltry
meal to say the least,

372
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,166
but it seemed to
raise my spirit a bit!

373
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,375
Besides, it was better
than a bag of peanuts!

374
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,375
[evil giggling]

375
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,208
Now that the Saiyans have
revealed their true power to me,

376
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:44,500
I know exactly how much
power I need to destroy them!
