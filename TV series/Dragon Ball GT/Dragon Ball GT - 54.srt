[NUOVA SHENRON] What a pity.
I didn't expect the game

160
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,583
to end so abruptly!

161

[GOKU] Alright, my body's
actually responding!

Let's see how far
I can push it!

Not mean to Giru. Very nice.

Oh, no! Pan! Please wake up!

Yes, sleep peacefully.

There's nowhere to hide.

down the sewer too.

advantage down here!

another way out!

I've got two choices.

I can stay here and die or
I can jump through there!

It's just light energy
gathered from the Sun!

207
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,416
But it gets focused and
magnified when he shoots it

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,458
through that lens
and it becomes lethal!

of my Nuova Death Ray!

You're correct!

Goku has laid down the law,

240

but can he take the heat?
Having started the battle

241
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,500
exhausted and
depleted of energy,

242
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,625
how long can he push
himself to the limit

243
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,125
before he runs out
of gas completely?

Don't miss the next GT!
