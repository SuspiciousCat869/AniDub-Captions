00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,208
[NARRATOR] With the situation
looking as grim as ever,

2
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,416
Uub appeared on the Tuffle
planet to challenge Baby

3
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,250
But the training he put
in for this moment

4
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,500
proved to be inadequate
against the villain's fury.

5
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,833
[PAN]
No! Uub!

6
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,208
Say goodnight!

7
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,541
[NARRATOR] But an unlikely ally
would come to Uub's aide!

8
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,875
Thinking quickly, Buu realized
that he and Uub would be

9
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,958
a more effective force against
Baby as a single fighter.

10
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,041
[BUU]
That's right!

11
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,541
Time now for Buu and Uub
to become one.

12
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,000
[NARRATOR] Will this merging
of abilities be what it takes

13
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,666
to put an end to Baby's quest
for Tuffle vengeance?

14
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,208
[UUB]
What... What happened?

15
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:47,291
Thanks, Buu. I owe you.
You saved my life back there.

16
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,916
Now, let's go see Baby!

I get the feeling something
strange is happening.

24
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,333
[KIBITO] Well, it, looks as if
Uub and Buu have merged bodies.

25
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,625
They what?

26
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,041
[GOKU]
Wow! That is amazing!

27
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,833

they're getting ready

28

to fight down there.

29
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,833
Do you think we can make
this tail grow any faster?

If you would put your
concentration here

31
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,791
instead of on the
Tuffle planet, then yes.

Help him, Sugoro.

You got it!

What... What are you doing?

35
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,000
So, how is this
supposed to help?

36
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,625
You were squirming
around so much,

37
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,916
we've barely made any
progress on your tail.

Now, quit whining!

Isn't it supposed to hurt?

Well, it just doesn't seem like

you're trying too hard.

You've got me tied to a rock!

gathered enough
strength to fight me.

[GOKU] Just settle down
a minute and listen to me.

these as tight as you can.

What are you intending
to do here Goku?

was you grabbing onto my tail.

But that doesn't make any sense!

All you have to do
is hold on real tight,

then I'll fly away as
hard as I possibly can

00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,166
as any other animal!

160
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,708
[GOKU]
Hey!

161
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,583
My tail makes me the kind of
fighter that you'll never be!

162
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:48,666
[GOKU, BABY VEGETA grunting]

163
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,125
[GOKU]
Does it hurt?

164
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,083
You haven't gotten any
stronger at all, have you?

165
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,708
But I don't... understand...

166
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,333
My strength should
have skyrocketed

167
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,916
with my tail being
as long as it is.

168
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
[BABY VEGETA]
And it obviously hasn't worked!

169
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,625
[GOKU]
We'll see about that!

170
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,750
Hey! Let go of me!

171
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,125
[BABY VEGETA chuckling]

172
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,666
It's time for me to
remove that tail permanently!

173
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,333
[GOKU yelping]

174
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,333
[BABY VEGETA cackling]

175
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,625
Oh no, I can't stop him!
Old Kai, what's happening to me?

176
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,791
I... wish I knew.

177
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,625
[GOKU yelping]
[BABY VEGETA cackling

178
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,750
It's time for you
to die, Saiyan!

179
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,708
[GOKU screams]

180
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,708
Quite a pathetic effort

181
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,958
from the mightiest
Saiyan of them all.

182
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,166
[GOKU groaning]

183
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,541
[GOKU]
This is not what I had planned.

184
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,000
How can he always be
one step ahead of me,

185
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,458
like he's constantly
reading my mind!

186
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,583
[KIBITO] Old Kai, what's
happened to Goku?

187
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,541
He's getting thrown around
like a rag doll out there.

188
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,083
Is it possible that we
pulled out his tail out too far?

189
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,416
[OLD KAI] I doubt it. Maybe it
takes a while to kick in.

190
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,625
[GOKU]
Earth, she's so beautiful.

191
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,750
Just the thought of me not
being able to protect her...

192
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,708
...makes me cringe.

193
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,875
[BABY VEGETA cackling]

194
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,208
[GOKU] I have so many
fond memories of home.

195
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,750
I'll miss it so much.

196
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,333
All of my family and friends.

197
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,041
Those who have been at my
side through the worst of times.

198
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,333
I can't bear not being able
to save them from Baby.

199
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:42,625
Please, give me the power
I need to end this madness.

200
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,458
[BABY VEGETA] It's time finish
this once and for all.

201

[OLD KAI mumbling]

206
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,208
Old Kai! Come quickly!
It's Goku. He's changing!

207
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,000
[OLD KAI]
He's what?!

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,625
[BOTH cheering]

209
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,708
It's beginning! Oh yes,
it's finally beginning!

No! It can't be!

[GORILLA GOKU growling]

221
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,750
[BABY VEGETA] He's changing into
the same kind of dirty animal

222
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,666
that devastated my people.

223
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,250
But... but it makes no sense!

224
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,666
There needs to be a full moon

225
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,750
for this kind of
transformation to happen!

226
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,791
It... can't be!

227
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,833
[BABY VEGETA] He's using the
earth in place of the full moon!

228
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:34,708
[GORILLA GOKU roaring]

[NARRATOR] After an
excruciating training session,

230
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,125
Goku's hidden powers have
finally risen to the surface.

231
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,208
Will Goku's transformation
be the final push he needs

232
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,000
to topple Baby for good?

233
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,583
Find out the fate of
humanity's last hope
