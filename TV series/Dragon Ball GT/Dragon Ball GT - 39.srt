Super Saiyan Four Goku found
his energy completely used up.

Powerless to defend himself,

the mighty Saiyan lay helpless
before the monstrous Baby,

to transform into a giant ape!

00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,916
I'm right here, Father.

00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,166
Lord Baby!

163
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,458
[BABY BULMA] We're prepared
to fight until the end, Baby!

164
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,791
We might not win, but we'll show
them what Tuffles are made of!

165
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,541
[BABY]
Get out of my way!

166
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,083
Idiot!

[BABY BULMA coughing]

00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,958
Baby! Take me with you!

169
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,875
[TRUNKS] Baby's on there
alright! I can sense him!

170
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,375
[PAN] You're not gonna let him
escape! Are you, Grandpa?

171
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,541
No, Pan. Don't worry.

172
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,125
[BABY] Fools! You haven't
seen the last of me!

00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,375
[SS4 GOKU]
Perfect, any second now.

174
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,625
Right on schedule!

Ka... Me... Ha... Me... Ha!

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,958
[BABY]
What's going on?

177
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,708
No! This-this
can't be happening!

[BABY screaming]

[BABY screaming]

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,791
[SS4 GOKU] His energy signal has
disappeared! It's finally over!

181
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,208
[GOHAN]
That ought to do it!

182
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,416
Baby's cells were
destroyed in the Sun.

183
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
He won't be able to regenerate.

184
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,291
Woo-hoo!

00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,500
Grandpa!

186
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,583
[PAN] You just refuse to grow
up, don't you, Grandpa?

187
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,208
Couldn't you have just
stayed as a Super Saiyan Four?

188
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,000
[GOKU] What's wrong
with the way I am?

189
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,500
I guess nothing, I'll take
you any way I can get you.

190
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,000
But not, Grandma!

191
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,833
I'm sure she wants her
full-sized husband back!

192
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,333
I guess you're right!

193
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,666
Oh, well, I can transform into
Super Saiyan Four anytime!

194
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,166
Oh? Is that right?

195
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
So, when we have
Grandparents' Day at school,

196
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,166
can you transform
so you're full grown?

197
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,916
I'll think about it!

198

[ALL laughing]

00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,250
Hey, before I forget,

200
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,916
we'd better disperse this
to the rest of the Earth!

201
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,791
A light mist ought
to do the trick!

202
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,166
Would you like to do
the honors, Dende?

203
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,291
Sure!

204
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,833
While you're treating
the people here,

205
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,583
I'll go to Planet Tuffle and
get that mess straightened out!

206
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,208
Hey, Gohan! Would you
mind giving me a hand?

207
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,875
No, I'd love to, Kibito Kai.

here? I must have blacked out!

[GOKU] Ah, now this is the
way it's supposed to be!

What in the world is going on?

00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,333
I don't know.

It's been almost a year since

216
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,833
the Black Star Dragon Balls
were used!

217
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,916
The Earth is about to blow up!

218
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,750
What?! But we brought
the Black Star balls

219
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,291
back to Earth, Mister Popo!

220
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,666
Remember?!

221
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,791
[POPO] I would never forget
something so important!

222
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,333
[DENDE] Obviously you did
since Earth is still here,

223
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,916
but I just can't remember
what happened next.

224
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,833
[GOKU] I handed
them right to you!

225
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,500
Where did you put them, Dende?

[DENDE]
I-I don't remember!

Are you crazy? How
could you forget?!

228
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,416
You're right!
I must be going crazy!

229
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,416
We must have already
been infected

230
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,625
when Goku gave us
the Dragon Balls!

231
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,500
Yes! I remember now!

232
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,083
I had the Dragon Balls
and I gave them to Baby!

233
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,375
Time must have reset
after Baby's wish!

[DENDE] What have I done?
I've failed the Earth!

I don't deserve to be
Guardian anymore!

It's okay.

But we'd better figure
out exactly how much

time we have left so we
can come up with a plan!

Hang on, I'm figuring it out.
This is bad, you guys!

their victory over Baby,

an even greater
threat has emerged!

With just two weeks to
search the entire galaxy

246
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,625
for the
Black Star Dragon Balls,

247
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,416
what hope does the Earth
have for survival?

the next Dragon Ball GT!
