Shenron to restore order.

but the terrible
Black Smoke Dragon!

It is known that the mighty
Shenron will grant a wish

the Dragon Balls

Grandpa, I have a question.

31
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,875
[PAN] The two-starred ball
turned back to normal

32

when we beat Haze Shenron.

33
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,000
So Earth should be getting
back to normal too, right?

34
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,083
Which means that since there
are seven Dragon Balls in all,

35
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:42,458
one, two, three, four, five--
if we topple six dragons,

You're about to find out.

[RAGE SHENRON shrieks]

162
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,541
So, we've made one of our
little transformations, I see.

00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,500
You changed first, Rage.
I just evened the playing field.

Well, I was kind of cold.
Thanks for warming me up.

Get him, Grandpa!

But a whole lot of people

don't have much time left.

There are still five other

when I'm done here.

It seems you can take a hit,

179
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,833
but you certainly
can't dish it out.

stood up to that attack.

That electric slime is amazing.

That's impossible.

stand up to your attack.

I'm just holding on
to it for a moment.

You have no idea who
you're messing with, Goku!

You're no more damaging
to me than a sunburn!

189
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,375
Uh... It's kinda embarrassing
to be hit with my own attack.

00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,958
I gotta give you some credit.

get the best of him.

At that enormous size,

248
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,000
he couldn't take
shelter from the rain.

249

pretty conceited
