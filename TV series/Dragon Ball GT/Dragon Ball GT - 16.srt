00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,250
[PAN grunts]

316
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,416
[GIRU]
Leave her alone.

317
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
[NAT]
Do not interfere.

318
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,208
[GIRU] Pan cannot
escape this planet.

319
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,750
The Guard Bots will find her.

320
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,333
The other two
are most important.

321
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,750
They are in possession of the
Dragon Ball the General wants.

322
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,916
Giru! What are
you talking about?

323
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,708
[GIRU] The General will be
happy about the Dragon Ball.

324
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,458
[NEZI]
Point well taken.

325
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,208
To the General!

326
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,416
You're one of them?

327
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,041
You've deceived us all
along! You traitor!

328
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,208
I was such an idiot
to ever believe him.

329
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,708
[NARRATOR]
Giru has betrayed everyone.

330
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,541
After weeks of gaining their
trust, Giru has put his friends

331
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,000
in the hands of General Rilldo,

332
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,541
What does the General
have in store for them?

333
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,000
