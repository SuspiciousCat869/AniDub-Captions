Previously on GT...

00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,541
Goku and Pan had the first
four Shadow Dragons on the run

00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,875
as each one of them met
their untimely doom!

settle this without fighting.

I don't think so, Nuova Shenron!
I'm not buying it!

[NUOVA SHENRON]
Goku was right!

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,291
In a flash,
the deadly dragon

14
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,833
shattered his old persona
to make way for the new!

15

[NARRATOR] The stakes had been
raised, but Goku was ready.

He, too, assumed his
ultimate fighting form!

There's no one in the

and you could have
anything you wanted!

be out of your grasp!

Look, I've got everything I ever
wanted right here on Earth!

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,125
Listen Kakarot!

162
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,541
Just because we've agreed
to fight together this time

163
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,666
doesn't mean that anything
has changed between us!

164
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,208
Do you understand me?

165
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:52,250
Once this mess is over, it'll
be you and me, head to head!

166
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,291
Sure.

167
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,833
[VEGETA] And now you're making
light of me again, aren't you?!

168
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,458
How dare you!

169
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,250
[BULMA] Just leave
everything to me, Vegeta!

170
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,041
[VEGETA] I changed
because of you, Kakarot.

171
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,458
You showed me that
ruthlessness wasn't the key

172
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,041
to acquiring power.

173
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,833
I tried to be good like you,

174
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,208
but the Saiyan
in me would not die!

175
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:46,041
I wanted my old edge back,
my killer instinct!

176
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,083
[GOKU]
Vegeta!

177
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,875
You'll fight with me, Kakarot!

178
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,333
Unless, of course,

179
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,458
you'd like more bodies to
pile up on your conscience!

180
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,375
Please, Vegeta! Tell me
you wouldn't do that.

181
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,791
How sad. I didn't think you were
weak enough to be controlled.

182
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,500
[GOKU gasps]

183
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:28,000
Tell me! Tell me what has more
meaning than your own strength!

184
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,625
[VEGETA] I have the blood
of a Saiyan Prince in me!

185
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,166
He is nothing but a joke!

186
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,541
Yet I had to watch him
surpass me in strength!

187
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,041
My destiny thrown
to the wayside!

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's, he's even saved my life as
though I were a helpless child!

189
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,833
He has stolen my honor...

190
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,750
...and I want it back!

191
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,291
[GOKU] Babidi! Transport us
to a place away from people!

192
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,250
If you give me that,
then I'll fight Vegeta!

193
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,750
Papararapa!

194
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,458
[GOKU]
The more time we spend fighting,

195
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:16,000
the more energy will
go to fuel Majin Buu!

196
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,333
So if it's alright with you,
let's just skip the warm-up!

197
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,625
Have it your way!

198
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,833
I'll go straight to
the part where I kill you

199
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,750
if that's what you want.

[VEGETA yelling]

201
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,166
It's quite a shame. I considered
you my friend, Vegeta.

202
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,083
Wake up! This is it!
Our destiny!

[VEGETA panting]

205
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,958
I'm amazed, Vegeta.

206
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,708
These last seven
years in Other World

207
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,541
I've been through the most
intense training sessions ever.

208
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,916
But we're still
completely even.

209
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,041
I guess this whole time
you've been pushing yourself

210
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,958
even harder than I have!

211
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,458
[VEGETA]
That may be true.

212
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,000
I've pushed myself to the
edge of my limits and beyond.

213
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,333
But you were born with a natural
talent far beyond my own.

214
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,625
No amount of training could
have closed the gap between us.

215
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,291
[VEGETA]
I realize that now.

216
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,083
It was made painfully
obvious to me today

217
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,291
as I watched your fight
with Babidi's monster!

218
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,041
I finally grasped
the undeniable truth

219
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,916
that no matter
how hard I tried,

220
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,083
I would never be
able to catch you!

221
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,708
That I was destined to live
forever in the shadow

222
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,958
of a low level clown!

223
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,250
So that's when I
secretly made up my mind.

224
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,875
You mean you, please no!

225
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,541
You deliberately let yourself
fall under Babidi's spell!

226
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,708
I'd say the end more
than justifies the means!

227
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,541
Vegeta, I don't understand!

228
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,458
You've never allowed anyone
to help you before in your life!

229
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,875
Why start now?! Why Babidi?!

230
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,541
[VEGETA] Because I wanted him to
reawaken the evil in my heart!

231
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,375
I wanted him to return me
to the way I was before!

232
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,083
I was the perfect warrior!
Cold and ruthless!

233
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:20,125
I lived by my strength alone!
Uninhibited by foolish emotion!

234
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,083
But slowly,
over the years...

235
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,875
...I became one of you!

236
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,208
My quest for greatness
gradually giving way

237
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,416
to this life of mediocrity!

238
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,291
[VEGETA] I awoke one day to find
that I had settled down

239
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,500
and formed a family.

240
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,208
I had even grown
quite fond of them.

241
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,541
Would you believe that I almost
started to think the Earth

242
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,958
was a nice place to live.

243
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you understand
now, Kakarot?

244
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,166
That's why I needed Babidi!
To set me free!

245
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,875
By releasing the
evil in my heart!

246
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,208
He has freed me of
my petty attachments!

247
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,208
And I must say it
feels pretty good!

248
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,375
Do you really believe
what you're saying?

249
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,708
I thought I believed. Yes.

250
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,083
But you were right, Kakarot.

251
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,958
[VEGETA] Suddenly I was up
against insurmountable odds!

252
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,333
Death was immanent but I
didn't care about myself,

253
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,791
I could think only of my son!

254
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,958
I decided to shed my
mortal coil in an attack

255
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,000
that would rid the Earth
of that monster for good,

256
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,916
so that my son could live on.

257
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,375
But even my sacrifice failed!

258
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,125
And, once again, it was you
who had to come to the rescue!

259
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,000
And as a Super Saiyan 3 no less!

260
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:54,041
A level that I didn't
even dream was possible!

261
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,875
The greatest battle that was
ever waged was taking place...

262
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,625
...and I was reduced
to being its witness!

263
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,000
[VEGETA]
Is that my lot in life?

264
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,333
To bear witness
to your strength?

265
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,583
To be the only one strong
enough to be able to fathom

266
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,166
the depth of your might?

267
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,583
I refuse to play that role!

268
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,833
Aren't you the busy woman?

269
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,625
[BULMA] Come check it out!
It's a Blutz Wave generator!

270
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,666
[VEGETA] Blutz Wave
generator? What's it for?

271
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,666
[BULMA]
It's for you, silly!

272
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,583
To help you transform
to Super Saiyan 4!

273
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,375
What?

274
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,625
Are you serious?

275
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,416
This device can help me
become a Super Saiyan 4?

276
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,333
Now you know I wouldn't kid
you about something like that!

277
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,916
It's still just a theory,
but I think it'll work!

278
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We learned quite a bit about
Blutz Waves on Planet Tuffle

279
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,041
and I just happen to
have a copy of the files!

280
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,291
[VEGETA] Whoa! I don't want
to be reminded of that face!

281
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,666
[BULMA]
I've had better days.

282
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,041
Okay, this should be
Goku's transformation.

283
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,541
[BULMA]
Wow! Look at him!

284
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,291
[VEGETA]
Kakarot, always showing off.

285
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,333
[BULMA] This initial
transformation was triggered

286
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,166
by the Moon's Blutz Waves
reflecting off the Earth,

287
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,500
but Goku just became
a wild beast.

288
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,041
He was out of control.

289
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,125
It was Pan who helped him
remember who he was!

290
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,375
Grandpa,

291
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,958
you wouldn't hurt me, would you?

292
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,291
[BULMA] Once Goku became fully
conscious of himself again,

293
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
it sparked this transformation.

294
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,791
Of course, he was also
still absorbing Blutz Waves.

295
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,666
[VEGETA]
That's it! Super Saiyan 4!

296
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,500
Now, here's the thing!

297
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,083
[BULMA] Since you're already
fully conscious of who you are

298
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,875
when you become a giant ape,

299
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,875
you should be able to
go Super Saiyan 4

300
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,750
if we flood your body with
enough Blutz Waves!

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,791
I don't know.
Don't you remember?

302
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,000
I did transform into a
giant ape on Planet Tuffle,

303
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,750
and I was exposed to Blutz
Waves, but nothing happened.

304
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,750
Yeah, I have that
file right here,

305
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:13,041
and it's true, you didn't
turn into Super Saiyan 4.

306
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,041
[BULMA]
But the part that confuses me

307
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,666
is that you're both Saiyans.

308
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,916
So if Goku did it, you should
have been able to do it, too.

309
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,583
There must have
been some condition

310
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,541
that was present for him,
that wasn't present for you.

311
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,708
Perhaps. Yes. It could
have been that Kakarot

312
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,083
was a pure blooded
Saiyan and I wasn't.

313
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,000
After all, I did have
that despicable creature

314
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,625
living inside my
body at the time!

315
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,833
Another variable was
your physical condition.

316
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,333
Your body might
not have been able

317
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,916
to withstand
the transformation.

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
[VEGETA]
Could that be the reason?

319
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:49,583
Was I simply not strong
enough to handle it?

320
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,750
But that was then,
and this is now!

321
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,666
I know you're ready! I can tell!

322
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,083
You've been training
like never before!

323
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,958
Okay, now we just need to get
the conditions right for you.

324
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,291
After that, you might
even reach Super Saiyan 5!

325
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,583
[VEGETA]
Super Saiyan 5? Are you serious?

326
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,041
You really believe that
I can surpass Kakarot?

327
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,791
You are the Prince of
all Saiyans, aren't you?

328
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,458
Yes I am!

329
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,208
So, Kakarot! The race
isn't over yet! Is it?

330
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,000
The day of the dark horse
is coming to an end!

331
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,375
The true thoroughbred
is making his move

332
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,083
to the front of the pack!

333
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,583
What about me? I think I
deserve a little recognition!

334
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:33,250
Well, if you're a Prince, that
makes me a Princess, right?

335
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,458
[NARRATOR] Can Bulma really help
Vegeta realize his dream

336
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,083
of surpassing Goku's strength?

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,666
Oblivious to anything
except the task at hand,

338
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,458
Goku prepares to
battle Nuova Shenron!

339
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:53,041
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next GT!
