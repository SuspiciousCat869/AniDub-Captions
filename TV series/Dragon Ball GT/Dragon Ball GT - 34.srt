if he could somehow wrap
his mind around his new powers,

World Martial Arts Tournament.

161
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,791
See?

162
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,958
It's one of my most
precious possessions.

163
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,958
[PAN] You've got to try
and remember, Grandpa!

164
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,583
[PAN shrieks]

165
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
It's useless.

166
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,166
I guess his heart turned into
an animal with the rest of him.

167
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,208
[PAN] That's when we
all went to the beach

168
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,458
when I was just a baby.

169
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,333
It's days like this that
make all of the hard times

170
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,166
we've been through
seem worth it.

171
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,625
Well I have to admit,
I do miss all of the fighting.

172
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,416
But here I get to
be with you guys.

173
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,583
Grandpa...

174
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,625
[PAN]
You can't forget your family!

175
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,708
I'm not going to let you!

176
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,583
[GORILLA GOKU gasps]

177
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
[YOUNG PAN]
Look at me, Grandpa!

178
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,916
[GOKU]
Don't go too far, Pan!

179
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,666
[YOUNG PAN screaming]

180
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,416
[GOKU] Ah, what's wrong?
[YOUNG PAN sobbing]

181
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,583
[GOKU] You're not scared of
those little waves, are ya?

182
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,875
[YOUNG PAN] No, the water
tastes terrible, like salt.

183
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,666
[GOKU] Of course it does! Not
everyone who goes in the water

184
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,458
gets out to use the
bathroom, you know.

185
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,416
Do you remember?

186
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,583
[PAN yelps]

187
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:07,208
[GORILLA GOKU growling]

188
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,708
[BABY VEGETA] What's that
transformation I sense?

189
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:30,833
[GORILLA GOKU growling]

190
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,500
[PAN gasps]

191
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,208
[NARRATOR] Pan's persistence
has broken through Goku's

192
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:42,000
primitive mind and brought forth
yet another transformation.

193
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,416
But will Goku again have to deal
with the same lack of control

194
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,416
he had as a giant ape?

195
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,208
