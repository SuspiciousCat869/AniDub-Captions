[NARRATOR]
On the last GT,

2
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,291
urgent preparations
were being made

3
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,583
for an expedition
into outer space

4
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,208
to recover the
Black Star Dragon Balls!

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,250
Hi, Mama! Papa told me
I should come help you!

6
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,750
Not right now...

7
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,625
I still don't understand!

8
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,791
Why do we have to go with him?

9
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,500
[NARRATOR] Vegeta appointed
himself head recruiter

10
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,250
and rounded up a
flight crew for Goku.

11
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,458
Main power link...

12
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,916

[BULMA]
All systems are go for launch.

14
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,250
[NARRATOR] While giving the ship
 a quick once over,

15
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,375
Goku and Trunks found
an unexpected stowaway!

16
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,791
Hi!

17
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,875
Hi, there Pan!

18
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,166
What's going on?

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,666
Oh, no? Then let's
get serious! Blast off!

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,125
[NARRATOR] And so the
galaxy-wide search

21
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,625
for the Black Star
Dragon Balls began--

22
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,291
a few minutes
earlier than intended

23
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,833
and with a slightly
different crew!

24
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,000
[NARRATOR] Before the
smoke had even cleared,

25
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,416
a troubling discovery was made.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,875
A small part has fallen
off of the spaceship.

27
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,333
[NARRATOR] Will the loss of this
part be a minor incovenience...

28
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,458
[BULMA]
Hmm?

29
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,500
[NARRATOR]
...or a recipe for disaster?

[TRUNKS] Pan, this isn't funny!
Give it back right now!

Pan! Give me that

34
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,791
Why? So you can take me
back to my boring life on Earth?

35
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,333
Forget it!

Pan, this mission's way too
dangerous for a child. Please.

[CHICHI] Well, let's see...
I do laundry once a week.

49
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,125
So if I do laundry
51 more times,

50
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,666
they should just be getting
home while I'm folding.

Come on... How many
parts are on this ship?

53
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,708
It's got to belong somewhere.

54
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,833

Bring our granddaughter back

Huh?

You don't expect me to
do everything, do you?

65
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,708
Trunks, you can do
the laundry! How's that?

What? Me? Do laundry?!

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,291
Sure! Why not? And Grandpa,
you can be the head dishwasher!

68
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,708
Well, maybe we should wait
until you get more experience

69

before we make
you head dishwasher!

I end up breaking them.

with you! All you have to do is

take your time and be careful!

Yes, of course.

76
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,625
But maybe we shouldn't be
assigning chores just yet, Pan.

We share the housework
equally and that's that!

00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,125
We just had a very
trying experience.

163
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh, it's very peaceful here!

164
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,916
Great! Then we'd like
to get a room, please!

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,875
Yes! But of course!

166
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,583
[HOTEL CLERK] Fitting a
room is like fitting a shoe!

167
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,958
Can you believe this thing cost
two hundred and fifty Gametz?!

168
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,458
And they practically
forced it on me!

169
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, but at least
the food was good!

170
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,333
Aahhh!
That's what this is about!

171
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,125
You've been taken in
by our street merchants!

172
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,500
Haven't you, Sir?

173
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,583
Yeah, they did
a number on us all right!

174
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,833
And like naïve tourists,
we fell right into their trap!

175
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,416
Well, now that
you're in our hands,

176
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
you can relax and enjoy Imecka!

177
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,416
Our porter will
take you to your room!

Allow me!

00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,833

Let me get that!

[screams]

181
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,125
I'm not a bag! I'm a
person, you stupid robot!

182
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:57,166
[GOKU] Put me down!
What kind of robot are you?

183
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,041
[PORTER]
I am a Porterbot 3000,

184
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,041

and deliver luggage

in a prompt
and courteous manner.

186
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
[GOKU] Yeah, well,
you must have a screw loose

187
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,041
because I'm not luggage!

188
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,875
[PORTER] This is
where you will be staying.

189
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,458
I hope you enjoy
your honeymoon.

190
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,291
Hmm?

00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,958
[sigh of disbelief]

00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:16,708
[double beep]

193
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,000
It looks like a palace!

194
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,541
[PORTER]
The Bridal Suite is equipped

195
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,708
with our gold star amenities
package for your comfort!

196
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,750
It's almost too nice.

197
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,083
You can put our
luggage down now!

198

[PORTER] We hope you enjoy your
stay! Please insert gratuity!

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,750
[GOKU] Uhh, Trunks... I think he
wants us to give him some money.

200
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,708
I guess he's programmed for
more than carrying luggage.

201
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,583
[PORTER] Thank you,
Sir or Ma'am! Welcome to Imecka!

202
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
Please ring the front desk

203
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,875
if I can be of any
further assistance! Enjoy!

[relieved breath]

205
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,250
I'm going to go
soak in a nice hot bath!

206
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,083
I hope they have some food
around here. I'm starving.

207
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,791
[NEWS REPORTER] People from
all over Imecka flocked to the

208
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,250
royal palace today to get a
glimpse of Lord Don Kee himself.

209
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
Once a week,
Don Kee grants an audience

210
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,083
to the citizens of his kingdom.

211
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,458
[WOMAN]
Don Kee!

212
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,958
[CITIZENS]
Don Kee!!

213
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,083
[mass cheering]

214
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, so much for democracy.
It looks like a dictatorship.

215
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,333
[PAN] You guys! There's
something wrong with the shower!

216
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,708
I can't turn the water off!
It just keeps on running!

217
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,625
[TRUNKS]
Just a sec! I'm coming!

218
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,958
[metal clank]

219
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,291
What in the world?!

220
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,458
[GOKU] Trunks! Pan!
I found the fridge!

221
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,916
This is too good to be true!
I hit the jackpot!

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,625
The food won't stop coming out!

223
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,458
Something's strange
about this hotel!

224
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,500
They have a meter on
the shower like a taxi-cab!

225
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,208
[groans]

226
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,541
[PAN] The number keeps
getting higher and higher!

227
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,750
It's already past
seven thousand!

228
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,625
[ticking]

229
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,041
Strange...
What's that noise?

230
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,000
[ticking]

231
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,791
[TRUNKS]
You've got to be kidding me!

232
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,833
There are money-meters
everywhere! This is insane!

233
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,583
We're being charged
for everything!

234
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,166
Even for watching TV!

235
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,541
[horrified gasps]

236
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:30,791
[ding...ding...ding...]

237
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,416
[TRUNKS]
They're robbing us blind!

238
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,625
They even have the nerve

239
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,291
to charge us for looking
at the decorations!

240
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,958
[TRUNKS] I've never skipped
a check before, but let's go!

241
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,208
Ahhh! Just a second, you guys!

242
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,583
Goku! Come on!

243
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,625
Well, we picked one heck of
a planet to crash land on,

244
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,208
didn't we?

245
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,916
I don't know about this trip.
Nothing seems to be going right.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,416
We did kind of
get off to a bad start.

247
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,250
Are you insinuating that
this is all my fault?!

248
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,541
Well, we were still checking the
ship when you pushed the button.

249
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,708
You're the one who let those
bunglers make a wish on

250
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,041
the Black Star Balls right under
your nose! It's your fault!

251
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,000
I guess you're right.
It is my fault.

252
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,291
Oh, no you don't! I know what
you're trying to do, Grandpa!

253
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,750
You're trying to act like you're
the one to blame! Aren't you?!

254
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,916
Well you can stop acting!
Because you really are to blame!

255
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,041
No sense in
staying out in the rain!

256
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,625
We might as well
head back to the ship

257
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,291
and spend the night there.

258
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,333
[PAN] I am not walking
all the way back to the ship

259
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,541
in the rain.

260
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,916
I am way too tired.
And hungry! And cold!

Good evening.

[FUTOVA] We've never actually
met any aliens before.

I hope you're enjoying
your stay on Imecka!

269
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,125
It's a nice place, but
the people are strange.

270
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,208
It seems all they care
about is making money!

271
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,125
I've never met a greedier
bunch of scammers before!

No, let her speak her mind!

Your child's honesty is
refreshing, isn't it?

275
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,208
Yes! And I'm ashamed to
admit that she's right.

276
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,333
You people are nice. Why is
everyone else so money hungry?

277
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Our leader-Don Kee's to blame.

278
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,458

Are they coming here?

00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,875
I think so.

282
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,000
[siren approaches]

283
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,416
[REPO-ROBOT]
Nobody move!

284
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,583
The lease has expired
on this dwelling place!

[REPO-ROBOT] Produce the funds
needed to renew your lease

Your time to renew has expired.

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,125
Future rental inquiries must
be made at the palace.

[REPO-ROBOT] We will now
dismantle and repossess!

Hey, is this all right?
They're taking everything.

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You won't have a home
left for your children.

294
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,333
It can't be helped. My income
has been insufficient lately

295
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,750
to afford
the luxury of a dwelling.

296
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,250
Prices have been at a premium

297
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,125
ever since Lord Don Kee
became our King.

298
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,750
I saw him on TV.

299
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,166
[FUTOVA]
That's him.

300
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Long ago things were affordable,
and we had no trouble

301
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:23,500
providing for our families. But
now we are all deeply in debt.

302
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,833
Our futures are sold
before we live them.

303
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,791
But we still have our reasons.
Our reasons for pressing on,

304
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,833
regardless of what
humiliation we must endure.

305
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,000
[FUTOVA]
I seem to have lost my roof.

306
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,250
[sympathetic horror]

307
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,125
More embarrassing
are the low practices

308
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,625
my people have resorted to.

309
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,000
But don't judge them. Truly,
they're only trying to survive.

310
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:47,458
It's hard to maintain integrity
in the face of adversity.

311
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,916
Only a few of us have managed.

312
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,916
But it usually means
losing one's house--

313
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,500
a tough pill to swallow.

314
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,291
That's why many of us
have become swindlers.

315
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,041
That's so sad.

316
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,125
How terrible.

317
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,833
[REPO-ROBOT] Your dwelling has
been reclaimed by Lord Don Kee!

318
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,375
Repo-robots, move out!

319
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,958
[GOKU]
I'm no lawyer,

320
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,000
but I think I know how
we can get your house back!

321
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,250
You're a very brave child.

322
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,916
But I'm afraid the use of
force is out of the question.

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,458
[FUTOVA]
Don Kee is too powerful.

324
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,166
If we were to offer any
physical resistance,

325
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,750
the Don would send out his
army and ravage us all.

326
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,375
We have enough
hardships already.

327
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,666
We don't want to add bloodshed

328
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,833
of our loved ones to
the weight of our burden.

329
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,083
[WIFE]
But thank you for your concern.

330
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,833
You are very caring people.

331
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,250
I hope those nice people

332
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,500
can find a way to get
their problems sorted out.

333
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,166
Yeah, I do, too.

334
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
I don't feel right. I wish there
were something we could do

335
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,833
to help those people
get their house back.

336
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,041
Yeah, it's hard,

337
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,166
but every planet has
its share of problems.

338
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,125
If we tried to solve
them all ourselves,

339
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,208
it would take a lifetime.

340
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,000
And besides, if we don't find
the Dragon Balls in a year,

341
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,083
the Earth is going to have

342
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,625
far more serious
problems than high rent.

343
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,750
Hey, maybe there's a Dragon Ball
on this planet! You never know!

344
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,250
We haven't checked! Have we?

345
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,500
[TRUNKS] No, but I can
tell you there's not.

346
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,500
[PAN]
How do you know?! Check!

347
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,000
[TRUNKS]
If you insist.

348
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:46,583
Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru!
Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru...!

349
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,000
[GIRU]
Hmmm...

350
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,250
[slurps]

351
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,458
[gasps]

352
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,250
Without that radar our
whole mission is history!

353
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,041
[GIRU] Need energy!
Energy needed to function!

354
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,750
Daa, Daa, Daa, Daaaaa!
Giru! Now fully operational!

355
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,750
Why you! That's ours!
Give it back to us right now!

356
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,291
[GIRU] Not capable! Giru! Device
integrated into system!

357
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,291
Giru! Giru!

358
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,833
That's our Dragon Radar!

359
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,250
If we lose that, we can kiss
Earth and our families goodbye!

360
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,458
[GIRU] Already integrated!
Kiss goodbye!

361
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,958
What?!

362
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,916
--Giru! Giru...!
--Oh, no! Look!

363
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,833
[loud motor]

364
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,041
Hey! Come back here with that!

365
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,208
[GIRU] Giru!
Giru! Giru! Giru!

366
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,041
[GIRU] Giru!
Giru! Giru! Giru!

367
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,791
Ahh! Man!

368
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,666
Darn! You get back here,
you little runt!

369
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,333
--Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru!
--Give me that!

370
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,041
--Giru! Giru! Giru! 
--Oh, no you don't!

371
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,625
Pan! Heads up! Three o'clock!

372
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,125
[GIRU] Giru! Giru!
Giru! Giru! Giru...!

373
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,541
--I got it! 
--I got it!

374
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,125
[crash]

375
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,291
[GOKU]
Hey, guys!

376
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,791
Is this what you're looking for?

377
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,833
[GIRU] Giru.
Giru. Giru. Giru.

378
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,625
[PAN]
And there goes our ship.

379
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,916
They've got some nerve.

380
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,625
[TRUNKS] Unbelievable. This
just isn't our planet, guys.

381
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,750
That's all there is to it.

382
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,458
[NARRATOR] With the Dragon Radar
in the belly of a robot,

383
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,416
and their spaceship
disappearing over the horizon,

384
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,458
Trunks, Goku, and Pan
have a difficult road ahead.

385
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,833
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next GT!
