00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,125
[NARRATOR] In the face of Omega
Shenron's overwhelming power,

2
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,666
it appeared that Goku
had finally fallen

3
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,791
at the hands of
the last Shadow Dragon.

4
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,125
But from under this
blanket of despair,

5
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,750
a miracle suddenly
revealed itself.

6
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,375
Hey wait!
I thought I killed you!

7
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,083
[GOKU] Everybody!
Give me all of your energy!

8
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,583
Impossible, how did he do that?

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,750
This is it!

10
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,250
No, No! Hold on!

11
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,916

[OMEGA SHENRON gasps]

13
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,416
[NARRATOR] Following Goku's
defeat of Omega Shenron,

14
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
the Eternal Dragon himself
appeared of his own free will.

15
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,708
What reasons does Shenron
have for this sudden visit?

16
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:16,208
Find out now, on the final
episode of Dragon Ball GT!

17
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,333
[SHENRON growls]

18
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,541
So Shenron appears before us
without being summoned?

19
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,333
That's never happened before.

20
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,875
I mean, I've never heard of him
doing this kind of thing.

21
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,083
Yeah, and doesn't the sky
usually cloud up and turn dark?

22
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:55,833
[SHENRON]
Now, arise, Goku.

23
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,916
Goku, you're alive!

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,416
Shenron? You're here?

25
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,625
So, all of the Shadow
Dragons are gone.

26
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:16,333
Yes. But do you know why they
ever had to appear at all?

27
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,541
Kind of...

28
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,625
The Dragon Balls were overused.

29
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,125
Following the barrage of
enemies from your past,

30
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,791
a final wish was made
causing the balls to crack

31
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,583
under the pressure of
their negative energy.

32
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,000
The Dragon Balls
were intended to be

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,083
a thing of extraordinary
magic and power.

34
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,000
Something to be revered, not
for the ease of their method,

35
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,250
but for the dream of
never having to use them.

36
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,208
I am afraid now
I must separate myself

37
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,291
and all of Earth from the
Dragon Balls for a long time.

38
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,666
I gotcha, but I was wondering
if, for old times sake,

39
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,916
you wouldn't mind listening

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,541
to just one more
little request I have.

41
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,166
One last time.

42
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,375
After the hole to
hell was opened,

43
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,000
the Earth had
no time to recover

44
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,791
before the Shadow Dragons
started destroying even more.

45
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,333
So many people have died.

46
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,833
If this is
anyone's fault, it's mine.

47
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,708
I take full responsibility.

48
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,708
I just wish that
the people of the world

49
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,041
didn't have to die for nothing.

50
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,375
The fight was never
theirs to win or lose,

51
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,750
but they all lost anyway.

52

[HERCULE whimpers]

is granted.

Thank you, Shenron.

[SHENRON] The time has come.
I must say goodbye.

Do you mean you're
leaving us for good now?

Are you coming along, Goku?

00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,833
Should have known
it would end this way.

Where are you going?

You're going to train, alone!

They're in your hands now.

Goodbye, everyone!

Goku, you're crazy.

71
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,833
You don't even know
where he's taking you!

72
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,166
It's been a long ride,
a lot of years.

73
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,833
I must have only been sixteen

74
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,750
when I first went looking
for the Dragon Balls

75
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,625
and stumbled into Goku.

76
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,750
The decades have
certainly seemed to fly by.

77

I'm gonna miss that guy.

Hey Shenron...

Before we get on our way,

80
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,625
there's a couple of guys
I'd like to stop in and see.

81
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,208
I love it when I get
someone else's mail.

82
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,916
I don't have to pay for these.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,083
Keeping those magazines

84
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,083
is the same thing
as stealing, ya know.

85
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,375
I don't see that keeping
you from reading them!

[yells]

I heard some turtles like me
can live a thousand years.

88
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,333
So, why're you
telling me this?

89
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,583
You're not even
close to that old.

90
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm just trying to
change the subject.

91

Hey, look! It's Goku!

92
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,458
Yeah, right.
That would be funny.

93
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,291
Isn't he dead?

94
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,541
No, really, it's him!

00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,958
I think the old man has
finally lost his mind.

I'd thought you'd
been killed for sure!

99
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,000
Or was I the one killed
and brought back to life?

[GOKU laughs]

101
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,916
You along with the rest
of the people on Earth.

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,666
It's so great to see you
guys again, I missed you.

103
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,000
You missed me? Aww...

104
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,666
So, you're still a kid, huh?

105
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,875
Yeah, but I won't mind it
when I'm an adult again.

106
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,083
The three of us here together
reminds me of old times.

107
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,500
Brings back a lot
of fun memories.

108
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,708
I remember we
had a bet one time.

109
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,625
We were supposed to
find a rock like this one

110
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,666
with a turtle on its back
and bring it back here.

111
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
Oh yeah, and the loser
had to go without dinner.

112
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,708
That's the worst way
to lose for me.

113
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,625
You and Master Roshi are
the only people I know

114
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,875
who haven't changed one bit

115
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,000
in all the years that
we've been friends.

116
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,250
I guess some people
never get old.

117
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,875
Unfortunately,
I'm not one of them.

118
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,333
Then let's fight.

119
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,500
I bet that will make
you feel young again.

120
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,833
Oh, yeah, right.

121
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,291
I'm old and you're still a kid.
It's hardly even.

122
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,333
You're gonna say no?

123
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, just don't
make me look too stupid.

124
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,791
Those boys'll never change.

125
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,083
You're old,
but you're still fast...

126
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,750
...and you still
pack quite a punch.

127
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,333
Nah, you're the better fighter.

128
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,916
I just have you beaten
hands down in good looks.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,750
Huh? Goku?

130
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:05,875
Goku, where did you run off to?
Hey! Where'd you go?!

131
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,458
Tell Shenron thanks
for the Dragon Balls, Goku.

132
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,375
And I hope your journey
brings you back home someday.

well with that guy!

you are doing here?!

Please tell me you
haven't died again.

Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

144
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,625
to send you back to Earth?

145
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,833
What are you doing?

146
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,083
I just came to say goodbye.

147
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,666
Well then, so be it.

148
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,083
You've always been there
for me when I've needed help.

149
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,166
You'll always be one
of my best friends.

150
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,041
Someday, you'll get out
of here, Piccolo. I promise.

151
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,375
What?

152
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,708
Farewell, old friend.

153
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:02,416
Hey, Goku! Are you gonna be
home by dinner time tonight?

154
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,833
Well, I had planned on making
a nice dinner just for him,

155
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,416
but I guess it's
take out food now.

156
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,791
Don't worry, Mom.

157
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,708
I'm sure he'll come back
if you're gonna cook dinner.

Just what were you planning
on making, by the way?

What's up, Pan?

170
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,083
I'm just wondering...
Is what Shenron said true?

171
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,833
Are we ever gonna see
the Dragon Balls again?

172
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,875
It's up to us to make sure
we don't ever need them again.

173
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,708
So from now on, we're gonna have
to focus all of our energy

00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,125
on preventing problems

175
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,708
rather than relying on
the Dragon Balls to solve them.

176

Once we are capable of that,

177

I have no doubt in my mind

178

that the Dragon Balls
will appear once again.
