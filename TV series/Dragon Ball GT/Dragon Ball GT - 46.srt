[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT...

He's still alive!

00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,083
[DR. MYUU]
Remarkable!

169
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,250
[SS4 GOKU] So, that's it,
huh? You've been feeding off

170
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,166
all of my attacks just like your
old counterpart, Android 19!

171
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,125
You know, guys like
you should learn to fight

172
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,625
with your own power!

173
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
If you had really
figured it out,

174
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,125
then why would you have
kept on attacking?

175
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,833
Are you really that dumb?

176
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,875
Wait and see! Someone
as brilliant as you

177
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
should know that I don't
give up without a fight!

178
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,791
I'll show you personally
what I'm capable of!

179

[DR. MYUU cackling]

180
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,625
I wish I could say
you had me worried.

181
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,000
I wasn't sure how
his body would respond

182
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,541
to absorbing that much
power all at once.

183
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,000
It seems that he is capable
of more than I even predicted.

184
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,125
My dream to construct
the ultimate machine mutant

185
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,416
has finally arrived.

186
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,708
[DR. MYUU] And now my dream has
become your worst nightmare!

Ha! Quit your daydreaming!

188
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,875
I honestly don't care
how strong you say he is!

189
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,833
Both of you are about to get
the wake up call of your lives!

190
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:50,333
So please, spare me
the small talk!

191
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:54,666
All right Super 17! I grow
tired of this macho banter.

192
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,375
Give the rotten
Saiyan what he wants!

193
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,416

[SS4 GOKU]
Wait a second! This won't work!

202
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,208
Any energy I use will
just make him stronger.

the best you can do?

No.

It's crazy, like he
knows exactly where

216
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,166
I'm going to appear,
before I even get there!

217
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,708
I'm sure that on a
more inferior opponent

218
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,375
that special move of
yours works rather well.

219
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,791
It's just one of the
perks of being an android

220
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,208
that I can sense the
vibrations in the atmosphere

at the point of your reentry.

where Goku will strike next,

[SS4 GOKU] From the looks of
whatever he's got brewing,

I know I'm gonna have
to get up and fight back.

227
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,958
I guess I should
come up with a plan.

228
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,000
I just can't lie
here and wait to die.

229

Giving up already?

230
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,541
[NARRATOR] Can Goku find the
strength to defend himself?

231
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,333
Or has the Super Saiyan Four

232
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,375
finally entered a battle
he can't finish?

233

next episode of Dragon Ball GT!
