[NARRATOR]
 Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,291
Goku, Trunks, and Pan

3
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,708
were attacked by a swarm
of carnivorous Mouma,

4
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,166
the only native life found
on the Asteroid Beehey!

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,625
But the giant beasts proved to
be no match for these Saiyans.

6
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,708
Soon thereafter they encountered
the Para Para Brothers,

7
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,916
whose extremely bizarre
"dance and attack" strategy

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
only worked for a short time.

9
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,916
Pan and Giru tried
to locate the Dragon Ball

10
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,083
hidden on the Para Para ship.

11
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,208
Not only were
they unsuccessful,

12
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,458
they were trapped on board

13
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,750
and launched
into unknown territory!

14
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,916
[PAN] Giru, can you
read this language?

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,250
[GIRU] Destination: Planet Luud.
Departure: Imminent.

16
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,875
Launch sequence initiated.

17
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,125
Will Goku and Trunks
regroup in time

18
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,375
to track them down
and save them?

19
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:16,125
Find out today
on Dragon Ball GT!

20
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,416
Atmosphere re-entry
process complete.

21
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,125
Now deactivating heat shields.

22
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:04,750
Caution: Restoring gravity
control in 3, 2, 1...

23
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,750
Giru. Giru. Giru head hurt!

24
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,833
Why didn't you tell me the
gravity was coming back on?!

25
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,333
Giru. Giru.

26
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,708
You're impossible.

27
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,583
Oh, no... This is
not a good situation.

28
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,666
We're in the wrong place
and nowhere near Grandpa.

29
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,625
Alright...

30
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,958
Giru.

31
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,958
Look, we both know
we don't get along.

32
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,375
So why don't we just put
aside our differences...

33
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,625
...and work as a team!

34
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,666
Pan. Pan. Danger! Danger!

35
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,625
"Danger-Danger"?
I'll show you danger!

36
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,250
"Danger" is what happens
to stupid little robots

37
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,041
who don't do what I tell them to
do, when I tell them to do it!

38
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,500
I'm all you've got out here,
buster, so you better shape up!

39
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,750
Got it?!

40
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,666
Of all the people to
get stranded with, why him?

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,250
Calm giru. Giru calm.

42
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,375
I don't understand
any of this...

43
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,583
It's just a bunch of
switches, lights and knobs...

44
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,125
Who am I kidding?

45
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,333
There's no way I'll be able
to fly this ship out of here!

46
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,375
Giru!

47
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,125
You sit right here, Giru...
Since you're a robot and all,

48
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,375
I figure you'll know
much more than I do

49
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,583
about how to pilot
this behemoth.

50
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,833
Giru... Doesn't know.

51
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,416
Don't give me that baloney!

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,250
You could at least try to look
at the controls and help out...

53
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,000
Either that, or I pound
you into scrap metal!

54
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,333
Searching.... Button identified!

55
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,125
Really?
That's the right button?

56
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,625
See! That wasn't so hard
now, was it, Giru?!

57
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,000
We're outta here!

58
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,166
Wrong button. Giru...

59
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,958
Boy... I hope Pan's okay...
Wherever she is.

60
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
Yeah... Me too.

61
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,125
Alright guys, listen up!

62
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,583
Tell me where your
spaceship went, right now!

63
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,500
I... I wish I knew!

64
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,791
Don't lie to me!

65
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,833
Okay, guys... Get ready.
Let's do this in E minor.

66
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,583
Aawww... Yeah!

67
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,583
One... two...
One two three four...

68
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,916
Don't think you can
deceive us like that again!

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,666
Now tell me!
Where did Pan go?!

70
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,666
One two. One two.
I just don't know.

71
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,666
One two. One two.
I just don't know.

72
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,250
One two. One two.

73
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,833
I just don't know anything about
setting the ship's auto-pilot

74
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,125
to return straight back
to our home Planet Luud.

75
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,125
Son Para!

76
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,875
Here we go!
This looks like a door!

77
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,416
Giru giru giru!

78
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,833
What did I do to deserve this?

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,625
Giru! Why are you always
causing trouble?! Ya jerk!

80
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,041
Giru Giru.

81
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,625
Where are we, Giru?

82
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:58,000
Unknown... Location unknown.
Consuming now.

83
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,041
Helpful as always, Giru!

84
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,416
These ships look like
the one we were in....

85
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Of course! This must be where
the Para Para Brothers are from!

86
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,625
Don't do that, Giru...
You almost scared me!

87
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,291
Discovery! Discovery!
Dragon Ball located!

88
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,833
What did you just say?!

89
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,041
Yeah, you're right.
There really is a Dragon Ball...

90
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,833
But I wonder what it's
doing all the way out here.

91
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,041
Duh! It makes total sense!

92
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,833
It's the Dragon Ball the
Para Para Brothers stole!

93
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,083
Of course...

94
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,833
They must have dropped
off the Dragon Ball here

95
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,500
before they went to Beehey!

96
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,750
That explains why
you and I couldn't find it

97
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,500
anywhere on
their ship... So...

98
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:54,250
According to this right here,
the Dragon Ball should be...

99
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,291
...down this way.

100
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,291
What is that?

101
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,541
Looks like a shrine or something

102
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,083
Danger!

103
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,958
What's wrong with you, Giru?
You've been acting up all day!

104
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,541
No! Danger! No!

105
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,250
Danger! Danger!

106
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,666
Danger!

107
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,250
Gee, for a shrine... this place
is a tad on the ugly side.

108
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,208
What do you
think you're doing?!

109
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,083
Fine... I'm going
after the Dragon Ball!

110
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,083
What? You're gonna let
a little girl like me

111
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,083
walk into certain
doom all by myself?

112
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,416
Danger! Danger!

113
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,416
How can you be so sure
there's danger in there?!

114
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,958
You haven't even been inside!

115
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,833
Danger! Danger! Danger! Danger!
Danger! Danger! Danger! Da-

116
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,875
Great! So tell me what it
is I need to watch for!

117
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,250
Danger! Caution! Caution!

118
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,916
Shut up, Giru! I can't
take it anymore...

119
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,875
I'll just have to find
it without your help!

120
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,416
Pan?

121
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,791
Danger, Pan! Danger! Danger!

122
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,500
Enyaka Yakayaka
Luud Rama Lama Sama...

123
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,250
What are those voices?

124
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,375
Enyaka Yakayaka
Luud Rama Lama Sama...

125
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,208
Looks like the door is locked.

126
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,791
Not scared, Pan... Not scared!

127
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,250
Now, my faithful believers...

128
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,375
The rebirth of our savior,
Lord Luud, is at hand.

129
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,375
You all must give
him your strength,

130
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,083
for it will be the source of
power in his resurrection!

131
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,500
Okay... Now I'm scared!

132
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,041
It's our Dragon Ball!

133
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,083
Not so fast, kid!

134
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,208
You're not goin' anywhere!

135
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,291
Well, we're here.

136
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,583
So this is Planet Luud, huh?

137
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,041
There's something eerie
about this place.

138
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,416
Come on, let's go guys!

139
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,166
Hey! Quit playing
around up there!

140
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,166
You're gonna pull your teeth
straight out of your jaw!

141
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,333
Nice one!

142
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,000
Why'd'ya hafta go 
and electrocute us?!

143
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,750
I just hope that the great and
wonderful Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy

144
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,208
hasn't seen us tied up
and crying like this!

145
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,458
Whatever he does to us,
it's gonna hurt so bad!

146
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,000
Giru giru giru giru...

147
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,041
Giru giru giru giru...

148
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,458
Giru giru giru giru...

149
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,333
Whoa!

150
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,916
Giru!

151
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,916
So it looks like
you're doing okay!

152
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,416
Pan pan pan pan pan pan!

153
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,458
What about Pan? Is she
in trouble or something?

154
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,625
Pan in danger! Pan in danger!

155
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,791
What's going on here?!

156
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,458
Hey, you! Over here!

157
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,666
You must be the boss!

158
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,041
Didn't your mother
ever teach you

159
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,958
what good manners
are all about?

160
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,875
It's not right to steal
other people's property!

161
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,416
Who would dare to--?

162
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,250
You have no idea how hard I
worked to get this Dragon Ball

163
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,916
from the people
of Planet Gelbo...

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,291
And you had
the nerve to take it!

165
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,333
How pathetic for a grown man

166
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,958
having to steal
from a little girl!

167
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,875
Oh, I know who you are.

168
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,041
Why don't you cough up
the other Dragon Ball

169
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,250
you have in your possession
before I start to get angry.

170
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,791
Uh, what Dragon Ball?

171
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,416
I can see through
your lies, little girl!

172
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,416
Now hand over the
four-star Dragon Ball!

173
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,375
Who do you think you are?

174
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,875
I am the famous
Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy.

175
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,666
I serve him, our great Deity
of Destruction, Lord Luud.

176
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,916
He will be resurrected with
the power of his followers

177
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,208
and your precious Dragon Balls!

178
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
For when Lord Luud is reborn,

179
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,541
he will destroy
the non-believers

180
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,041
in this unruly Universe,

181
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,625
and we, as his emissaries,
will rule over all!

182
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,416
Now hand over
the Dragon Ball, little girl.

183
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,458
I don't have the slightest clue

184
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,375
what you were just
babbling about!

185
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,041
But I do know that this is
the Dragon Ball I came for,

186
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,875
so I'll be leaving
now... Okay? Bye bye!

187
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,333
Hey! Stop!
You're not going anywhere!

188
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,041
What the--?

189
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,458
That's what you get for
not obeying my orders.

190
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,333
What's wrong with me?

191
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,041
I can't move my arms or
legs! I'm frozen still!

192
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,166
Oh, Grandpa, where are you?!

193
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,166
It looks like this girl didn't
have the Dragon Ball after all.

194
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,125
Oh, well. I'm sure
I can still use her.

195
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,958
Lord Luud, you will enjoy this
little girl's Saiyan power.

196
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,833
Eenyaka-Yaka-yaka--

197
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,375
All right, now I'm
starting to get worried...

198
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
I'm still not sensing
Pan's energy anywhere!

199
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,291
Hey, Pan! Where are you?!

200
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
Why are you fools all tied up?

201
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,958
Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy!

202
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,250
Have you three
failed me once again?

203
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,000
Uh... You see...

204
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,041
We uh, brought back
the, uhhh, you know...

205
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
The Dragon Ball!
We have it here!

206
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,541
So do you expect me to
say you did a good job?

207
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,375
Because you haven't!

208
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,416
What the--?!

209
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,916
Danger! Danger!

210
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,041
Now wait! Those guys
were on your side, right?

211
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,166
So why would you
do that to them?

212
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,875
What do you mean why?

213
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,958
I just did them a favor by
fusing them with Lord Luud.

214
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,333
They'll be of much better
service to him now,

215
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,208
rather than dancing
and prancing around

216
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,125
like a bunch of
show-tune obsessed idiots!

217
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,791
Lord Luud?

218
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,958
The Para Para
Brothers did exactly

219
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,416
what I sent them out to do,

220
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,541
which was to bring
you Saiyans to me.

221
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,583
So if you want to
live to see tomorrow,

222
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,666
you'll give me what I want!

223
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,916
I don't think so!

224
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,041
Now hand over the Dragon
Ball you stole from us!

225
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,958
You're making Lord
Luud very angry,

226
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,250
so give him what he wants!

227
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,208
No way!

228
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,333
You'll never get it!

229
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,041
Oh, is that so?

230
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,083
You leave me no choice.

231
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,750
I'll just pry it from
your cold dead hands!

232
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,916
You wish!

233
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,833
What's that?!

234
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,416
Hey! Why don't
you try fighting fair!

235
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,583
Fair? I don't even know what
that word means, you brat!

236
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
You're a quick one, aren't you?!

237
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,791
Goku!

238
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,250
It's gonna take a lot more
than a gun to stop me!

239
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,916
Lord Luud teaches us how to win
a battle by any means necessary.

240
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,125
And that's exactly what
I plan on doing to you!

241
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,625
I won't stop until you're dead!

242
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,250
Giru! Danger ahead! Big danger!

243
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,750
Run away giru!

244
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,750
You both know it's
worthless to fight now!

245
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,708
My Leon here will take care
of you two in no time,

246
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,166
so surrender or die!

247
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,500
Trunks! Grandpa!
It's me, Pan! Help me!

248
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,291
Giru run away! Giru run away!

249
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:59,458
Giru, I'm over here!
Come save me!

250
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,791
Oh, you better hope I
don't come out of this,

251
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,791
because if I do,
you are going to pay!

252
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,125
Run away! Run.... Giru?

253
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,875
Yes, Giru! It's me! It's Pan!

254
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,500
Signs of life present.
Signs of life present... Pan!

255
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,833
Right! You're right
Giru, it is me!

256
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,500
No!

257
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,291
Major malfunction.

258
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,583
Hey, you all right?

259
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,166
I'm fine... Sorry about being
off guard back there...

260
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,750
W-What?

261
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,708
I must admit that
you two have some skill.

262
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,083
But don't pat yourselves
on the back for taking out

263
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,250
Cardinal Mutchy-Mutchy,
for he's only a part of me!

264
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,333
He... He must have 
a cloaking device!

265
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,000
Now that's funny!

266
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,958
Tell you what, I'll save you the
tension and show my true form!

267
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,916
We... should've seen
that one coming!

268
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,541
Yeah, no kidding! What are you?!

269
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,416
You may call me Mutchy...
Lord Luud's right hand man!

270
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,958
The mysterious
Cardinal Mutchy-Mutchy

271
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,541
has revealed his true form.

272
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,125
And this tentacled threat

273
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,250
is all that stands in the way
of recovering the Dragon Balls

274
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:46,583
and saving Pan from
a fate worse than death!

275
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:52,250
The plot thickens on
the next Dragon Ball GT!
