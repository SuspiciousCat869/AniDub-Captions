00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,416
Goku, Pan, and Trunks made
their return to mother Earth.

3
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
Hi, you guys! We made it!

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,166
[NARRATOR]
Disaster had been averted

5
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,375
and the Black Star
Dragon Balls were left

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,875
in the capable hands
of Mister Popo.

7
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,708
[GOKU] We'll see ya soon!
[PAN] Bye Giru!

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,875
[NARRATOR] The weary travelers
thought they'd be returning

9
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,666
to the safety of their homes,

10
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,875
but they were not prepared for
what surprises were in store.

11
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,500
And the long awaited
family reunion

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,541
descended into a bitter
fight for survival.

13
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,541
[GOTEN]
You Saiyans!

14
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,541
[GOHAN]
It's been a while.

15
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,458
[NARRATOR] Mother had
turned against daughter,

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,500
and sons against their father!

17
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,583
Taking the two attackers
as evil imposters,

18
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,083
Goku made up his
mind to destroy them!

19
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,791
Goku! Stop it!

20
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,791
Mr. Satan?

21
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,333
[HERCULE] Goku! Baby is
controlling Gohan and Goten!

22
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,000
He got in their heads
and jacked up their minds!

23
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,250
The entire human race
is under Baby's control!

24
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,083
[GOKU]
How could I let this happen?

25
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,375
[NARRATOR] At last,
Goku knew the whole truth.

26
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,875
In his absence, darkness
had taken over the Earth!

27
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,666
[GOKU]
Not you, Vegeta!

28
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,791
[NARRATOR] With Baby in control
of Vegeta and his own two sons,

29
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,083
Goku now faces an enemy
of unparalleled strength!

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,666
But how can the loyal Saiyan
attack his parasitic foe

31
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,041
without destroying the
bodies of the ones he loves?

32
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,833
[HERCULE] Go back to where
you came from, you vermin!

33
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,833
You're not welcome here!
Find your own bodies!

34
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,708
[BABY VEGETA] I thought
that we had infiltrated

35
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,875
all of the human life forms
on this miserable planet.

36
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,416
How we overlooked the
loud one, I do not know!

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,291
I'll tell ya how,
Baby! I was hidin'!

38
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,708
Right in here!
And you never knew!

39
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,500
Funny, huh? We used
the same strategy!

40
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,791
[HERCULE] Except I didn't go
inside of Majin Buu to lay eggs,

41
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,166
I went inside of him
to hide from you!

42
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,416
How do ya like them apples?

43
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,333
[GOKU laughing]

44
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,083
Wow! Great idea, Mr. Satan!

45
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,291
[HERCULE laughing]

46
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,708
All right! It's time you were
told what's what around here!

47
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,250
I'm the Champion of the world!

48
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,083
You got that, Baby?!
You're nothin' to me!

49
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,375
You're a joke! That's why
I have Goku on the job!

50
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,916
He takes care of the small fish
and leaves the big ones to me!

51
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,916
I see! I misjudged you.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,750
I thought you were
an ordinary man.

53
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,916
Now that I know you're
Earth's champion...

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,458
...you're history!

55
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,333
Uh...

56
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:25,333
[HERCULE yelping]

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,750
[HERCULE yelping]
I knew my mouth

58
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,083
would get me killed one day!

59
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,708
Buu! Get Pan to safety!

60
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,250
Okay!

61
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,916
Goku! Don't hold back! Hit him
with everything I taught ya!

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,791
Hey, Baby! Thought you
could outwit the Champ!

63
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,708
Didn't ya, big guy?

64
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:04,625
[HERCULE laughing]

65
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:10,958
Buu! I-It's not time yet!
What are you doing? Aaaah!

66
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,166
Yummy! Good! Good! Buuuuuuu!

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,166
He's all mine!

68
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,500
Enough!

69
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,583
[BABY VEGETA] No need to
waste your energy on them!

70
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,500
This little prize is
the only one worth having!

71
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,625
When he falls, it's over!

72
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,500
So tell me, do you really think

73
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:36,583
you'll be able to do serious
harm to your own two sons?

74
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,833
Hm! You tell me! Will I?

You won't get away with this!

78
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,791
My friends and I will
find a way to stop you!

79
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,291
Fool! You Saiyans
wiped out my race!

80
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,583
This is merely payback!

81
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,750
But this is Earth! The Saiyans
were destroyed long ago!

82
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,291
They've already
paid for their actions!

83
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
Now so will you!

he couldn't even stand to be
inside a Super Saiyan body!

is a quick learner!

Oh, boy. Bad timing.

[GOKU] It's not safe
for Bulla to be here!

98
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,125
Baby got to Earth
before we did, Trunks!

99
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,791
He's taken over your Dad's body

100
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,958
just like he tried
to take over yours!

have been infected too!

think you can resist, Goku?

Gosh, Trunks. You, too?

104
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,958
Don't fret. It's actually
a pretty cool feeling!

105

No worries, no
pressures, no cares!

106

You'll enjoy it, Goku!
Let go of all that tension!

Yeah! Go with the
flow! It's so easy!

Fight, Trunks!

109

[BABY VEGETA] Trunks is a
Tuffle. Now he sees clearly.

It's you!

111

You're like a drop
of oil in water, Goku!

We are a team! You are
but one individual!

part of something great!

There's no way that you can win.

He's right, Dad. You'll
die if you fight back!

that actually.

00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,958
would prove more challenging.

159
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,875
No! My body! It can't
take it! It's too weak!

160
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,125
My older body was more
developed, and more resilient!

161
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,708
What am I gonna do now?

162
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,208
[BABY VEGETA]
It looks like your time is up!

163
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,958
Now die, Saiyan scum!

[GOKU]
Did I miss something funny?

167
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,458
Because if you think you've won,
then the joke's on you!

168
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,833
This fight won't be over until
you've been destroyed!

169
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,375
Even if you manage to kill
me, someone else will come

170
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,666
and take my place! Some
how! Some way!

Believe what you want.

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,125
I believe in what I
can see and touch.

Now, that's real!
Feel it? Pain is real,

177
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,666
and there's only one way out!

[GOKU groans]

179
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,541
[BABY VEGETA] You'll find
it to be much less painful

180
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,875
if you stay down.

181
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,541
I'll end it quickly.

00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,666
Thanks, Baby, but
I prefer to fight!

00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,000

your way then, Saiyan!

That should do it!

Well, I'm not dead yet!
Good try though!

[BABY VEGETA growls]

00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,125
Look. Baby. Stop this.
It's not too late.

197
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,833
For your own good!

198
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,416
Hm! My own good?

199
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,625
You're at death's door and
you're worried about me?

200
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,125
That's awfully touching!

201
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,708
[BABY VEGETA]
Perhaps your ancestors

202
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,333
should have demonstrated
such compassion

203
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,875
before they destroyed my race!

204
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,250
That would have been
nice, wouldn't it?

205
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,125
But they chose to kill instead.

206
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,333
And now, I must choose!

207
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,250
You die! That's my choice!

208
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,625
Now! Slaves!
Give me your energy!

Thanks to your
collective Saiyan powers,

00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,416
a Tuffle is now the strongest
being in the Universe!

Amazing, but true.

You're the best, the

doesn't always go

going to beat me?

it out eventually!

finally met your match?
