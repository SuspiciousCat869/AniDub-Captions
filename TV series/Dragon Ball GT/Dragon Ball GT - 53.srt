[NARRATOR]
On the last episode of GT...

2
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,958
the earthquake-loving
Naturon Shenron

3
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,500
was reducing the cities
of Earth to rubble.

00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,625
Though unsightly in form,

5
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,250
the Seven-Star Dragon was not
without his special talents!

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,541
[NATURON SHENRON]
See that?

7
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,916
That's what I like to call
the Aftershock Technique.

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,125
No one can handle a concentrated
blast of energy from below.

9
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,125
Everyone gets blown away!

10
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,041
[NARRATOR] But Naturon Shenron's
earthbound techniques

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,375
proved to be ineffective against
his airborne adversaries!

12
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,875
[NATURON SHENRON]
What's wrong with you?

13
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,750
Why do you keep
making fun of me?

14

[NARRATOR]
Outwitted and demoralized,

17
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,958
the giant Mole Dragon
went down for the count!

18
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,750
And when he coughed up
the Seven-Star Dragon Ball,

19
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,708
it seemed like the battle
had been won at last!

[PAN]
The Seven-Star Ball is ours!

21
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,625
[NARRATOR] But Naturon Shenron
was far from beaten!

22
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,416
The conniving dragon had simply

23
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,458
saved his deadliest
attack for last!

[NARRATOR]
Goku could only watch in horror

27
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,375
as Pan was sucked into
Naturon's deadly trap!

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,833
Stretched and disfigured,

29
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,833
the young beauty was
becoming part of the beast!

30
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,625
It was a nightmarish
sight to behold.

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:46,041
Pan and the Shadow Dragon
were one and the same!

32
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,708
[NATURON SHENRON]
Time to start the next round!

Giru! Giru! Giru!

The power you had
earlier has all but vanished.

35
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,541
Why don't you turn back
into the red monkey

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
and we'll really get
this party started.

[NARRATOR]
Bolstered by Pan's strength,

38
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,125
Naturon Shenron was more
dangerous than ever!

39
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,541
Can Goku counter attack
without hurting Pan?

00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,625
[GIRU] Goku, run! Pan,
mad! Extreme danger!

315
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,916
Extreme danger! Run!

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,333
[GOKU laughing]

317
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,666
[PAN laughing]

318
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,291
[NARRATOR] After surviving
the scare with Naturon,

319
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,583
Pan and Goku fly
into the unknown,

320
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,750
ready to face one
of the three dragons

321
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,916
that are still
roaming the Earth!

322
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,833
Hatched from decades of
accumulated negative energy,

323
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,083
there's no way of knowing

324
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,416
what monstrous potential
these dragons possess.
