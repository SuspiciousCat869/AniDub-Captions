be dead! I killed you!

165
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,875
Just die!

166
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,583
King Kai? King Kai,
can you hear me?

167
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,875
I hear you loud and clear, Goku.

168
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,750
You're doing a great job, buddy.

169
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,208
Remember to use the
attack that I taught ya!

170
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
You remember, right?

171
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,625
[GOKU] It's not gonna
be that easy though!

172
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,291
[OMEGA]
Die! Die! Die! Die!

173
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,250
[GOKU] I've already used
all of Earth's energy,

174
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,166
and this spirit bomb still isn't
powerful enough to finish him!

175
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,208
I'll need to borrow from the
entire universe for it to work.

176
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,333
King Kai, call to everyone you
can and gather their energy.

177
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,000
It's our only hope!

178
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,625
Pep from the
entire universe, eh?

179
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,041
That's a fantastic idea!

180
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,708
[GOKU] Please King Kai, I need
everyone you can possibly get!

181
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,708
[KING KAI] Okay!
Leave it to me, Goku!

182
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,708
[KING KAI] Kais of the East,
South, and West!

183
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,083
Lend me your strength,

184
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,666
for the fate of the people
of Earth depends on it!

185
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,916
Everybody! Give me
all of your energy!

186
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Bon para para para.

187
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,958
Bon Pappa!

188
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,416
That voice...

189
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,000
Sounded like...

190
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,083
...Goku's!

191
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,500
[GOKU] Come on!
Raise your hands in the air!

192
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,750
You know the drill,
so dance with us!

193
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,666
Shake your rump...

194
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,583
...and put 'em up!

195
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,416
--What was that?
--Oh! Wow!

196
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,125
It's energy from all
over the universe!

197
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,583
I can sense this one
is from the Imeccians,

198
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
and another from
the villagers of Gelbo!

199
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,541
It's Grandpa!

200
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,833
King Kai, thank you so much,

201
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,833
and thank the citizens
of the Universe!

202
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,833
Enough!

203
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,750
Impossible!
How did he do that?

204
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,666
Grandpa!

205
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,791
Look at that!
Isn't it beautiful?

206
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,041
This is it!

207
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,583
Wait, Wait! Hold on!

208
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:47,375
[GOKU yells]

209
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:56,041
[OMEGA whimpers]

210
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,208
[OMEGA yells]

211
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
Dad!

212
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,875
Goku!

213
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,458
Goku, where are you?

214
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,583
Hey, Dad!

215
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,375
Goku!

216
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,291
Show yourself, Kakarot!

217
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,500
Grandpa!

218
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,416
Grandpa, wake up!
Can you hear me?

219
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,750
Look at the Dragon Balls!

220
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,541
[SHENRON growls]

221
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,833
Wait a minute!

222
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,500
What's Shenron doing here?
We didn't call him.

223
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,708
[NARRATOR] With a Spirit Bomb
of universal scale,

224
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,416
Goku was finally able
to defeat Omega Shenron!

225
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
Then, suddenly,
without warning or summoning,

226
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,083
the Eternal Dragon himself
appeared in the sky above them,

227
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,083
restored to his
previous majesty.

228
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,916
What does Shenron's
unprompted appearance mean?

229
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,166
Strange occurrences
await Goku and the others

230
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,583
next time on the final
episode of Dragon Ball GT!
