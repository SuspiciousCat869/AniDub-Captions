Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,833
Pan and Giru were trapped on the
Para Para Brothers' spaceship,

3
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,375
and heading straight
for the Planet Luud.

[PAN] But I do know that this is
the Dragon Ball I came for,

[NARRATOR] Pan thought taking
back the Six-Star Dragon Ball

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
was an easy steal,

9

29
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,458

164
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,333
[BELIEVER  B] Is it true that
Master Dolltaki will

165
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,041
make an appearance today?

166
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,416
[BELIEVER C]
I hope it's true.

167
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,791
I arrived here when I
was 52 years old,

168
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,166
and now I'm 75, and I still
haven't laid eyes on him.

169
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,333
[BELIEVER D] I heard that
he last appeared 25 years ago,

170
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,166
and that thousands
of miracles followed him.

171
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,500
[BELIEVER E] This will
be my first time to see him too.

172
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,541
I've always pictured
him to be eight feet tall

173
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,333
with long, white hair.

174
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,583
I can't wait to meet him!

175
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,375
[BELIEVER C] Ohh, my back
will not stop throbbing!

176
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,750
I can barely walk now.

177
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,833
I hope Master Dolltaki will
have the time to fix it.

178
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,375
[BELIEVER F] And I hope he'll
cure these broken legs of mine!

179
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,458
[BELIEVER G] Oh, please
Master Dolltaki...

180
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,583

Master Dolltaki is coming!

00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,083

[DOLLTAKI] It's been too long
since I was last with you...

186
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,916
For those of you who have never
met me, I am Master Dolltaki,

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,250
the leader of the Luud Order...
and Speaker of the Word!

188

[BELIEVERS cheering]

189

[DOLLTAKI]
My believers!

190
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,916
Your efforts thus far to
resurrect Lord Luud

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,541
have not gone unnoticed,

192
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,375
and He will soon repay you all
for the sacrifices you've given.

193
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,041
This momentous day calls
for a celebration...

194
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,083
Because after tonight, the need
for an Oracle to communicate

195
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,250
with our Lord
will not be needed.

196
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,333
I received
the last Oracle today.

197
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,458
It informed me that Luud will
be returning very soon...

198
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,541
That his
resurrection is complete!

[BELIEVERS murmuring]

200
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,833
[DOLLTAKI]
And I received something else...

201
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,833
A personal message
from Lord Luud

202
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,666
to every member of the Order!

203
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,375
[BELIEVERS cheering]

204
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,625
[DOLLTAKI] His message asks
for every believer

205
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,250
to give him life
in this world...

206
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,833
The only way to this end,

207
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,583
is by giving your own lives in
exchange for Luud's salvation!

208
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,583
[BELIEVERS hestitantly
murmuring]

209
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,333
[DOLLTAKI] I needn't remind you
of what an honor this is.

210
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,875
To be fused with Lord Luud,
is to live for eternity!

--Did he say give our own lives?

213
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,208
[DOLLTAKI]
You must let go of your fears,

214
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
and allow yourselves to be part

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,166
of a glorious
Kingdom under Luud.

216
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,708
Your bodies
are nothing but shells now,

217
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,166
holding back your spirit

218
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,500
from serving your true
purpose in the Order.

[DOLLTAKI cackling]

222
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,583
[DOLLTAKI] Now... Hear me,

223
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:39,583
Serve your final purpose as we
re-awaken our sleeping Lord!

[BELIEVER E]
That can only mean one thing!

That Lord Luud isn't the Savior
we thought it was...

He's just a machine!

[DOLLTAKI] You're right!
You caught me red-handed!

The collective electrical energy
gathered from your bodies

233

will be more than
enough to raise Luud!

never noticed this before!

00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,083
of the energy that
I had expected.

320
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,875
Though I do have enough
power to boot up his systems

321
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,500
and get him
on his feet and moving.

322
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,541
Very soon, Luud,
you and I will rule!

323
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,541
The entire universe
should beware...

324
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,791
If someone pushes me,
I'll keep pushing back

325
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,916
until they're dead!

326
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,291
[PAN] He's got a surprise
in store

327
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,625
if he thinks he
can kill Grandpa.

328
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
[DOLLTAKI]
I'm sorry... my Panny...

329
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,333
I'll have to change
your clothes later...

330
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,125
In the meantime,
and I know it's hard,

331
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,541
just try to deal with those
sad clothes you have now.

332
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,166
[TRUNKS]
It's so quiet here.

333
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,833
I wonder where all those
people went?

334
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,333
I hope Pan's all right.

335
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,000
A doll?

336
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,083
[GOKU laughing]
Trunks!

337
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,416
Look at what I found!
That was easy, huh?

338
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,458
[BOTH laughing]

339
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,541
[DOLLTAKI] Put the Dragon Ball
down now and step away!

340
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,458
[GOKU]
Yeah, right! Who are you?!

341
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,083
[DOLLTAKI]
I am Master Dolltaki...

342
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,291
Leader of the Luud
Order, at your service.

343
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,166
[TRUNKS]
Leader of the Order?

344
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,291
[DOLLTAKI]
That's right...

345
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,958
You wouldn't happen
to be looking for

346
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,333
a little girl named
Pan, would you?

347
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,000
Because I think
she wants to say hello.

348
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,250
[GOKU flailing]
That's Pan?!

349
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,583
[TRUNKS]
Pan! Are you okay?!

350
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:23,458
[PAN] Grandpa! Trunks! Help me!
Get me out of here!

351
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,750
[DOLLTAKI] Your suspicions
are undoubtedly correct...

352
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,916
This is indeed Pan...

353
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,500
And she's gonna live with
me forever and ever.

354
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,375
[GOKU]
Over my dead body!

355
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,541
[DOLLTAKI] You'll soon realize
that trying to get her back

356
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,750
will only get you killed,

357
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,583
and if that happens,
you'd better plan on...

358
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,333
...spending the rest of
eternity inside of Luud!

359
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,375
[BOTH grumble]

360
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:52,291
[beam humming]
[DOLLTAKI laughing]

361
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,083
[BOTH grumble]

362
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,125
[water bubbling]

363
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:06,416
[DOLLTAKI] Now arise, Luud!
Arise and fulfill your destiny!

364
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,041
[GIRU]
Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru!

365
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,583
[GOKU grunts]

366
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:30,625
[rock crumbling]

367
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:33,333
[NARRATOR] Master Dolltaki
has finally succeeded

368
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,666
in resurrecting Luud,

369
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,916
but will this giant's
power be enough

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,250
to defeat the likes
of Goku and Trunks...

371
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:45,041
and allow Dolltaki to keep Pan's
doll for the rest of eternity?

372
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:50,958
Watch the stunning conclusion
on the next Dragon Ball GT!
