[NARRATOR]
On the last GT,

2
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,416
the true objective of Doctor
Myuu's evil experiments

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,833
was discovered.

4
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,958
The fiendish physician had
been gathering life force

5
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,083
for the creation of Baby--
the ultimate mutant machine.

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,875
But thanks to Trunks and Giru,

7
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,791
the Neo-Mutant seemed
to have perished

8
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,833
in it's embryonic state.

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,625
[DR. MYUU] The Galaxy
is yours for the taking!

10
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:39,125
Live Baby! Please!
Your my only baby! My only...

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:44,541
Don't leave me. 
Please don't leave me.

12
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,291
[NARRATOR]
Defying premature death,

13
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,208
Baby entered the world
with a vengeance!

14
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,500
Trunks! Pan! Now!

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,041
My Baby. Every time I hear
that it makes my insides

16
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,666
boil so much I want to explode.

17
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,041
You are nothing but
a simple machine mutant.

18
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,583
For it was I who
programmed you to gather the

19
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,791
energy needed for
my resurrection.

20
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,458
And it was I who gave you
the plans for creating Luud

21
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,208
and the other machine mutants!

22
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,583
Yet, you had no idea,
you feeble shell of a machine!

23
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,166
Your time on
this planet is over!

24
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,875
[NARRATOR] A true monster was
born and it had Goku, Pan,

25
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,666
and Trunks in it sights!

26
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,375
My time is just beginning.

27
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,916
I know three
disgusting creatures

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,958

They won't be expecting me.

All right! Good work, Giru.
It looks brand new again!

31
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,916
[PAN] I don't think
it ever looked this shiny

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,291

00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,083
It really is pretty.

Dragon Balls, here we come!

I know this is your home Giru,
but when your home stinks,

40
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,208
it's best to just
find another one!

41

You're okay about
that, aren't you?

42
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
[GIRU]
Absolutely! Giru, Giru.

43
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,291
Great! Now let's go get
the Dragon Balls back!

You defective piece

Wake up, Rilldo!
Don't you get it?

Myuu doesn't care about you!

He thinks you're inferior!
He'll exterminate you, as well!

But if he didn't
do it, then who did?

You guys think too much!

We can sit and wonder about it

[TRUNKS]
It's not the bikes!

192

We're not moving because
we're being pulled in
