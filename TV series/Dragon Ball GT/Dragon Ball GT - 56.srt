Previously on Dragon Ball GT...

00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,666
the fight between the
small alliance of Saiyans

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,458
and the evil Four-Star Dragon

undaunted persistence.

knocked out by a Solar Flare?

Alright then! Let's get real!

So, Super Saiyan Four,

you've come out.
Let's play.

[NARRATOR]
Amidst all this turmoil,

16
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,208
Nuova Shenron transformed
into a better self.

17
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,833
And Goku knew that
only a Super Saiyan Four

18

could compete with this dragon.

19

But nearby, a new threat
is bearing down on Pan,

20
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
and it doesn't plan
on stopping there.

Stay tuned. It's all coming your
way today on Dragon Ball GT!

I'm quite impressed...

It didn't take you very long
to get used to your new form.

It's only new to you.

Of course not, I just
explore every angle.

in that block of ice,

161
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,500
totally open to any attack
we want to unleash on him?

162
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,625
All it will take is
one finishing attack.

163
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,708
He will be blown
into so many pieces

164
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,625
they'll have trouble
finding them all.

165

[EIS SHENRON]
What are you waiting for?

166
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,166
I'm giving you
the chance to kill Goku

167
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,958
and you're just standing
there like a statue!

168
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,833
It may be hard for you to
believe, but I'm not like you.

169
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,958
I refuse to kill anyone
when they are defenseless.

170
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,833
It's part of my code.

171
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,666
I didn't ask for you to
show up and help me.

172
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,083
I could have beaten
him on my own.

173
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,291
With my own techniques...

174
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,125
...and my own strength.

175
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,500
What a loser.

176
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,625
[BOTH grunting]

177
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,875
All of that childish
nonsense you spout

178
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,125
makes it sounds like
you have a conscience.

179
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:40,583
[BOTH grunting]

180
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,833
Just look at you, lying
face down in the dirt,

181
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,458
unable to fight
your own brother.

182
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,791
I'm ashamed to
even call you that!

183
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,750
Prove to me you're
a worthy fighter.

184
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
Stop acting like a weakling.

185
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,416
Bring honor to
the Shadow Dragons!

186
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,833
Kill him before I kill you.

187
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,541
[EIS SHENRON]
Well?

188
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,875
I understand.

189
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,458
[SS4 GOKU]
Nuova Shenron! Wait!

[BOTH grunting]

192
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,333
I'm quite impressed.

193
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,208
It didn't take you very long
to get used to your new form.

194
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,250
It's only new to you.

195
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,916
Let's go, while we're young!

196

Nova Star!

197

Oh great!

[SS4 GOKU sighs]

201
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,750
I told you to kill him,
not melt him, you imbecile!

202
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,291
Hey, Eis Shenron.

203
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,500
I've been listening to
you belittle your brother

204
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,958
because of his morals.

205
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,291
Don't you understand that
it's going to take his help

206
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,791
if you ever plan
on defeating me?

207
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,375
What are you getting at?

208
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,125
Give me ten seconds, Nuova.

209
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,958
I'll do away with your
hardheaded brother here,

210
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,083
then we can finish our
fight monkey to dragon,

211
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,375
like it should be.

212
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,041
So, you ready?

213
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,791
Ten seconds? You must have me
confused with someone else!

[EIS SHENRON growling]

[NARRATOR] As sibling
rivalry keeps Nuova and Eis

218

from executing a
combined attack on Goku,

219

Eis decides to
prepare his own attack

220
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,791
by freezing the entire city.

221
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:29,291
Does Goku have it in him to
finish off two Shadow Dragons?
