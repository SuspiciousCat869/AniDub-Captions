1
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,625
[NARRATOR] The battle between
Meta-Rilldo and Goku rages on.

2
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,458
The Space-Time trans-what?

3
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,541
[SCHOLAR BOT] The Space-Time
Transmission Machine on the top

4
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,458
floor runs all systems,
including Coersive Removal.

5
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,500
That means it's got to be
the Space-Time Machine

6
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,750
that sent Trunks
to Dr. Myuu's place.

7
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,916
I've got to
find that machine!

8
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,875
[SCHOLAR BOT]
But, it's dangerous!

9
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,291
[NARRATOR] Then Meta-Rilldo
underwent further transformation

10
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,291
and proved himself to be
a master of metamorphosis!

11
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,375
[RILLDO] Have you put it
together yet, Saiyan?

12
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,625
The mighty Meta-Rilldo is
not just a superior fighter,

13
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,791
but part of this
very planet itself.

14
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,625
I thought so.

15
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,166
[GOKU]
There!

16
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:23,583
You've got abilities, but
you haven't quite mastered them.

17
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,833
If I were judging you off
appearance, I'd call you a liar.

18
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,333
And it seems that you've
already forgotten

19
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,125
the most important
point of all.

20
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,291
[RILLDO] You can
fight me all you want...

21
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,625
...but until you rid this planet
of all the metal covering it,

22
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,375
I will always have a
body to bring to the battle.

23
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,750
Now, this is the part
where you hand yourself

24
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,875
and the other Saiyan
over to Dr. Myuu.

25
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,125
[RILLDO]
I wonder if this kid

26
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,666
has anything else
hidden up his sleeve?

27
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,916
[GOKU] This guy's gotta have
a weak spot somewhere.

28
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,083
[battle crys]

29
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,416
[crash]

30
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,833
[exsperated breathing]

31
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,500
[RILLDO] Where are you,
you Saiyan brat?

32
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,166
It's useless to hide from me!

33
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,333
Now come out!

34
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,500
[girl screams]

35
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,625
Take this!

36
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,958
This is pretty funny
from down here, Rilldo!

37
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,916
You look just like
the monster on the screen!

38
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,375
Is he your twin brother?!

39
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,708
Yummy! That is good!

40
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,583
[RILLDO] I'm getting tired of
playing around with you, boy.

41
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,916
But I'm just getting warmed up!

42
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,208
You little brat!

43
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,250
That's good!

44
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,666
[GOKU]
Hey! I'm over here!

45
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,666
[GOKU]
This way, shiny!

46
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,916
[RILLDO] So, shall you hide like
a coward or fight like a Saiyan?

47
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,291
Or are they one and
the same? Show yourself!

48
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,000
[PAN]
Grandpa!

49
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,416
I found the rest of
the Dragon Balls,

50
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,291
but Dr. Myuu has
taken Trunks hostage!

51
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,458
Pan! Stay where you are!

52
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,833
[screams]

53
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,083
[RILLDO]
Give me the Dragon Balls!

54
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,958
[PAN]
Grandpa!

55
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,791
Pan, no!

56
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,416
[PAN]
Wha, what's happening?

57
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,833
[evil chuckle]

58
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,708
[GIRU] Success!
Giru, Giru. Success!

59
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,750
Set the Space-Time
Transmission machine.

60
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
Yes sir. Right away sir!

61
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,000
[GIRU] Dr. Myuu very
impressed, very happy!

62
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,708
Hurry up with 
the next transmission!

63
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,541
[GIRU]
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

64
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,458
[GIRU]
Giru silent. Watch mouth.

65
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,708
[RILLDO] Perfect!
No one can stop us now.

66
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,666
[DR. MYUU] Have the other two
been delivered yet?

67
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,208
[PEON ROBOT] Yes Doctor. They're
still warm from the machine.

68
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,875
Oh. Three Saiyan's and
a Dragon Ball. Wunderbar!

69
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,208
Let's start right away on
the molecular restructuring!

70
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,375
[DR. MYUU]
Now let's see...

71
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,666
[maniacal laughter]

72
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,416
I can actually feel the
intensity of their Saiyan power.

73
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,916
[DR. MYUU] I have waited
ages for this moment!

74
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:37,500
Begin the molecular
restructuring operation. Now!

75
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,083
[chuckling]

76
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,666
[DR. MYUU]
Ah, T-Twenty-O-Six.

77
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,041
Good timing
my little robotic friend.

78
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,750
I was just about to start
cooking up the Saiyans.

79
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,166
[GIRU]
Bad news! Giru.

80
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,833
[DR. MYUU] Very soon
the true value of their power

81
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,500
will become clear.

82
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:11,541
Achtung! Since you've done
such an excellent job for me,

83
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,875
I will allow you to view
this momentous occasion,

84
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,250
the catapult for
every day to come!

[GIRU]
Move it Rusty!

87
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,250
[GIRU] Which is
the main off switch?

88
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,625
[DR. MYUU] What?
What are you doing?

89
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,916
[GIRU]
Giru just helping, sir.

90
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,166

Don't worry. We'll save you.

[GIRU] My friends are safe!
Giru succeed!

96
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:07,125
Stop! Stop that! Do you
hear me T-Twenty-O-Six?!

97
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:13,916
How dare you betray me
when I am your creator!

98
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,041
[GIRU] Betray? Giru, Goku,
Pan, Trunks, friends.

99
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,166
[GIRU]
All good friends.

100
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,208
Wha-- What?

101
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,625
[GIRU] Dr. Myuu, no friend of
Giru. No friend. Enemy.

[GIRU]
Giru, Giru, Giru.

This...
This can't be.

You've been working
for them the whole time!

Oh, my whole body
feels as stiff as a board.

108

Giru, what took you so long
to get us out of there?

109
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,041
Do you have
any idea what it's like

110
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,333
to be encased in
metal for that long,

111
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,541
and not be able to breathe or
move your arms and legs?

00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,791
[GIRU] Giru is metal. All metal!

because I'm gonna
tear you apart!

Ahh, excellent work! Top notch!

Don't move!

The life of your Saiyan
friend here is in my hand,

121
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,416
so stay back!

[DR. MYUU]
If this tablet is broken,

123
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,250
you can expect your friend to
never regain his original form.

124
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,041
Guard, contact General Rilldo

125
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,666

this location at once!

Yes, sir.

Nope.

but you more than anybody
should know how busy I was.

159
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, did you know the whole time?

160
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,500
I was hoping that we'd have a
much better chance at succeeding

161
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,291
if you two were in the
dark about the whole plan.

162
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,958
Well, I wasn't
really sure at first.

163
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,541
But then when you were turned
into metal by General Rilldo,

164
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,416
something just didn't ring true
about that. That's when I knew.

165
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,166
Ahh, very good.

166
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,041
[PAN]
Hey, wait just one minute.

167
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,583
What in the world
is going on here?

168
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,250
Why is it that I'm the only one

169
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,666
confused about
what just happened?

170
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,916
We're just saying that Giru is
one sneaky fellow, right buddy?

171
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,250
Giru?

172
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,125
[GIRU]
Giru sneaky.

173
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,583
Well, you see Pan, everything
that happened up to now

174
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,250
was planned by Giru and me.

175
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,750
Wha--?!

176
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:47,458
[GIRU] Metal Trunks a fake. Giru
made. Giru made. Giru, Giru.

177
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:52,375
[GIRU] Giru protect
Dragon Balls. Giru, Giru...

178
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,500
[GIRU] Giru sorry, Pan!
Giru sorry!

179
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,833
Oh Giru, I'm so glad you're with
us and not some rotten traitor!

180
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,750
Get them!

181
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
[GOKU]
Watch out!

182
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,791
I know you're hiding something
behind this door, Doc.

183
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,083
And seeing as
you're outnumbered,

184
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,625
why don't you just give up?

185
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:41,333
Goku! Pan! Giru! Why don't the
three of you come on up here?

186
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,583
I think our Dr. Myuu
has a little secret

187
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,500
he'd like to reveal to us!

188
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,708
A secret?

189
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,166
[DR. MYUU]
Ahhh! Stop!

190
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,583
[DR. MYUU]
Please don't open that!

191
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,083
[NARRATOR] Giru has
proven his true loyalties

192
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,750
by helping his friends foil
Dr. Myuu's evil scheme.

193
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,791
But there is
little time to celebrate

194
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,333
as the mad doctor's most
sinister secret of all

195
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,166
is about to be revealed!

196
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,750
What could this secret be?

197
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,666
And how can it be so important

198
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,708
that even Trunks would be forced
to trick his own friends

199
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,958
just to seek it out?

200
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:51,708
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball GT!
