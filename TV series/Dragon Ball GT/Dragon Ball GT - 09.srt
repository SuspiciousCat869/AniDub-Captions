00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR]
Last time on GT,

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,333
Doma was poised to cut Zoonama's
quake producing whiskers!

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,375
Never again will
you steal our peace!

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,375
[ZOONAMA] But before he
could finish the job,

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,333
Zoonama awoke and attempted
to conjure a quake!

6
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,791
However, this time his
true abilities were revealed.

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,875
[chanting]

8
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,333
[NARRATOR] The mighty Zoonama
wasn't so mighty after all!

9
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:46,666
He had the ability to predict
quakes, but not to cause them!

10
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,083
Trunks called his bluff

11
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,916
and now it was time to worry
about the real threat:

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,041
A temperamental volcano
that was ready to blow!

13
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,291
I don't want to die! Help me!

14
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,666
[NARRATOR] Never one to
back down from a challenge,

15
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,125
Goku decided to meet
the inferno, head on!

16
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,375
Ha!

17
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,666
[NARRATOR] Having quelled
both the forces of nature,

18
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
and the threat of Zoonama,

19
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,708
harmony was restored at last,

20
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,791
and payment in kind was
given for a job well done.

21
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,875
Thank you, Laine!

22
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
Thanks, Doma!

23
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,166
[NARRATOR] But before
the Six Star Ball was warm in

24
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,625
Pan's hand, an alien
presence made itself known,

25
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,541
and shocked the crowd!

26
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Give that back! It's ours!

27
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,375
[BON PARA] Thanks for
the Dragon Ball, suckers!

28
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:07,708
[NARRATOR] The chase is on,
today on Dragon Ball GT.

29
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,375
Come on! Hurry!

30
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,833
I hope this crate has
got some speed, Trunks!

31
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,833
Don't worry about that!

32
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,583
[TRUNKS] And she's no crate!
I'll prove it to you!

33
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,750
[GIRU] Dragon Ball dead ahead!
Giru! Giru!

34
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,583
Dragon Ball dead ahead!
Giru! Giru! Giru! Giru!

35
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,458
[PAN] There he is! Good job,
Trunks. Stay with him.

36
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,833
[GOKU] Our ship must
be faster than theirs.

37
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,333
[TRUNKS] I doubt he's played all
of his cards this quickly.

38
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,375
He's probably just testing us.

39
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,041
That is one weird looking ship.

40
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,125
Trunks! Can our ship
match that kind of speed?

41
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,583
[TRUNKS]
It has to!

42
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,750
[BON PARA] You should have seen
the look on their faces!

43
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,958
What a bunch of dopes!

44
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,875
[SON PARA]
Here! Let me see it!

45
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,375
Are you sure that
it's a Dragon Ball?

46
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,708
[BON PARA]
Yes, Son Para.

47
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,083
Well, it doesn't look
that special to me.

48
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,583
[DON PARA]
How could it, Son Para?

49
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,375
You're too skeptical, brother.

50
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,500
You don't know how to recognize
the finer things in life.

51
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,833
Don Para is right. You have
to have trust little brother.

52
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,208
Didn't Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy
assure us of their potency?

53
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,750
[beeping]

54
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,250
What is it?

55
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[CONFIRMED]
A shadow has been confirmed

56
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,166
at five kilometers, sir.

57
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,208
[BON PARA]
On screen.

58
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,500
It's them! Maybe they're
not as dumb as we thought!

59
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
Maximum speed.

60
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,875
[COMPUTER]
Warp drives engaged, sir.

61
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,916
[PAN] They're getting away!
Do something!

62
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,166
We're not getting any closer!
What's wrong with this ship now?

63
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,750
Nothing. She's doing just
what she was designed to do.

64
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,625
They're simply faster than us.

65
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,916
And they're basically
reaching speeds

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,750
that my engineers
said couldn't be reached.

67
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,000
[PAN] How much are you paying
those guys, Trunks?

68
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,375
My engineers?

69
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,166
They're all making about
eight figures plus benefits.

70
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,750
That's a lot of money.

71
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,958
Well I'd cut their pay in
half with no benefits,

72
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,666
until they do better
than second best!

73
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,083
Man, I'm glad
you're not my boss.

Hello! Yes, I am.

00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,958

78
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,958
Wow. That was some pretty
fancy flying. Good job.

79
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,916
Yeah, I thought we 
were gonners, for sure.

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,458
They might be faster than us,

81
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,791
but no one can outrun me
when I'm behind the wheel.

82
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:57,958
[screams]

83
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,625
Nice Trunks!
If you're such a great pilot,

84
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,833
why don't you try
outrunning a few asteroids?

[BON PARA]
Persistent, aren't they?

86
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,125
What a nuisance!

87
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,250
Can't a person do a little
stealing without being hassled?

88
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,541
Maybe we underestimated them.

89
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,916
What are we going to do?

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,375
Computer! Any recommendations
on how to lose our shadow?

91
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,750
[COMPUTER] Yes, Bon Para!
I suggest an ambush!

92
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,458
Lead your pursuers to Beehey!

93
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,500
Therein dwell creatures
known as Moumas!

94
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,333
The Mouma are giant,
bloodthirsty worms

95
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,291
that can swallow a ship
in a single bite!

96
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,125
Mouma will destroy
your shadow for you, sir!

97
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,666
You will not even have
to lift a finger!

98
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,625
Computer!
I like your style! To Beehey!

99
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,416
They're jumping to light speed!
Don't let them get away!

100
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,708
[COMPUTER]
Approaching Beehey.

101
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,250
[BON PARA] Excellent!
I hope the Mouma are hungry!

102
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,208
[evil chuckling]

103
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,875
I guess we'll follow 
them in. Here goes.

104
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,000
[PAN] How can you see
where you're going?

105
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,416
[TRUNKS]
I'm using my instruments.

106
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,750
Just a sec. I'll switch
on the spotlights.

107
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,250
[GOKU] Do you really think they
live in a place like this?

108
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:44,291
I doubt it. But they may
have a secret base here.

109
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,083
[BON PARA] Computer.
What are their chances?

110
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,666
[COMPUTER]
The cave system is a maze.

111
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,125
They have a fifty
percent chance

112
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,375
of successfully
navigating the corridors.

113
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,041
However, these calculations
were made before considering

114
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,833
the threat of the Mouma.

115
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,125
[BON PARA] What if you threw
them into the equation?

116
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,916
[COMPUTER] Their
chance of survival will then

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,416
decrease dramatically, sir. I
calculate less than one percent.

118
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,125
Less than one percent. Now those
are odds that I can live with!

119
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,916
How about you, brothers?

120
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,125
For sure! It works for me!

Good! Computer set
a course for Luud!

No, Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy.
I searched far and wide,

but the galaxy is so vast,

But in death, this journeyman

because his vital energy

When I say beg, I mean now!

158
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,416
[BELIEVERS]
Enyaka, Yakayaka!

159
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,208
Luud! Sama!

160
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,666
Dama Lama!

161
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,166
Dama Sama Lama!

162
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,708
Enyaka, Yakayaka!

163
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,541
Luud Dama Lama Sama!

164
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,916
Enyaka, Yakayaka!

165
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,208
Luud Dama...

166
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,458
[DON PARA] Paras!
Let's get out of here!

167
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,958
Brothers!

168
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,875
The one he dealt with harshly
failed where we succeeded!

169
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,666
We have a Dragon Ball!

170
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,375
Oh. Yeah, right.

171
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,291
That's the ticket! Be bold!

172
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,583
We're the ones in
the driver's seat!

173
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,583
That's what I'm saying!

174
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,833
[MUTCHY MUTCHY]
Next! Approach the altar.

175
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
Yes. O-Of course.

176
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,250
[MUTCHY MUTCHY] Did you bring
an offering for Lord Luud?

177
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,791
Yes, Cardinal.

178
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,791
My brothers and I have brought
a Dragon Ball as requested.

179
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,916
[MUTCHY MUTCHY]
Oh! Well then, let's see!

180
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,291
Yes. Well,
it's authentic all right!

181
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,625
Para brothers!

182
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,958
You have accomplished what
many others could not!

183
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,875
You are the first
ones to succeed!

184
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,958
See! There's nothing
to fear here, brothers!

185
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,500
He's rolling out
the red carpet for us!

186
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,916
I wonder what kind of
reward we're gonna get!

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,083
[MUTCHY MUTCHY] I wish I could
give the three of you a reward,

188
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,166
but sadly I can't.

189
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm afraid you've
committed a terrible blunder.

190
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,541
According to a divine
message from Lord Luud,

191
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,000
you Para Para brothers

192
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,416
have let a Dragon Ball slip
through your fingers!

193
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
A grave offense indeed!

194
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
But we've got it!

195
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,875
[MUTCHY MUTCHY] The cretins that
you took this Dragon Ball from

196
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
had another one on their ship!

197
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,375
And you let it get away!

198
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,208
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

199
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,541
Give us another chance
Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy!

200
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,875
I beg you!

201
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,875
[MUTCHY MUTCHY]
I have interceded for you Paras!

202
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,500
You have one more chance!

203
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,708
Thank you, Cardinal! Thank you!

204
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,416
[MUTCHY MUTCHY]
Don't fail me!

205
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,791
Yes, Cardinal!

206
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,541
[BON PARA] Computer!
Set a course for Planet Beehey!

207
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,708
That ship we ditched
has a Dragon Ball on it,

208
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,125
and we Paras will be living in
a shoe box if we don't get it!

209
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,250
[COMPUTER]
Yes, sir! Destination, Beehey!

210
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,833
But! What if it's too late?

211
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,458
What if Mouma have
already eaten them?

212
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,625
I don't want to be a doll!

213
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,958
Computer! Maximum speed!

214
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,500
It's a maze!

215
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,166
We could search through
this rock for a whole year

216
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,166
and never find them.

217
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,875
I have an idea! Giru, locate
the Dragon Ball they stole.

218
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,083
[GIRU] Giru! Giru! Dragon Ball
gone! Dragon Ball missing!

219
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
What do you mean missing?
You're a walking Dragon Radar!

220
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,583
The Dragon Ball's signal has
got to be on there somewhere!

221
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:30,458
Unless you're
defective, that is!

222
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,875
Nothing.

223
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,833
None of the Balls are showing
up. Maybe he has to eat.

224
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,458
I think it's because
we're under solid rock.

225
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,250
Let's get out of here then!

226
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,208
For once, I think we're
in agreement on something.

227
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,041
[GIRU]
Monster! Monster!

228
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,083
Those things are disgusting!

229
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Yeah, and dangerous!
Why can't I sense its energy?

230
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,291
[GIRU]
Monster approaching!

231
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,916
That is one big worm!

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,875
Trunks! Look out above!

233
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,708
[SON PARA] Wait! We're not going
further in there, are we?

234
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,333
[BON PARA] We don't
have a choice, brother!

235
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,000
[SON PARA] But what if a Mouma
gets a hold of us?

236
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,583
[BON PARA]
We'll have to take that risk!

237
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,625
[SON PARA] B-But our chances
of survival in there

238
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,416
are less than one percent!

239
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,541
Yes! But we're the
Para Brothers! Are we not?

240
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,916
[SON PARA] It's them.
They're alive.

241
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,416
[DON PARA]
Thank goodness!

242

00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,625
[GIRU]
Giru to the rescue!

Giru! Giru!

[DON PARA]
Look at 'em!

252
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,625
They're standing up to Mouma!
Are they crazy?

253
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,708
[SON PARA] They're going
to die, brothers! It's suicide!

254
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,333
How perfect!

255
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,583
[BON PARA] While those idiots
are being brave

256
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,291
and getting themselves killed,

257
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,500
we'll sneak onto their ship
and take their Dragon Ball!

258
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,708
Ingenious!

259
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,416
It runs in the blood!

260
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,125
[battle crys]

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,541
How strong is he?

263
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,708
[TRUNKS] More company,
you guys! Look out!

264
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,458
What amazingly strong creatures!
All alone out here in space!

265
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,333
Who would have ever thought?

266
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,083
Let's hope we live
to tell about it!

267

[NARRATOR]
As Goku, Pan, and Trunks

268
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,791
stare into the jaws of death,

269
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:22,875
the Para Brothers take advantage
of an opportune moment!

270
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,416
Who is this
mysterious Lord Luud

271
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,958
and his bewitching
Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy,

272
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,458
who has the power to
turn people into dolls?

273
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,541
Ensnared in a deadly trap,

274
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,083
the voyagers from
Earth are in danger

275
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,583
of losing their Dragon Balls
and their lives

276
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:46,416
at the hands of a cult that
they don't even know exists!

277
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:53,166
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next Dragon Ball GT.
