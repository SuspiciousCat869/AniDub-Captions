00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,875
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball GT,

2
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,750
Giru's quick thinking saved
Goku from a gruesome fate!

3
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,000
How dare you betray me when
it is I who gave you life,

4
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,833
you insubordinate bot?!

5
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:32,000
[GIRU] Betray? Giru never betray
his friends. Giru, Giru.

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,708
What?

7
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,375
[TRUNKS] I'm all right!
I'm up here! See?!

8
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,583
Everything that
happened was thanks to

9
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,791
the careful planning
of Giru and myself.

10
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,833
I bet you didn't
see that coming.

11
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
[NARRATOR] As everyone
celebrated the victory,

12
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,708
Dr. Myuu made a break

13
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,166
to try and stop his most valued
secret from being exposed.

14
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,583
But Trunks was one step ahead.

15
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,833
S-Stop! Don't open that!

16
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,625
[NARRATOR] Behind this door
lies a mystery so dark,

17
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,208
that even Trunks had to
deceive his closest friends

18
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,958
for it to be discovered.

19
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:23,958
Find out what terror awaits them
right now on Dragon Ball GT!

20
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,708
[DR. MYUU] Stop it!
Don't get any closer!

21
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:12,208
My Baby, my baby. I'm sorry.

22
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,250
Please forgive me for
allowing them to see you.

23
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,250
[machine pulsating]

24
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,750
[machine pulsating]

25
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,875
I didn't want to expose you

26
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
to the eyes of such
filthy creatures

27
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,750
before you attained
your complete form.

28
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,500
[machine pulsating]

29
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
[DR. MYUU]
I'm sorry, baby.

30
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,875
I know how long
you've been waiting,

31
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,958
how frightened you
must be in there.

32
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,416
Uh, what's that
thing in the water?

33
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,541
It looks
like a robot baby.

34
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,625
You're close, Pan.
It's called Baby,

35
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,458
an infant machine that
was created by Dr. Myuu,

36
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,416
only he applied a
restructuring method

37
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,250
not used on any other
robot on this planet.

38
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,541
[TRUNKS]
When that thing is full grown

39
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,000
its power could surpass us all.

40
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,208
Maybe even before then,
if he develops a workable body.

41
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,416
There's still a lot of questions
we don't have answers for.

42
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,708
You've got to be kidding?
Can he really get that powerful?

43
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,291
How did a bunch of
rotten Saiyans like them

44
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,750
learn the secret of my baby?

45
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:47,333
Even among robots, rumors can
spread like fire. Right, Giru?

46
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,583
[GIRU]
Giru heard story.

47
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,708
Dr. Myuu build greater
machine mutant.

48
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:56,208
When new Baby is born, all other
robots to be dismantled! Giru...

49
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,750
[DR. MYUU]
What?

50
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,416
[TRUNKS] When Giru told
me this, I had him show me

51
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
where the main computer
was and I shut it off.

52
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,208
It's over.

53
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,125
[DR. MYUU] But--
How could he do this?!

54
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:21,166
Oh, Baby! My beautiful baby!

55
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,083
Please wake up!
Please, don't die! My baby!!

56
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,083
What did you do
to my baby? You animal!

57
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,625
Simple. I re-routed
his life support

58
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,291
into the unit's
plumbing system.

59
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,083
[TRUNKS] Your baby will stop
functioning soon.

60
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,166
And then we'll be safe.

61
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:31,875
No! You can't!
You can't die on me! Baby!

62
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,083
[pained groaning]

63
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,208
If I can find the
internal power switch,

64
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,041
I can still redirect the
power in time to save him!

65
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,958
Just like Rilldo said,
Dr. Myuu's sole aim

66
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,583
is to control
the entire galaxy.

67
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,333
If he wants the whole galaxy,

68
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,875
then he had those beady little
eyes set on the earth, too.

69
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,625
[TRUNKS]
Of course he did.

70
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,000
[PAN] Who does
this guy think he is?

71
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,916
[GOKU] He's just like every
other villain out there, Pan.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
[TRUNKS] Right.
He's greedy.

73
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,500
That's why, while he continued
with the research on Baby,

74
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,291
he began mobilizing the older
models of robots on this planet

75
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,291
using a military
style of control.

76
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,958
It's all practice for the day he
finally takes over the galaxy.

77
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,250
[GIRU] Giru and robots forced
to do bad things. Bad things.

78
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,250
Yeah, but if it 
wasn't for you, Giru,

79
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,000
Dr. Myuu might have
taken over the galaxy.

80
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,833
I think that shows a
pretty healthy good side.

81
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,666
[GIRU]
Is that true?

82
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,458
You're my hero.

83
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,250
[GIRU] Giru have much concern
over homeland and Dr. Myuu,

84
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,000
concern over bad stories.

85
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,500
Know he must change!
Then met new friends.

86
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,000
When we found Giru
in the desert,

87
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,375
an abnormality in his
data was activated,

88
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,416
probably due to
the shock of his journey.

89
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,208
He experienced what we would
refer to as a loss of memory

90
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,375
or amnesia.

91
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,833
So he really is
a defective little robot.

92
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,791
[GIRU]
What?!

93
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,541
I'm just kidding, Giru.

94
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,416
And when we drifted
close to his planet,

95
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,208
the abnormality
repaired itself,

96
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,250
and his memory started
working again.

97
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,250
[GIRU]
Giru told Trunks everything.

98
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,583
And Trunks help Giru. Giru...

99
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,666
[ANGRY BOT] Doesn't
look so tough to Bot K58.

100
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,583
[ANGRY BOT]
Ah, whatever.

101
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,041
--Trunks! Trunks!
--Giru, you did a nice job.

102
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,916
Now where's that baby?

103
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,833
[GIRU]
Giru could not find.

104
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,625
But Giru did locate Dr. Myuu's
hidden laboratory. Giru.

105
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,875
Even better! That way we can
stop this problem at the source.

106
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,166
How do we get there?

107
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,958
Hey! What a
handsome young devil.

108
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,625
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru.

109
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:54,125
[both laughing]

110
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,416
[TRUNKS] It's good we found this
before he was finished with it.

111
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,666
I wouldn't have wanted
to stare that thing down.

112
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,708
How could anybody even think to
create such a horrifing thing?

113
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,833
[TRUNKS] But you have to
recognize the genius it takes...

114
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,458
--You Fools! What have you done?
--...an idea so radical.

115
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,083
No! You can't die on me!!

116
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:54,708
My life's work, blown away,
disintegrated in an instant.

117
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,250
You cannot die, baby.

118
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,958
Remember all that
we're trying to achieve!

119
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,708
[DR. MYUU] Think about yourself,
your life, what you will be

120
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,166
when you finally ascend
to your true form.

121
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,750
Remember, the power given to you
through the sacrifice of Luud.

122
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,583
Remember, you are
made of the galaxy!

123
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,750
Energies from all across it
pulse through your body,

124
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,750
giving you life!

125
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:25,000
This power is greater than
any the galaxy has ever known!

126
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,458
Do you understand?

127
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,041
That means the galaxy is
yours for the taking!

128
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:34,916
Live, Baby! Please!
You're my only baby. My only...

129
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,875
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

130
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,458
[PAN] I'm, uh, I'm kind of
feeling sorry for him.

131
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,916
It's too bad. I really wish I
could have fought him just once.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,333
Goku!

133
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,791
Do me a favor and
please try to stay focused.

134
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,375
But I am focused!

135
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,625
I guess you're right.

136
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,416
What do you think?

137
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,791
Has that little guy
stopped functioning yet?

138
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,041
[GOKU] Wow!
Look at that! Impressive!

139
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,041
You can't turn his power back
on for just a little bit?

140
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,541
Oh, Grandpa.

141
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
Goku, please!

142
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,375
You!

143
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,625
Don't you dare put your
hands on baby's capsule!

144
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,208
[DR. MYUU]
You disgusting, vile Saiyan!

145
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,916
Ah! My baby!

146
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,916
What happened?

147
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,500
[GIRU] Danger, danger! Run!
Get away! Get away!

148
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,625
[DR. MYUU]
Live my baby!

149
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,541
Baby! My darling baby!

150
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,583
[PAN]
Look!

151
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,250
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru, Giru...

152
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,791
That's impossible!

153
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,083
Trunks, how is
this all happening?

154
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,250
So the little guy
didn't die after all?

155
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:51,000
I, I don't get it. His breathing
apparatus and computer

156
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,250
should be off-line by now.

157
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,375
[DR. MYUU]
Oh Baby, I'm so happy!

158
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,958
I knew you couldn't die
that easily my baby!

159
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,833
Your power is too deep
in your circuits!

160
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:09,208
And now you can show everyone
what you're truly capable of!

161
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,916
I can't... I mean it's... Whoa.

162
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,333
His power keeps growing.
Stay sharp.

163
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,666
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

164
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,625
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru...

165
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,666
That thing is
giving me the creeps.

166
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,875
Well, I'm ready 
for whatever it's got!

167
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,750
[GIRU] All will die!
All will die!! Run! Run!

168
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,041
[PAN]
Giru, don't start panicking!

169
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,500
[maiacal laugh]

170
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,625
Ah!

171
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,833
Ugh!

172
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,041
Ow!

173
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:31,000
[clacking]

174
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,916
Pan! Trunks! Giru! Watch out!

175
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,791
[screams]

176
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,833
Incredible!

177
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,166
And he's not even
fully developed yet!

178
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,541
[screams]

179
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,583
[DR. MYUU]
That's right.

180
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,958
You must become strong, my baby!

181
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,458
You must rise up and destroy
those who have disturbed you!

182
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:29,708
Kill the Saiyans! Make them
pay for dishonoring you!

183
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,500
[screams]

184
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,666
Kill... Sai... yan.

185
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:56,041
[DR. MYUU] That's right Baby.
The Saiyans! Kill the Saiyans!

186
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,708
Sai...yan.

187
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,083
Sai... yan.

188
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,916
Kill.

189
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,791
Pan!

190
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,375
Trunks! Now!

191
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,583
[screaming]

192
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,958
[Baby screaming in pain]

193
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,500
No! Baby!

194
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,250
So did we get him?

195
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,291
[GIRU]
Danger has passed.

196
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,708
[DR. MYUU] Now I understand
the true nature of a Saiyan.

197
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,583
[single beep]

198
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,500
[PAN] That's a spaceship!
He's going to try

199
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,416
and fly out of here!

200
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,708
He can't--

201
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,708
Farewell.

202
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,458
Hey! You can't leave now!

203
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,083
I haven't even started
warming up yet!

204
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,291
I am so sick of
cowards running away!

205
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,916
[GOKU]
Pan, calm down!

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,958
[PAN]
Let go of me, Grandpa!

207
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,625
The next time I get my hands
on him, I'm gonna rip him ap--

208
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,583
[TRUNKS] Pan, we can't worry
about Dr. Myuu any longer.

209
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,000
But, he got away.

210
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,666
Right, but Baby is dead.

211
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,291
And without him,
Dr. Myuu doesn't have

212
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,375
any hope of taking
over the galaxy.

213
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,708
So, the best thing for us to do

214
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,500
is get back to finding
the Dragon Balls.

215
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,750
You're right. But,
what about our ship?

216
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,791
How are we gonna fix it?

217
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,041
That's no problem.

218
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,125
[GIRU] Giru fix ship well,
back to normal.

219
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,875
How convenient!
You're quite the handyman!

220
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,041
[DR. MYUU] Saiyans!
Disgusting Saiyans!

221
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:21,083
They're mucking up my entire
operation to conquer the galaxy.

222
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,000
Though, I'm not the type
to give up that easily

223
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,750
because of a setback.

224
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,833
If I can learn
from these mistakes,

225
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,333
I'll be ready for
the resurrection

226
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:33,916
in a few short months and
then my baby will be reborn!

227
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:43,458
"My baby." Every time I hear
that it makes my insides boil,

228
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,416
so much I want to explode!

229
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,541
[BABY]
You fool.

230
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,000
You have no idea who
the boss is do you?

231
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,500
You are nothing but 
a simple machine mutant.

232
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
For it was I who
programmed you to gather

233
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,333
the energy needed
for my resurrection.

234
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,041
And it was I who gave you
the plans for creating Luud

235
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,791
and the other machine mutants!

236
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,250
Yet, you had no idea,
you feeble shell of a machine.

237
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,750
Your time on
this planet is over.

238
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,750
But my time is just beginning.

239
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,708
I will be the one to bring
Planet M2 to completion.

240
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:32,666
[evil chuckling]

241
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,791
[NARRATOR] After having
Dr. Myuu construct him,

242
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,750
Baby used and destroyed the
doctor to make a quick escape!

243
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,416
Will he be as merciless
when it comes to

244
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,708
the Saiyans who disturbed him?

245
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,541
I know three disgusting
creatures who have to die today.

246
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,375
And I know they
won't be expecting me.
