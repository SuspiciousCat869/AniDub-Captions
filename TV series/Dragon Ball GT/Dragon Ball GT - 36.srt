You have to wake up.

159
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,166
I think for our safety
as well as theirs,

160
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,125
maybe they should
stay like this.

161
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,583
At least for a little while,

162
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,625
until Goku knocks
off that gorilla.

163
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,541
[SS4 GOKU] You're playing
a dirty game here, Baby.

164
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,625
[BABY] No one ever presented
me with a rulebook

165
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,250
on taking over the galaxy.

166
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,458
But I'd say I'm doing quite well
considering that I'm winning.

167
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,208
[BABY]
Super Gallic Gun!

168
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:57,708
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

169
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,875
Not the Earth!

170
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,291
[SS4 GOKU]
Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

171
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,833
Ha!

172
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,666
No, it won't
make it in time!

173
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,375
[KRILLIN]
Please tell me this is the last

174
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,916
of what you need to buy today.

175
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,208
We need supplies. When they
call us to the Tuffle planet,

176
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,708
we want to be ready,
don't we, Dad?

177
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:10,000
[PEOPLE screaming]

178
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,958
[MARRON]
Dad, what is it?

179
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,791
I... I don't know.

180
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,333
[SS4 GOKU] Just what do
you think you're doing?

181
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,666
[BABY GORILLA cackling]

182
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,166
[BABY]
What am I doing?

183
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
Anything I can to
see that horrified,

184
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,000
confused look on your face.

185
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,666
It's not about me, it's
about the people of Earth.

186
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,083
They may be your followers,

187
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,166
but it's my job to save
them from their leader.

188
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,500
Now, laugh at this!

189
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:06,750
[SS4 GOKU]
Ka...Me...Ha...Me...

190
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,625
Ha!

191
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:17,333
[BABY GORILLA groaning]

192
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,083
[BABY BULMA gasping]

193
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,833
[BOTH gasping]

194
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,458
[SS4 GOKU]
I'm sorry, Vegeta.

195
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,375
I had to sacrifice your body,

196
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,333
but it was for the survival
of the Earth and its people.

197
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,250
[SS4 GOKU] Please, I hope
you can forgive me.

198
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,166
I did my best, old friend.

199
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,125
[BABY GORILLA cackling]

200
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,375
[GORILLA GOKU]
It can't be!

201
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,708
[BABY GORILLA cackling]

202
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,041
[BABY] Well, your best just
wasn't good enough, old friend!

203
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,916
Impossible! How could
he withstand that?

204
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,916
[OLD KAI]
Oh, this isn't very good.

205
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,333
[KIBITP] But Ancestor, what
about Goku's Kamehameha Wave?

206
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,416
Shouldn't that have put
Baby down permanently?

207
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,541
No, something's different here.
Look at his eyes, would you?

208
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,125
There's a strange energy there.

209
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,208
[SUGORO] He just looks like
a big, crazy monkey to me.

210
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,375
I've got it. He went through
such an unnatural way of

211
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,750
achieving his gorilla form

212
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,416
that it may be causing
some adverse effects.

213
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,666
[BABY]
Now, it's my turn.

214
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,125
You can get out of the way
of this blast if you want to,

215
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,500
but first take a look at
what's right behind you.

216
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:49,000
From what I can tell, only one
more hit at full strength

217
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,666
and that precious planet of
yours will be blown to bits!

218
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,416
[BABY cackling]

219
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,625
And you're willing to
sink that low, Baby?

220
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,458
[BABY]
Super Gallic Gun!

221
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,041
[SS4 GOKU] If I get out of
the way, the Earth is doomed!

222
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,291
Baby! You have not
seen the last of me!

223
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,541
[BABY] Oh-ho! That's going
to leave a bruise!

224
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,250
[BABY GORILLA cackling]

225
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,833
[BABY BULMA]
Lord Baby!

226
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,250
He's lost all control. If he
makes an attack like that again,

227
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,666
the force of the Earth's
explosion will send debris and

228
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,958
shockwaves smashing
into the Tuffle planet,

229
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,458
destroying it too.

230
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,000
But then if he does,
he'll kill himself.

231
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,791
Hasn't he thought about that?

232
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,333
[SUGORO] Well it doesn't
seem like there's

233
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,250
much thinking going on at all.

234
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,125
He's out of his gourd
like the old man said.

235
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,375
[NARRATOR] With Baby's mind
poisoned even further

236
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,583
by the his gorilla
transformation,

237
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,333
he has come to act
on only one emotion.

238
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,791
The desire to kill Goku.

239
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,291
But if Baby's rage carries with
it the destruction of the Earth,

240
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,625
then the Tuffle planet falls
with it, and everyone will die.

241
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,250
The Earth, now more
than ever, needs a hero.

242
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,375
Find out the
destiny of humankind

243
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:52,583
on the next episode
of Dragon Ball GT!
