[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball GT,

2
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,541
Goku battled Baby, who had
taken over Vegeta's body.

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,125
Even Goku's own sons
were against him.

4
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:24,041
They, too, were being controlled
by the deranged parasite.

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,458
But just as it looked
like help had arrived,

6
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,458
Goku found out
that even Trunks

7
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,166
was fully ensnared by
Baby's web of control.

8
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,083
Trunks!

9
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,750
Come on! 
You've been friends forever!

10
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,916
Seeking to destroy Goku,

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,125
Baby called forth
all of the hatred

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,958
that his people had
for the Saiyans,

13
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,958
who had destroyed
their race long ago!

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,291
Let it go! Find a way
to rebuild peacefully!

Battered and unable to move,

17
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,666
Goku could only watch as the
dark energy descended upon him!

18
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,458
Then, poof! 
Buu can't feel Goku anymore!

19
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,500
Goku!

20

I don't believe it!

right now on GT.

by sipping from
this cup of power.

him with my own eyes!

your word! If I lose, I die!

I go free and clear!

[SUGORO] Now then,
the rules are simple.

You role the dice, you get to
advance that number of spaces.

Whoever reaches the end
first wins, but no cheating!

Oh, yeah! I think
I forgot to mention!

Some spaces have directions!

forward or backward,

who are you talking about?

I meant Goku!

Baby was attacking him
with a powerful, dark energy!

153

I snatched him up just
in the nick of time!

But the repercussions
of that blast

155
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,875
were far more severe
than I realized!

156

Just as I was making my
inter-dimensional shift,

157
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,166
I was caught in the shockwave!

158
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,541
Goku fell into a different
dimension, into Sugoroku Space!

159
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,291
I lost him.

160
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,916
Oh, dear! Not only that,
you lost him in Sugoroku Space,

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,083
the one place we can't help him!

162
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,416
My powers don't work there!
They're useless in that realm!

163
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,583
He's going to have to find
a way out on his own somehow!

164
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,750
Do you know what
the odds of that are?

165
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,208
This must be the biggest
bungle a Kai has made

166
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,500
since I let myself get
trapped in the Z Sword!

167
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,625
[GOKU] Three, four,
five, and stop!

168
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,958
Now what's up?

169
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,666
And the answer is: You!

170
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,125
Answer a riddle
correctly to proceed!

171
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,541
Hey! What's going on? Stop
this crazy thing! Let me down!

172
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,083
You lucky dog!
This is my favorite part!

173
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,541
The riddle will be easy
since you're a child!

174
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm not a child!
I told you that already!

175
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,250
And the first question is...

176
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,666
Hey! Wait! This isn't fair!
I'm no good at riddles!

177
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,916
Listen up!
What can run, but not walk?

178
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,416
What? What do you mean!
Me? Is the answer "Me"?

179
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:18,666
U-Uh! Sorry! Wrong! The
correct answer is: Water.

180
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,958
Water can run but not walk.

181
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,500
I get it.
They're like trick questions.

182
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,916
Answer wrong and
the hole gets bigger!

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,166
Careful, Goku! If it gets
too big, you'll fall in!

184
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,208
Trust me! That's not good!

185
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,500
What's down there?

186
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:41,125
[SUGORO] That's it! Take a look!
Deep, deep, down!

187
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,833
Question two!

188
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,958
No! I'm not good at this!

189
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,541
[BABY] This is it!

190
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,500
Capsule Corporation's
Doom's Day Transport!

191
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:30,416
Yes! Rise, my masterpiece!

192
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,250
A fitting gift for the Tuffles!

193
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,833
The Transport is
clear for take-off!

194
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,166
Baby! I'm at
your service, Master!

195
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,041
Well done!

196
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,958
Excellent! It's perfectly
suited for our needs!

197
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:02,833
Trunks! What--

198
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,500
Let him go, Pan. Please.

199
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,458
He's my best friend, Gramps!

200
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,291
I know, honey. I know.

201
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,875
What has a bottom at it's top?

202
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
Aaah! Krillin!

203
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,458
No! The correct
answer is: A leg!

204
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,416
A leg has a bottom at its top!

205
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:36,500
[GOKU sputtering]

206
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,666
All right, then!
Question Number Three!

207
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,000
Who always rides in a taxi,
but never pays?

208
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,916
Oh! Vegeta!

209
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,416
Nope! Wrong again!
The answer is: the taxi driver!

210
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,958
[GOKU yells]

211
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,000
[GOKU]
Why can't I fly?

212
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,083
Oh, dear. Flying's
against the rules.

213
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,750
I really should have told him.

214
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,625
He didn't last long at all.
How disappointing.

215
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,958
I should have known better
than to play with a child.

216
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,875
It's just not fun!

217
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,375
[GOKU]
I'm not a child!

218

[SUGORO gasps]

219
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,208
How is this possible?
This has never happened before!

220
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you sure you're alive?

221
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,458
Oh, yeah, I'm sure! Still here!

222
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,833
Then it's my turn!

223
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,083
C'mon, six!

224
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,625
I said six!

225
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,916
Whoo-hoo! Another six!
Your turn, Goku!

226
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,958
Hmm?

227
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,333
Super Challenge!
Player must not cry!

228
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,875
Now what? What's that
supposed to mean?

229
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,375
Why can't I land
on a normal spot?

230
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,875
Oh, boy! Super Challenge!
Goku, if you cry, you die!

231
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:02,083
If you pass the challenge by
not crying you get to play on!

232
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:06,125
Great! No more riddles!
What a relief! I like this one!

233
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
You do?

234
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,708
Yeah, it's simple!
I never cry! Ever!

235
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,416
Then you should do very well!

236
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Show 'em what you're
made of, Goku!

Woo-hoo!

What are these?
Onions? Eww, Yuk!

239

Uhhh!

240

You stinky onions!
You can't make me cry!

I won't let you! I won't!

242

How can you resist?
This is overwhelming!

243
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,958
Yowza! Now for the second
part of the Super Challenge!

Do you hear me? Sick!

I've had it! 
You're always gone!

249
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,791
You never earn a Zeni,
and all you do is train!

Chi Chi! What are
you doing with that?

251
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,291
You know how I hate shots!

252
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,250
Now hold still!

253
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,750
Are those tears I see?

Hmm!

You're not doing
so bad yourself I see!

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,375
Go back five spaces!

What?

263
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,500
Advance four spaces!

Go back three!

265

Move ahead two!

266

Go back one space!

This is crazy! No matter what
I do I end up on the same spot!

[SUGORO] What? Don't tell me
you're still down on Lava Lane!

happening to me, and not to you?

no shame? Cheating a child!

run out sometime, Sugoro!

at last! We are whole again!
