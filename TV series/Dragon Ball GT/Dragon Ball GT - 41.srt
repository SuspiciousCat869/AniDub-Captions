[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

3
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,375
Earth was a mere two
weeks away from exploding.

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,875
In a last ditch effort,

5
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,833
Goku and his friends used
every ounce of their powers

6
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,416
to move all the people of
Earth to the Tuffle planet.

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,833
[PICCOLO]
It's okay, Gohan.

8
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,000
I know now that it was
meant to be this way.

9
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:42,250
Sometimes we have to look beyond
what we want and do what's best.

10
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,000

[NARRATOR]
With the noble death of Piccolo,

17
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,958
the Black Star Dragon Balls
became nothing more

18
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,666
than ordinary rocks.

19
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,375
And the Earth was returned
to its previous glory

20
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,291
by a wish on the
Namekian Dragon Balls.

It is a time of
new opportunities,

Of all the weird

here competing as a kid again.

[CHARLIE screaming]

Goku! Goku! Goku! Goku!

43
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,416
That's kind of strange.
I didn't even touch him.

00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,375
[GOKU] Yeah, now that's
what I call a fight!

45

Hey! So you guys made it.

46
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,833
[KRILLIN] Yeah, but we already
missed your first fight.

47
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,375
Why didn't you tell us you were

48
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,708
competing in the
junior division, Goku?

49
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,250
I didn't know.

[HERCULE depressed]
Oh...

00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,166
[HERCULE]
Now that Buu's gone,

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,708
there's no real competition
out there anymore.

Man, am I depressed.

54
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,041
Maybe it's time
to call it quits

55
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,416
on this whole
World Champion thing.

56
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,875
[GOKU]
Hey, there, Mr. Satan.

57
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,583
I think something is
wrong with your contest.

58
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,666
[HERCULE]
What do you mean by that, Goku?

59
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,333
Well, I mean Pan is
fighting the adults

60
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,791
and I'm fighting the children.

61
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,333
But I'm not a kid,
and she's not an adult.

62
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,208
Oh, that's right.

63
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,041
Well Goku, the
divisions are determined

64
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,166
by the height of the fighters.

65
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,166
If you were a
centimeter taller,

66
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,875
you'd only barely make
the adult division.

67
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,208
And Pan is just a
little bigger than you.

68
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,041
Yeah, I guess you have a point.

69
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,125
There are height limits,

70
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,083
so I figure I'll just have
to fight at half strength.

71
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,250
Should be fun.

72
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,333
[KRILLIN laughing]

73
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,000
Wow, he really duped you.

74
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,125
Those aren't the rules.
Mr. Satan made them up.

75
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,250
Come on!

76
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,625
He'd much rather see
his granddaughter

77
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,791
win this competition
than you, Goku.

78
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,333
So, if Dad were to
enter as an adult,

79
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,791
Pan would have less of a
chance to emerge the victor.

80
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,083
Of course, that's just like
my father to fix a fight.

81
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,666
[GOKU] It's not that, Videl.
He just wants the best for Pan.

00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,208
Ah, Mr. Satan, we have
the lineup for the semi-finals.

163
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,625
[HERCULE]
Ah, let's see here.

164
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:35,916
We got Papaya Man, Madd Chili,
Super-One, Matt Cat...

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,791
Hey! What about Pan?
Huh? Where's her name?

166
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,208
[MONK]
I'm sorry, sir.

167
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,583
But your granddaughter forfeited
her place in the draw.

168
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,666
She said she had a tummy ache.

169
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,166
That really hurts, sir.

170
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,416
Forfeit?

171
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Sorry.

172
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
[VEGETA]
No one in this competition

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,166
deserves to take
Satan's place.

174
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,916
They better allow late
entries into this contest

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,458
or they'll have big
problems on their hands.

176
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,458
So, what was it that made
you forfeit the match?

177
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,916
You knew you were
going to win, didn't you?

178
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,666
Yeah. But this young lady
has bigger plans for her life

179
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,583
than being a multi-millionaire
fighting champion.

180
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,791
Look at Goku,
fighting like a champ

181
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,583
even though there's no
prize at the end of the road.

182
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,000
That's so him.

183
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:11,000
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the junior division, final bout!

184
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,666
Now welcome, Goku!

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,416
And in this corner, Mugley!

186
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,833
[MUGLEY whimpering]

187
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,791
[MUGLEY shrieking]

188
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,375
[ANNOUNCER] Now, boys, let's
get this match underway!

189
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,791
[MONK B] But the deadline to
enter the fight has passed!

190
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,291
[MONK C] If he gets to enter
the fight, then so do I!

191
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,250
[MONK B]
Don't you start with me!

192
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,666
[MONK C]
Get out of my way!

193
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:53,333
[MONKS groaning]

194
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,083
Oh, hi Vegeta!

195
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,333
Why don't you fight
a worthy opponent?

196
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,166
It's not my job to
pick the opponents,

197
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,000
so I gotta fight him first.

198
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,291
[MUGLEY whimpering]

199
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:22,125
A crying... boy?
How did he make it this far?

200
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,083
This is the kid's division.

201
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,958
[MUGLEY whimpering]

202
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,916
[MUGLEY shrieking]

203
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,250
[MUGLEY yells]

204
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,791
He's out! Mugley wins!

205
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,416
[GOKU]
Not yet!

206
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,375
Would you give me a
second to hop back up there?

207
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:59,125
[MUGLEY gruting]

208
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:06,333
[GOKU laughing, grunting]

209
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,125
[GOKU laughing]

210
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,291
Now that one was out
of the ring for sure!

211
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mugley wins!

212
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,125
[CROWD chanting]
Mugley! Mugley! Mugley!

213
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,041
Yea! Uh-huh!
Oh yeah! That's right!

214
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,583
He won!

215
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,166
I guess I had to lose sometime.

216
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,833
I can't believe it.
This is simply embarrassing.

217
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,166
We will begin the semi-finals
in the adult division very soon.

218
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,083
Until then, don't forget to
visit our concession stands

219
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,375
to stock up on lollipops,
foot long dogs, and sodas,

220
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,625
all at reasonable prices.

221
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,333
Looks like I made it
just in the nick of time.

222
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,291
[thumping]

223
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,916
Wonder what that is.

224
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,250
[VEGETA]
You're all mine! You hear me?

225
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm going to win this fight!

226
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,791
See ya, Dad. This looks like
one of those private moments.

227
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,208
[VEGETA] No one can stand
against a warrior this focused!

228
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,500
[ANNOUNCER] Your first
competitor in the semi-finals

229
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,500
is the masterful Madd Chili!

230

[CROWD cheering]

231
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,875
Competitor two is the quick
and colorful Papaya Man!

232
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:30,166
[CROWD cheering]

233
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,416
Oh, hey! Hey, Trunks! Over here!

234
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,625
[TRUNKS]
This is the finals, right?

235
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,791
I don't see Goku or Pan
down there, anywhere.

236
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,166
[PAN]
Surprise!

237
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Care for a lollipop?

238
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,375
What are you doing here?

239
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,875
[TRUNKS] So, who is this
Papaya Man character

240
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
I've been hearing about
since I got here?

241
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,375
[KRILLIN]
He's looking good.

242
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,791
Up to now, he's won most of his
fights with a single punch.

243
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
[TRUNKS] Sounds like he
would have given Pan

244
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,583
a run for her money.

245
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,875
Let the first round begin!

246
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,250
[MADD CHILI grunting]

[MADD CHILI groaning]

248
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,750
[MADD CHILI]
That was fast.

00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,791
[CROWD cheering]

250
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:22,083
[ANNOUNCER] You saw it folks!
Papaya Man is your champion!

251
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,083
[PAN] He's tough, but he
couldn't beat my other grandpa.

252
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,916
What are you talking about,
Pan? He's stronger than that.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,666
He's only using one-billionth
his actual strength.

254
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,208
And I suppose that you
know who he really is.

255
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,083
[GOKU] Hey, Majuub! Cut the
act! Take off your mask!

256
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,125
[ALL]
What a sec. That's Majuub!

257
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,708
[HERCULE]
Papaya Man is the champion?!

258
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,250
Did you see what he was wearing?

259
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,833
A kid with taste like that

260
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,041
can't make this
outfit look good.

261
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,791
And now, the round you've
all been waiting for.

262
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,916
It's time for your World
Martial Arts Champion, Majuub,

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,708
to take the stage one last time.

it is both my duty
and my sheer pleasure

266
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,791
to introduce you to
the one, the only,

267
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,333
Mr. Satan!

268
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,791
[HERCULE]
Mr. Satan is on the scene

269
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,416
and he's ready to rock! Yes!

270
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,333
Where's Papaya Man?

271
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,916
[ANNOUNCER] Majuub is Papaya
Man. He was wearing a mask.

272
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,625
Uh okay.

00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,333
Majuub, I wish you a good fight.

Thanks, sir. You, too.

[MAJUUB] I've finally done it.
I am going to fight Mr. Satan.

I hope you're
watching this, Mom.

[ANNOUNCER]
The fight is now underway!

278
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,125
[MAJUUB] I'll give him a
fight he'll never forget!

279
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,916
You're starting
kinda fast there--

Majuub's pretty intense!

283
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,791
I guess he's really
taking this fight seriously.

284
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
Why isn't Mr. Satan moving?

285
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,958
[MAJUUB]
Now to finish him off!

[HERCULE screaming]

287
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,541
You no beat Mr. Satan.

[BUU]
You are fighting Earth's hero.

289
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,291
How would all the people
feel if he lost this fight?

290
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,291
What? What's he--

291
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,208
[HERCULE]
Are you makin' fun of me?

292
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,958
I'll show you!

[ANNOUNCER] Majuub is out
of the ring! Mr. Satan wins!

Coming as no surprise to
any tournament fan here,

297
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,958
Mr. Satan is still
your champion!

298
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,125
I actually won against Majuub.

299
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,333
I didn't know I
still had it in me.

I'm the champion of the world!

I can truly retire.

[GOKU]
Why so glum?

305
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,791
You should be proud of

306
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,666
the way you handled
that match, Majuub.

307
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,583
Thanks for letting
my gramps win.

308
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,500
I know it means
the world to him.

309
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,000
It wasn't like that.

310
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,500
Buu came to me and explained
why I should let him win.

311
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,125
It's no use being
modest, Majuub.

312

We can all see
right through you.

There will be many happy
returns to the ring for me!

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,458
I'm glad I could help you out,
Mr. World Champion.

319
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,083
[GOKU] I gotta say, it was
a pretty good tournament.

320
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,000
But most of the guys out there
would be ten times as strong

321
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
if they just trained some more.

322
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,500
Then, I guess I should
train twice as hard now.

323
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,958
I don't want any
of them beating me.

324
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,875
[KRILLIN] You really think
one of those puny guys

325
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,625
are a threat to you?

326
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,208
[VEGETA] Especially when
there's a real threat

327
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,875
standing right here.

328
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,666
I'd say playtime is over.

329
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,708
Okay, it's been a
while since we did this.

330
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,125
[BOTH grunting]

331
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,000
[PAN] We're on a
bridge, Grandpa!

332
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,625
[TRUNKS] Yeah,
Father cut it out!

333
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,000
[growling]

334
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,083
Sorry, but do you mind
if we continue this

335
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,333
after I get something to eat?

336
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:32,291
[ALL groaning]

337
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,708
[VEGETA laughing]

338
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,583
[NARRATOR] Goku proves once
again that of all his powers,

339
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,583
none can hold a candle to
the power of his stomach.

340
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,375
But these good times
can't last forever.

341
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:54,083
Somewhere in the universe,
an evil force is looming.
