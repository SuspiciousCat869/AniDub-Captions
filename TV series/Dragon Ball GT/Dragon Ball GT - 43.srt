[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,125
the people of Earth
were shocked when a

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,666
giant black hole
split open the sky,

4
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,625
and a flood of death
and destruction

5
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,916
poured through at
the hands of Android 17!

It seems the first move in
your strategy is a success.

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,333
The powers resonating in the
identical Android 17's have

10
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,208
perfectly fused these
two worlds together.

11
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,208
Then, we should have a toast.

13

if he wants to keep this evil

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,208
from destroying
his precious Earth,

15
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,458
then he'll come to Hell
alone to finish this!

00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,708
[NARRATOR] Goku accepted Android
17's challenge and ventured

00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,750
through the portal into Hell.

20
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,250
Little did he know,

21
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,916

set by Doctors Myuu and Gero!

22

That hole better not close.

there permanently.

to conquer the planet Earth.

In the meantime,

31
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,208
Goku will have his hands
full as he prepares for an

164
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,166
[CELL] I've done it! I've
trapped him inside me,

165
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,625
and there's nothing he can do.

166
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,666
The strength I've
absorbed from Goku

167
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,625
is almost overwhelming.

168
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,708
I could accomplish
anything with this power!

That was a close one.

You got lucky!

[GOKU] Luck has nothing
to do with it, Cell.

I simply had a better

Don't let your confidence

blind your ability to see.

180
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,708
Because here in the dapths of
Hell, nothing is what it seems.

00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,791
That includes techniques you
