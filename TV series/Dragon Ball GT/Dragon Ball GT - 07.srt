[NARRATOR]
On the last GT,

2
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,500
Goku, Pan, and Trunks
set down in a land of giants

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,625
where bugs were
the size of humans.

4
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,333
It was the trio's first time
to get such an up close view

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,500
of the Insect Kingdom.

6
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,333
But would it also be their last?

No!

This isn't what you think!
I'm not a bug! I'm a girl!

10
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,541
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the Four Star Ball had become

11
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,708
wedged in an apple, and
before it could be retrieved,

12
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,458
a Giant had it for lunch.

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,166
Did he just...

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,208
I'm afraid so! This is bad!

15
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,916
[NARRATOR] Suddenly, the gentle
Giant was gripped with agony.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,458
The Dragon Ball had become
lodged in his tooth.

17
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,708
I hate to do this!

18
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:10,875
Ka... Me... Ha... Me... Ha!

19
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,333
[NARRATOR] Thanks to some
quick dental work by Goku,

20
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,208
the prize was finally won.

21
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,250
Well, guys! First one! Not bad!

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
Tah-dah!

23
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,375
Yes! At this rate a

the rest out right now

00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,041
or you're gonna get it!

27
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,916
That's the last straw, Giru!

28

You had your chance
and you blew it!

[GIRU] No! Let go!
Not fair! Giru! Giru!

[PAN] Well, I could dump
you out the airlock.

00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,083
Would that be fair?

37
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,416
Eating a control panel
is practically mutiny!

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
This will teach you to have
a little self-control! Hmm!

39

[GIRU] Aah! Trunks! Help!
Please! Giru! Giru! Giru!

40
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,125
Pan, maybe we should think
of a different punishment.

[GOKU] Let's just feed
him until he's full!

I mean, that always worked
for me when I'm hungry.

But Grandpa! I'm trying to
discipline him! Do you mind?!

00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,208
And besides, what do you
intend to feed him?

45
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,375
Navigation Equipment?
Landing gear?

46
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,458
Why not our Life

[GIRU] Sorry, Pan. It was
too delicious to resist.

Try that again and you're
headed for the scrap pile!

51
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,625
One thing's certain. We need to
buy an energy supply for Giru.

If we want any peace of
mind around here, that is.

There's no doubt about it.

Yeah. There's not a soul around.

can save the lives of
millions of our people.

We have tried to appease him

by offering him our most
valuable treasures:

Our finest corn,
the best of our grapes,

our freshest nuts,

309
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,750
[ZOONAMA] Where are you
my beautiful, little bride?

310
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,291
Here comes Zoonama!

311
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,166
[MAN]
Zoonama!

312
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,541
[WOMAN]
Somebody help us!

313
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,541
Dah, daht, dah, dah!
Dah, daht, dah, dah!

314
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:14,625
Dah, daht, dah, dah, daht,
dah, dah, daht, dah, dah!

315
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,291
All right! Come out my sweet!

316
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,583
Trunks! That's your cue!

317
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,625
[crash]

318
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,541
Ugh!

319
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,125
Laine, Dear! It's Zoonama!

320
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,125
Where are you?

321
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,416
Get out here! Or I'll level
this whole village with a quake

322
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,333
and melt the remains 
with lava! Do you hear me?

323
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,083
[TRUNKS]
I'm up here, Zoonama!

324
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,333
You big, ugly tub of lard!

325
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,958
[ZOONAMA] Did I hear
you whispering, Laine?

326
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,250
Keeping secrets from
the groom, huh?

327
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,458
No! I would never dream
of hiding anything from you!

328
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,166
Hmm. I can't put
my finger on it,

329
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,458
but there's something
different about you today.

330
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,291
I think it's your voice.

331
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,916
[PAN] Trunks!
Your acting stinks!

332
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,583
You have to be more demure!

333
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,625
[ZOONAMA]
Is something wrong?

334
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,541
Oh, no! I caught a bit of
a cold last night, that's all.

335
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,541
Oh, what a relief! I wouldn't
want my bride to change a bit!

336
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,541
Now come close to me, Laine,

337
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,916
and let's have a look
at your beautiful face!

338
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:32,875
Wedding veils are nice! But let
me sneak a little peek at you!

339
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,000
[TRUNKS] If he lifts this veil,
it's all over!

340
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,375
[NARRATOR] One of the Earth's
most eligible bachelors

341
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,875
puts it all on the line
to save two planets!

342
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,916
Can Trunks pass the test, or is
the operation to disarm Zoonama

343
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,375
about to come
to a screeching halt?

344
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:54,208
Stay tuned for scenes
from the next Dragon Ball GT!
