00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,791
[NARRATR]
On the last Dragon Ball GT,

2
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,166
a routine space flight

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,125
turned into a harrowing
quest for survival.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,416
The loss of a small
part during take-off

5
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,250
led to a much bigger problem.

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,625
[BULMA]
A perfect match! Finally!

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,041
And the mystery part is...

8
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,416
[screams]

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,000
No! Of all the parts,
why that one?!

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,708
[NARRATOR] Without the use of
the missing stabilizer jet,

11
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,666
the ship was doomed to
break apart during flight.

12
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,583
Attempting to crash-land
was the only option.

13
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,083
[TRUNKS] We'll make
an emergency landing.

14
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,833
[NARRATOR]
Disaster was averted,

15
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,125
but being visitors on Imecka
posed its own problems.

16
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,916
The money-hungry merchants
were determined

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,583
to take the Earthlings
for everything they had.

18
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,708
I'll just charge it
to your account.

19
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,541
[NARRATOR] Victimized by
a greedy ruler,

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,083
the locals can't even afford
to keep a roof over their heads.

21
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,916
But Pan, Trunks, and Goku
had their own worries.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,583
[GIRU] Giru! Giru!
Giru! Giru!

23
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,041
[NARRATOR] And when they came
across a hungry little robot,

24
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,041
they had even more.

25
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,875
Without that radar our
whole mission is history!

26
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,000
There goes our ship.

27
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
[NARRATOR] Avoiding the locals'
problems was the plan,

28
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,458
but by a twist of fate,

29
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,458
Goku, Pan, and Trunks
were being drawn

30
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,125
--into the heart of Imecka! 
--Hey! Come back here with that!

31
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,166
[TRUNKS]
Well, there she goes.

32
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,583
[GIRU]
Giru.

33
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,583
Man, what else could go wrong?

34
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,291
We can't just stand
here, that's our ship.

35
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,291
If we don't get it back
we'll be stranded.

36
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,125
Yeah. Right.

37
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,416
No sweat.
I'll get us there in a flash.

38
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,125
Huh?

39
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,958
Oh, I get it.
Instant Transmission! Right?

40
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,041
[PAN] And just where
do you think you're going?

41
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,416
Not so fast there!

42
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,125
Until we figure out how
to extract our radar,

43
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,583
you're part of the family!

44
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,375
So get used to
hanging out, buddy-boy!

45
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,000
[PAN] This is just a precaution.
A little insurance policy.

46
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,041
[GIRU]
Stop. Tickles.

47
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,083
There! That ought to keep
you from running off again,

48
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,916
you little sneak!

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
[GIRU]
Giru!

50
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,333
Entering maximum security.
Here! You hold him, Trunks!

51
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,541
Gee, Pan... thanks a lot.

52
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,000
That dumb robot has wasted
enough of our time.

53
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,541
Let's go get our ship!

54
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,500
Whatd'ya say, Grandpa?

55
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,000
All right. Just grab on
when you're ready, guys!

56
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,875
Here goes!

57
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,708
Ooh!

58
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,708
[screaming]

59
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,416
Are we there yet?

60
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,125
Wait a second! I recognize
that rock formation!

61
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,750
We're in the same spot as
before, you knuckle head!

62
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,958
Yeah, I thought it looked
familiar. How strange!

63
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,708
I've never had any
problems in the past.

64
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,958
Huh. Weird. What now?

65
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,833
Well, I'd like to
give it one more shot!

66
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,625
[GOKU] All right!
Here goes!

67
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,958
Hold on!

68
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,208
[whimpers]

69
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,833
We went a little further.

70
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,666
[PAN] Grandpa, if I live, please
remind me to kill you!

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,666
[screaming]

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,500
[painful bounce]

73
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,250
[painful bounce]

74
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:27,791
[painful bounce]

[thud]

76
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,291
I don't understand. I'm doing
it the same as I always have.

77
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,666
Yes, that may be so. But your
body's different! Remember?

78
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,500
You've never done Instant
Transmission as a child before!

79
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,958
It might not work!

80
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,875
Well, whatever it is, you're not
using me as a guinea pig again!

81
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,458
So let's go get our ship...
the old fashioned way!

82
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,208
[ATTENDANT]
Your mid-day meal, my Lord!

83
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,333
If it pleases you, Sire!

84
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,500
Yes, it's fine.
My compliments to the chef.

85
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,125
[LEZICK]
Your scouts have returned.

86
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,791
[DON KEE] Yes.
What is it, Gale?

87
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,375
[GAIL]
Aye, Lord!

88
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,666
That spaceship that was found
in the desert-- we've got it!

89
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,500
It's all yours now!
Finders keepers!

90
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,583
[DON KEE]
Show me.

91
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,666
[DON KEE] Sheila,
what's your evaluation?

92
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,083
[SHEILA] Lord, whoever designed
it had function in mind,

93
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,583
but not fashion!

94
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,875
It may work well, but as you
can see, it's an eyesore!

95
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,500
It's not going to
fetch anywhere near

96
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,333
what the sleeker models are
getting in the marketplace.

97
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,833
In a word, it's ugly.

98
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,041
Well, then what good is it?

99
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,208
There's no rare treasure inside,
no crew members for slaves!

100
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,791
So, why have you brought
me this ridiculous ship?!

101
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,208
Sire, you're the one with the
good taste; I'm just a grunt.

102
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,166
Only a refined person like you

103
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,166
can truly know if a thing
has any value or not.

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,833
You're not as stupid
as you look, Gale!

105
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
Now tear that ship apart
and sell it as scrap!

106
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,875
[DON KEE] That's my word!
Make it happen!

107
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,000
[PAN] Are you crazy?
We aren't sightseeing!

108
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,750
We're supposed to
be avoiding the lights!

109
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,666
[GOKU] I was
trying to see the ship!

110
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,375
This is the Royal Palace.

111
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,041
I thought the guys that
stole our spaceship

112
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,208
were like poachers
or merchants.

113
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,000
Maybe it's not really here.
Maybe there's been some mistake.

114
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,416
[TRUNKS]
No, the tracks don't lie.

115
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,958
They led us right to the gate.

116
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,958
Then our ship
must be down there.

117
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,833
[PAN] Well, the evidence
definitely points to it,

118
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,375
but what would a wealthy
king want with our ship?

119
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,708
He might want to sell it.
It's a pretty nice ship.

120
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,958
I mean it was designed
by Capsule Corp.

121
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,291
I'm sure it would go
for a good price.

122
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,500
We're talking about a
man who has everything.

123
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,083
Why would someone with all that
money care about our ship?

124
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm a CEO back home, Pan.

125
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,625
I've seen two millionaires fight
over one Zeni on the floor.

126
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,875
Well, if it's here,

127
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,208
it's gonna be hard to
find without being seen.

128
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,625
I've already found
the ship, silly.

129
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,791
Grandpa, please!

130
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,625
Wait! What?!

131
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,291
Yeah, it's right there.

132
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,791
Hmm?!

133
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,000
[TRUNKS] I'll be darned.
There it is.

134
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,250
You weren't kidding, Goku.

135
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,500
It was right under our
noses the whole time!

136
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,750
Thanks a lot, Grandpa! You
could have told us, you know!

137
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,583
What a jerk!

138
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
But I tried.
You weren't listening.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,958
Whatever. Next time the joke's
on you. Now, let's go get it.

140
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,000
[GUARD] Did you see that
outfit Sheila had on?

141
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,250
[GUARD WITH DRINK] Yeah! But I
wouldn't say that too loud.

142
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,708
Gale might hear you.
He gets jealous.

143
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,541
Huh?

144
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,958
[TRUNKS]
There she is!

145
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,541
And I bet we're not gonna get
her back without a fight.

146
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,791
Um... So, should
we go in head on?

147
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,875
Huh? This is a stealth
operation, you numb skull!

148
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,375
There are thousands of
armed guards in this palace!

149
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,833
We don't want them all swarming
around us like bees, do we?

150
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,375
No, I guess not.

151
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,333
If we have to blow our cover
to get out then we'll do it!

152
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:09,833
But only as a last resort!
Okay? Now, let's go!

153
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,833
[groans]

154
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,083
Sshhh!

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,041
Yeah! I forgot!

156
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,208
[GUARD] Yeah, so I got extended
leave comin' up in a few days.

we were trying to avoid

It's too late!
That was then and this is now!

I say we get out of here.

If we beat up
a bunch of police,

then we'll really
look like criminals.

Once again, we're out

Everything happens

Would you rather
go back to the ship?

307

Then we'd just have to walk

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,041
all the way back here
again to get the parts.
