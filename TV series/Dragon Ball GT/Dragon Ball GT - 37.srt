Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,500
[SS4 GOKU]
Now, laugh at this!

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,583
Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

4
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,333
Ha!

5
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,500
[NARRATOR] Goku, using all
the energy he could muster,

6
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,500
unleashed an Ultimate
Kamehameha Wave on Baby,

7
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,875
his fiercest attack yet!

8
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,375
[SS4 GOKU] Your overconfidence
will be your undoing.

[BABY GORILLA cackling]

10
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,875
[NARRATOR] Having withstood
Goku's attack with ease,

11
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,791
Baby armed himself with
the Super Gallic Gun

12
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,125
to wreak havoc on
the now winded Saiyan!

13
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,708
[SS4 GOKU] Are you willing
to sink that low, Baby?

14
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,958
[BABY]
Super Gallic Gun!

15
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,583
Baby! You haven't
seen the last of me!

16

[BABY GORILLA cackling]

17
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
[BABY] Oh-ho! That's
going to leave a bruise!

18
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,541
He's lost all control. If he
makes an attack like that again,

19
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,708
the force of the earth's
explosion will send debris

20
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,916
and shockwaves smashing
into the Tuffle planet,

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,083
destroying it, too.

22
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,458
But then he'd kill himself!

23
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,625
[NARRATOR] With every
passing minute, the fate

24
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,333
of the Tuffle planet and all
it's Earth-born inhabitants

25
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,083
grows more and more bleak,

26
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,416
as it hangs in the balance
of Baby's own sanity!

27
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,833
Is this the final day
of the human race,

28
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,541
or will Goku be
able to stop it?

What's he waiting for?

31
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,250
Oh, this is not
looking good.

32
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,958
[BABY]
If that's all he's got,

33

Come on already.

00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,541

[BABY]
Your time has come, Saiyan!

42
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,041

you'd like to share?

[CROWD screaming]

46
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,708
[BABY] Who in the world
could have attacked me?

47
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,541
It couldn't have
been the Saiyan.

48
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,750
He was lying face down in
the dirt the whole time.

49
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,708
Unless... Of course!

50
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,625
Now. Laugh at this!

Ha!

53
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,583
[BABY] It figures he
has a delayed attack.

54
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,166
I guess he needs
his dirty tricks

55
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,375
to have any chance against me.

56
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,291
[SS4 GOKU] Looks like you
weren't expecting that one,

57
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,625
were you, Baby?

58
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,250
You should try to
be more perceptive.

59
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
[BABY] The only thing I'm
going to do is kill you

60
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,750
as quickly and
painfully as possible.

61
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,083
So let's cut to the chase and
do what we came here to do!

62
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,125
You know, I've heard enough.

63
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,416
You're having trouble
standing on your own feet,

64
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,583
much less fighting me.

65
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,625
[BABY]
You're hallucinating then.

66
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,000
There's enough
fight in this body

67
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,333
to last me for weeks on end!

68
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,333
Think so? Try me.

I can't believe

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,416
they knocked each
other out, Ancestor.

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,625
I mean, what an
amazing fight so far!

75
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,125
Okay! Now's our chance!

[ALL gasp]

77
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,458
What exactly do
you have in mind?

78
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,458
Listen up. It's very important
that you focus right now.

79
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,166
Yes, because focusing
is the key to

80
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,208
channeling enough energy
to revive Goku's power.

81
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,583
[OLD KAI]
No, dummy.

82
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,541
You don't have nearly
enough power to revive Goku

83
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,166
since he's a Super Saiyan Four.

84
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,750
You would need to match his
power to even attempt it!

85
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,666
But--

86
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,166
[OLD KAI] Why don't you start by
reviving Trunks or Gohan first?

87
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,833
What in the world are
you talking about?

88
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,166
Don't you know? Trunks has
been taken over by Baby,

89
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,625
so reviving him would
only be helping the enemy.

90
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,125
It doesn't make sense.

91
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,166
That's why you'll need
the Sacred Water.

92
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,333
Sacred Wa--
That's right!

93
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,875
The Sacred water
at the Lookout!

94
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,916
Why didn't I think
of that earlier?

95
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,208
Well, if it's a secret,
how do you know about it?

96
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,916
No, not 'Secret Water,'
Sacred Water!

97
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,625
[KIBITO] Sacred Water is
a legendary liquid

98
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,541
with enormous healing powers.

99
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,958
When splashed on a person,

100
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,083
it purifies and removes
all toxins from the body.

101
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:06,083
Oh... Then I won't tell anyone.

102
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,708
That's great! And I vow to do

103
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,000
whatever it takes to
obtain the sacred water,

104
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,875
and begin soaking every infected
being with it's cleansing power.

105
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,000
Then why don't you fetch
some, Mr. Know-It-All!

106
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,541
Yes. Yes, of course. I'll be
back right away. Wish me luck.

107
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,416
[OLD KAI] It's about time
he got going, eh?

108
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,666
He can be such a
burden at times.

109
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,166
That was quick.

110
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
Sorry about this but,

111
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,625
where do I go to find
the Sacred Water again?

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,791
Kibito, where has your mind
been for all these years?

113
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,708
Do you really not know?!

114
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,416
I'm sorry, Ancestor.

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,916
It's by the throne in the
temple at Kami's Lookout!

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,583
Now get moving!

117
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,791
Right away, sir!

Whoa, that was a close call.

It looks like Popo and Dende
are still under Baby's control.

122
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,375
I need to be
extremely careful!

[KIBITO gasps]

124
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,416
Look at me. Even though
I may be a Kai Spirit,

125
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,083
I'm sneaking around like
a petty cat burglar!

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,291
[KIBITO] There's the throne that
Old Kai was talking about!

127
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,250
And there's the Sacred Water!

128
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,458
There's not as much as
I thought there would be!

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,583
Looks like I hit the jackpot!

130
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,833
There's plenty here
to cure everyone!

131
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,875
Tastes normal!

132
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,833
There's so many
of these barrels.

133
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,458
How does Old Kai expect
me to carry them away?

134
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,916
And how can I be
sure that all of this

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,375
is even the right stuff?

136
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
[BABY DENDE]
Why are you running around here

137
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,291
like some kind of
cat burglar, Kibito?

138
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,500
Surely you're not thinking
of using this Sacred Water

139
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,041
against the wishes of Baby,

140
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,958
because those who try
such a foolish things

141
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,750
meet with a grim fate.

142

[BABY DENDE]
Even though you're a Kai,

we cannot allow this
to go any further.

What's happening
to you, Popo! Popo!

What happened?

Hey, you're back to normal!

170
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,875
Kibito, why are you here?

171
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay, I found the Sacred Water.
Now I need to find Trunks.

172
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,625
Make sure it's on tight.

173
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,333
Now, Trunks.

174
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,541
There he is!
Gotta go guys. See ya later!

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,541
Are you as lost as I am?

176
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,750
Yeah.

177
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:04,000
Listen up, Trunks. You've got
to drink this! Come on! Wake up!

178
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,958
Drink! You only
need a little bit.

179

[TRUNKS groaning]

Is that you Kibito Kai?

181
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,166
Don't you worry, Trunks.
You're back to your old self.

182
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,875
Yeah, but where am I?

183
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,000
[TRUNKS] Okay, you want me to go
down there and take out Baby,

184
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,708
or at least keep him
busy for awhile.

185
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,375
How much time do you need?

186
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,541
Well, as much as you can.
And while you're doing that,

187
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,583
I'll start using this
water on everyone else,

188
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,291
starting with Gohan.

189
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,000
Great! Sounds like a plan.

190
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,250
[KIBITO]
I have faith in you Trunks.

191
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625

Lord Baby!

195
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,375
What's happend here?

196
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,791
The only way to revive him is
with the Blutz Wave Amplifier!

197
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:43,375
I just hope it works as well
as last time. It has too!

198
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,541
The antennae are in place.

199
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,625
We're ready to go.

200
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,041
Now is your chance.
Baby, you must stand up!

201
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,333
This may be the last time
I get the amplifier running!

How can this be?

00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,625
I'm filling up with
power, growing stronger.

213
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,583
You've really outdone
yourself, Bulma!

214
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,583
Lord Baby! These are
pure Blutz Waves.

You will receive
all of the energy

Where... Where did
that come from?

00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,333
[KIBITO]
What is that?

227
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,500
I hope it's not too late.

[BABY GORILLA cackling]

229
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,208
[SS4 GOKU] I see you're
feeling better now, Baby.

230
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,750
It's funny. Did you know
that when you're sleeping,

231
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,666
like just now. You snore
like a little baby?

232
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,000
[BABY] So, you still have enough
strength to actually speak,

233
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,375
do you?

234
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,500
[SS4 GOKU] Well, while you
were laid out unconscious

235
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,625
on the ground, I decided to take
a little nap until you woke up.

236
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,291
And may I say
that this has been

237
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,166
one of my most
rewarding battles ever.

238
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,166
Which makes my achieving Super
Saiyan 4 all the more worth it.

239
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,375
[BABY] Oh, is that so? This must
be your inner peace taking over

240
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,000
to make the transition into
death that much easier!

241
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,125
I will enjoy this!

242
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,958
[SUGORO] Wow! Goku is the most
amazing guy I've ever seen!

243
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,958
He looks like he'll be able
to hold off Baby forever now!

244
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,333
Don't you think so, Old Kai?
Don't you? Hm?

245
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:04,583
Unfortunately, Goku
is only playing a bluff.

246
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

247
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,791
Goku is bluffing?

248
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,083
Yes, he's probably

249
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,583
completely drained of
his power at this point.

250
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,541
He may be able to get off
one Kamehameha wave,

251
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,041
but only at normal power.

252
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,166
Uh oh, that's not good.

253
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,250
[BABY GORILLA roaring]

254
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,875
[BABY] I had more than enough
chances to kill you earlier,

255
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,375
but each time
I underestimated you.

256
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,458
Now I'm running
on hatred alone,

257
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,666
and nothing will stop me from
dropping you at death's door!

258
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,666
Baby, there's no need for you
to blame me for your mistakes.

259
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,333
[SS4 GOKU]
Okay, enough bluffing Goku.

260
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,041
I practically have
no power left

261
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,333
and my legs feel like
they're made of jelly.

262
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,500
If my body can't handle
what I need to do,

263
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,958
then I'll have to force him
to make his own mistakes.

264
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,416
That may be my only
option at this point.

265
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,125
[BABY]
Well?

266
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:28,833
Are you ready to finish this
battle once and for all, Saiyan?

267
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,416
[SS4 GOKU] Actually, I'm looking
forward to continuing this.

268
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,208
Allow me to
demonstrate some more

269
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,916
of my new Super Saiyan
powers for you!

270

[BABY GORILLA cackling]

273
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,958
[NARRATOR] Now that Baby
has recovered his energy

274
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:23,166
to full power, Goku is facing
his toughest predicament yet,

275
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,875
as his own powers have
drained almost completely.

276
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,916
But Old Kai and Kibito Kai
have set the wheels in motion

277
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,458
by beginning to take back
some of the key Saiyans

278
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,500
currently controlled by Baby!

279
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,333
Can Kibito Kai work fast enough

280
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,875
to organize the counter-attack
of newly revived Saiyans?

281
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,083
Although Goku's bluff
is working for now,

282
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,416
how long will he
be able to hold it?

283
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
And will that buy enough
time for Kibito Kai?

284
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,625
Don't miss the
exciting conclusion

285
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,000
on the next Dragon Ball GT!
