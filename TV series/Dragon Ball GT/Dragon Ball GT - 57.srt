Last time on Dragon Ball GT,

00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,083
Goku and the Four-Star Dragon
battled fiercely,

Shenron, the Three-Star Dragon,

I told you to kill him,
not melt him, you imbecile!

I'll take him
out in five seconds!

Using my granddaughter

is the most despicable thing
you could have done, Eis!

Coward! You just used me
as a shield, didn't you?

Yes, but the truth is you're
no longer useful in that regard.

Now, move so I can
get back to work!

If you're both so
annoyed with how I fight,

then show me a rulebook
for world domination,

and I might consider
changing my style.

It's supposed to be
an impenetrable beam!

You can't use the

You're lucky to have someone
so respectful stand up for you.

You should thank him, Eis.

done thanking him,

Dragons were born

164
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,125
because you misused
the Dragon Balls, remember?

165
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,291
It all started with you.

166
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,000
Your world is crumbling
because of your actions.

167
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,250
You were warned
about the overuse,

168
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,250
but you didn't listen.

169
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,708
This is all your fault!

170
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,500
Everything we ever wished for

171
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,875
was always for the
good of the planet.

172
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,875
Old Kai warned me,
and I felt bad for doing it.

173
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,916
But I never made a selfish wish.

174
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,708
Every wish made on the
Dragon Balls was important.

175
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,875
Do you hear me?

176
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,875
I did what was right
for the planet then,

177
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,791
and I'll do what is right
for the planet now,

178
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,041
even if I'm blind.

179
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,041
A noble monkey...

180
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,833
If you feel so
bad about it then

181
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,750
maybe death should
be your penance.

182
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,000
[GOKU yells]

183
00:16:54,041 --> 00:17:03,375
[SYN laughs maniacally]

184
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:13,041
[SYN] Oops!
Guess I used a bit too much.

185
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,750
But now you know
what I'm capable of!

186
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,458
Your power's amazing.

187
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,458
You destroyed the entire
city with one blast!

188
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,625
And now, your time has come.

189
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,125
Oof!

190
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,458
What do you think so far?

191
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,583
I'm not the easy catch
you thought, am I?

192
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:36,750
No Syn, I don't underestimate
my opponents, ever!

193
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,000
Well then,

194
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,625
I'm going to miss your good
sportsmanlike attitude.

195
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,833
Somehow, I don't think
he saw that one coming.

196
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,250
The Dragon Balls...

197
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:24,541
Grandpa, Grandpa what happened?

198
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,958
[GOKU]
Not yet.

199
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,583
Not yet.

200
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,541
One more second.

201
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,666
Now!

202
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,875
Ka... Me...

203
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,875
Ha... Me...

204
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:02,750
Ha!

205
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,458
I did it.

206
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, you certainly did it,
all right, Goku.

207
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,666
But none of it
seems to hurt me.

208
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,333
Something's wrong.

209
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,666
That blast should have at least
put some kind of dent in you.

210
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,750
Should have...

211
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,333
So what you're
learning right now,

212
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,750
is the fact that you are simply
not strong enough to beat me.

213
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,208
[PAN yelling]

214
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,250
[NARRATOR] With Goku
blinded and unconscious,

215
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,166
Pan is left helpless to face

216
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,916
the supremely powerful
One-Star Dragon.

217
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,416
Will help arrive in time,

218
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,125
or will the heroes be overcome
by Syn Shenron's might?

219
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,750
Help Papa... and Trunks!

220
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,375
Everyone!

221
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,583
We need your help.
Grandpa's in trouble!

222
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,875
Don't miss the next GT.
