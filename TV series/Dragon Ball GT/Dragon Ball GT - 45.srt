Last time on Dragon Ball GT...

Goku broke free of the ice trap

00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,625
set for him by Frieza and
Cell in the bowels of Hell.

But knowing that the
ice would only work

merged into one perfect being.

And the terror that this

Can you really get me
out of here, Piccolo?

I hope you have a plan,

I can hear you loud
and clear, Piccolo!

51
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,916
[PICCOLO] I will be sending
an energy beam from Hell.

52
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,875
Listen to me, Dende.

53
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,291
You'll have to send me
an equal amount of energy.

54
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,166
This is the only
way it'll work.

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,791
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?

56
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,375
It's easy! All we
have to do is send

57
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,916
a highly direct stream
of energy to each other.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,916
[PICCOLO] My understanding
of the situation

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,208
is that the two Android 17s

60
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,208
created that giant
hole in the sky,

61
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,041
when they converged their powers
together between the two worlds.

62
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,541
If we can emulate what they did,

63
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,625
we will open up a gate
between Hell and the Lookout,

64
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,208
allowing Goku enough time
to escape back to Earth.

65
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,375

then I'm all for it.

Alright Piccolo.
I'm ready when you are.

but are you guys planning
on doing some type of fusion?

71
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,375
Yes, but it's a fusion
of the minds, Goku.

Okay, Dende! Let's begin.
