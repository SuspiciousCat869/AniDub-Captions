00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,000
[NARRATOR]
Last time on GT...

2
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,291
Baby revealed himself to be one
of the last remaining Tuffles,

3
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:25,166
one of the first alien races
to be destroyed by the Saiyans.

4
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,000
After taking over the
bodies of Gohan and Goten,

5
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,750
Baby set his sights on Vegeta,
and defeated him with ease.

6
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,625
After that it was only
a matter of time

7
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,375
before the rest of planet Earth
fell under Baby's control.

8
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,916
With all seven Dragon Balls
recovered, Goku, Trunks, and Pan

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,750
are headed back home to Earth.

10
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,166
Little do they know that
everything they hold dear

11
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,250
is now infected by Baby!

12
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,375
Pan, come look!

13
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,291
[PAN]
What is it? Are we there yet?

14
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,750
It's Earth! I can't
wait to get home

15
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,875
and tell everyone
all about our trip!

16
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,000
It's unbelievable!

17
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,291
I recovered the Dragon Ball
that Rilldo stole,

18
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,166
and of course I rescued Trunks

19
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,333
after Dr. Myuu had
turned him into metal!

20
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah... That is unbelievable.
Considering it didn't happen.

21
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,041
[GIRU]
Ouch!

22
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,375
You almost got us killed Giru.

23
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,958
Oh right...

24
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,541
And I'll be sure not to say
anything about all your crying.

25
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,500
Hey Trunks, let's stop by

26
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,416
Kami's Lookout
before we go home.

27
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,625
Great! Sounds good.

28
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,541
Hey, Dende! Popo!
How are you doing?

29
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,708
Hey, Goku.

30
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,708
It's been forever
since we've seen you.

31
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,208
How have you been lately?

32
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,208
[PAN]
Move it! Get out of my way!

33
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,208
Earth is safe.

34
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,666
With the help of my
wonderful assistants here,

35
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,500
I was able to retrieve all
seven of the Dragon Balls

36
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,416
with my bare hands!

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,958
Which is quite an amazing feat
for a little girl like me.

38
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,666
Pretty cool, huh?

39
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,208
Uh... You did all
the work, right Goku?

40
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,083
[GOKU laughing]

41
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,416
Hey you! Down here! I'm the
one you should talk to!

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,750
I did more than him!

43
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,750
Oh, of course. I forgot you--

44
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,500
How dare you forget me!

45
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,666
Please forgive my rudeness, Pan.

46
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,041
Uh... Goku.

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,666
Let's put the Dragon Balls
in a safe place

48
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,958
so we can keep them
out of harm's way.

49
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,750
[GOKU] Sounds good to me.
The safer the better.

50
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,458
Hey wait a second!
If you do that, Grandpa,

51
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,333
then you won't be able to get
back to your original size!

52
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,666
It was the Dragon Balls

53
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
that made you small in the
first place, remember?!

54
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
And the only way
you're ever going to

55
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,041
get back to your normal
size is right here!

56
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,125
[DENDE] But if you attempt
to use them once more,

57
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,291
they will be sent to the
distant corners of space,

58
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,208
and we'll have
to start all over.

59
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,541
And that would mean

60
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,541
the Earth would have to
wait another entire year.

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,541
Say what?! So,
you're telling me

62
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,833
that my Grandpa has to
stay smaller than me?

63
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,125
Because I do not like
having a kid brother

64
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,916
tagging around all the time!

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,083
Yeah, but you have to--

66
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,875
I don't want to hear
about it! Oh. Wait a second.

67
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,500
We'd just have to
take another trip

68
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,291
around the universe to locate
all the Dragon Balls.

69
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,750
You ready to go, Trunks!

70
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,041
Nope. You can count me out!

71
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,166
[GIRU]
No way!

72
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,791
Oh, the two of you
can be such cowards.

73
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,125
Pan, I actually like being
the size of a kid again.

74
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,333
It makes me feel better
about getting older.

75
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,166
And just what do you think
Grandma is gonna have to say?

76
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,458
You know she's not
going to be very happy!

77
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,375
Don't worry, I'll have a talk
with Chi Chi when I get home.

78
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,791
Now more importantly,

79
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,916
it's time we hand
over the Dragon Balls.

80
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,708
Okay... But good luck
convincing Grandma

81
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,250
to make your dinner
for the next year.

82
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,125
[PAN]
Here you go.

83
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,958
Hey, Goku! Giru and I are about
to head back to Capsule Corp.

84
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,166
You coming?

85
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,083
[GOKU] No! But tell your
parents I say hello!

86
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,666
[PAN] Hey Giru! Do you want
to come over to my house?

87
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,208
[GIRU]
No, no, no...

88
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,541
Wait. I bet he thinks I still
don't trust him. Silly 'bot.

89
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,250
[GIRU]
Caution Giru.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,458
You really did do an
amazing job out there Giru.

91
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,750
We couldn't have
done it without you.

92
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,375
Well, I'm off. Be careful
with the Dragon Balls, Dende!

93
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,083
Bye Giru! Come
visit me sometime!

94
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,583
[DENDE]
The Black Star Dragon Balls!

95
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,708
I bet Baby will be
happy to hear about

96
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,875
this little development.

97
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,416
[CROWD clamoring]
Get out of here!

98
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:39,416
[CROWD clamoring]

99
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,791
They're here!

100
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,666
[HERCULE]
What? Who's here?

101
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,250
Buu, is it true that
Goku arrived today?

102
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,125
Yes, they have.

103
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,541
[HERCULE] And Pan too?
[BUU] Mm-Hm...

104
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,250
[HERCULE laughing]

105
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,541
It feels like I've been
waitin' for them to get back

106
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,083
for a decade.

107
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,916
Ever since all this wacky stuff
started happenin' on Earth,

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,250
hidin' out here in Buu's
stomach has given me

109
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,916
plenty of time to cook up my
next amazingly masterful plan.

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,375
Buu figure you escape by now.

111
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,083
What, are you crazy?

112
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,041
Th-The weather is unbelievably
comfortable in here!

113
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,583
[HERCULE]
Buu! Call Goku over here!

114
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,750
[BUU] Too late for that.
He go home already!

115
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,583
Eh? Well in that case,

116
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,041
we'll just have to
re-schedule with him?

117
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,041
Now let's say hello!

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,333
[BUU laughing]

119
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,166
[HERCULE]
So, uh, did you get all of 'em?

120
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,291
Buu think so.

121
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,500
Hey Buu, didn't
I hear you correctly

122
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,333
when you were talkin' about
some weirdo runnin' around town,

123
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,041
layin' eggs inside
people's bodies?

124
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,041
Oh sure. That was
that guy named Baby.

125
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,666
In fact, he left a deposit

126
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,458
that's sitting
right next to you.

127
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,500
Woah, say what!

128
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,666
[BUU] Just look around,
it's real gooey.

129
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,250
[HERCULE whimpering]

130
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,916
Buu does think he
gave me a dud though

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,625
because it still
hasn't hatched.

132
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,375
Guess Buu no need no more!

133
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,916
[HERCULE]
Thanks Buu. I owe you one!

134
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,875
[HERCULE] Y-You don't see that
B-Baby guy in the crowd, do ya?

135
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,541
[BUU]
Hm...

136
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,875
No, no. Buu see no Baby.

137
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,958
[HERCULE]
How tough are these guys?

138
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,083
[BUU]
Not as tough as you.

139
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,166
[HERCULE] Oh really?
Sounds like the perfect time

140
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,041
to show off my skills!

141
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,250
Listen, Buu. Hurry up
and spit me outta here!

142
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,625
Surprise! I, Mr. Satan

143
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,958
am taking a stand
against this evil!

144
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,791
Allow me to demonstrate
how it's done!

145
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,875
Watch closely!

148
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,166
[HERCULE]
Well that was easy.

149
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,208
As you can see,

150
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,541
my skills are plenty
to combat this evil

151
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,416

00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,333
[GOKU]
Chi Chi! I'm home!

159
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,291
Mama, I'm home! Wait till
you hear all about my trip!

160
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,833
I actually recovered
every single Dragon Ball

161
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,875
all by myself!

162
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,208
Hey! Mama? I missed you!

163
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,625
Chi Chi, I am
absolutely famished.

164
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,916
Please tell me you're
making dinner soon!

165
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,333
Hey, Mama...

166
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,208
Grandpa gave the
Dragon Balls to Dende

167
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,625
so he could hide them
at Kami's Lookout.

168
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:39,125
Ow! That hurt. What's
the matter? Oh, yeah.

169
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,333
You're mad because I'm still the
size of an 8-year-old, right?

170
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,875
Chi Chi?

171
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,375
Oh mama, why are you mad?

172
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:58,416
Is it because I went to outer
space without your permission?

173
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,625
I promise, I'll never
do that again.

174
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,875
Why won't the two of you
even say anything to us?

175
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,500
Well, I wonder where

176
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,666
the big homecoming is
celebrating our return?

177
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,666
I can understand my father
not being able to make it,

178
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,500
but I figured at
least Mom and Bulla

179
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,958
would come say Hi.
Come on, Giru!

180
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,166
[GIRU] Giru, Giru, Giru...
Danger! Danger! Danger! Danger!

181
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,875
[GIRU]
Danger! Danger! Danger!

182
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,875
What's wrong with you, Giru?
This is a really safe place.

183
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,541
Ah, I get it!

184
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,916
This is your first time
meeting my father.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,541
[GIRU] Danger! Danger!
Trunks in Danger!

186
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,791
[TRUNKS] Well, you are right. My
dad can be kind of intimidating,

187
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,500
but you really
shouldn't worry about it.

188
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,583
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru.

189
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,708
[TRUNKS] My mom can be 
even more dangerous,

190
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,375
but I didn't tell you that!

191
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,083
[VEGETA]
You're late.

192
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,125
Hey, Dad!

193
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,416
[GIRU]
Danger!

194
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,375
[TRUNKS] Things took
longer than we expected,

195
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,875
but the Dragon Balls
have been--

196
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,625
[VEGETA] Sealed up and hidden
at Kami's Lookout I hear.

197
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,958
[TRUNKS] Uh, yeah. That's right.
Dende took good care of them.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,458
[VEGETA]
Ah, okay. Then come on in.

199
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,833
[TRUNKS] Boy, it sure feels good
to be home after all this time.

200
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,291
[BULMA]
Welcome home, Trunks.

201
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,500
[TRUNKS]
Mother!

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,250
You know, Trunks... You've
been a bad boy recently.

203
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,083
Huh?

204
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,833
[GIRU]
Giru Giru...

205
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,541
[BULMA] I'll let your father
deal with your punishment.

206
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,208
[TRUNKS]
What's going on here?

207
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,250
I just got home and you
guys are mad at me?

208
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,625
[VEGETA chuckling]

209
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,833
It's been quite a
long time, eh, son?

210
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,250
Uh, yeah, it seemed
like an eternity.

211
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,083
Yes. Last time was
on the planet M2.

212
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,750
[BABY VEGETA]
Right, Saiyan?

213
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,833
You're not... Who are you?!

214
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,083
[BABY VEGETA chuckling]

215
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,500
I'm not your father.

216
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,416
You're T-20-O-6,
aren't you?

217
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,416
Stop acting like a fool,
you rusty piece of trash!

218
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,041
[GIRU]
Giru, Giru.

219
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,916
Giru, careful! It's not my dad!

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,625
[BABY VEGETA]
No thanks to you, simple bot,

221
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,958
my plans were postponed.

222
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,666
But due to your betrayal,

223
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,750
you have led me straight

224
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,916
to the remaining
Saiyan trash on my list.

225

00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,000
Giru!

00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,500
[BABY VEGETA cackling]

229
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,083
Get ready, my son...

230
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,125
We shall call this day
your new birthday,

231
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,875
because you'll never
be the same again!

232
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,083
Dad! What has come over you?!

233
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,375
[BABY VEGETA cackling]

234
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,416
Have you forgotten already?

235
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,416
I've entered your
body once before

236
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,583
and I'll do it again.

237
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,583
[TRUNKS groaning]

238
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,541
[TRUNKS panting]

239
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,625
[BABY VEGETA] Ah, so I
see you do remember me.

240
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,875
You never knew this,

241
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
but in the short time
I controlled your body,

242
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,291
I managed to lay
my egg inside of it.

243
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,583
[TRUNKS grunting]

244

[BABY VEGETA cackling]

246
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,833
Uh... Hey Chi Chi.
Are you still angry?

247
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,583
Because my stomach is
barking at me for food.

248
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,583
All of this stuff looks so
good I can't wait to dig in!

249
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,333
With all the work we put
into getting the Dragon Balls,

250
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,916
you're treating us as if
we've done something wrong!

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,458
It's crazy!

252
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,416
Hey, I'm dying here!

253
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:29,583
Shut up! There isn't enough food
here for either of you Saiyans!

254
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,291
[GOKU]
What are you talking about?

255
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:35,000
There's enough here
for at least four people.

256
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,875
[GOTEN]
You're forgetting me!

257
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,958
Hey... Goten!
How are you doing, son?

258
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,500
Look at you.

259
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,166
You've gotten so much bigger
since the last time I saw you.

260
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,166
All of you Saiyans
are such eyesores!

261
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,458
Goten?

262
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,458
And don't forget
my brother here!

263
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,000
Ah. It's been awhile, eh Dad?

264
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,416
Papa!

265
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,166
Grandpa, what's going on here?

266
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,333
I have no clue. But I know
it's not looking too good.

267
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,916
[GOTEN] Gohan, he should
be happy with our find.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,083
[GOHAN]
Yes. I think so.

269
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,500
But why don't we have some
fun with the two of them

270
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,583
until he arrives.

271
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,000
What do you mean, "he"?

272
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,000
Papa! Uncle Goten!

273
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,125
What are you about to do?
Hey Mama! Grandma Chi Chi!

274
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,500
Kill Goku now!

What's going on?! Are you
trying to destroy the city?

279
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:02,708
The city? Try the entire planet!

280
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,333
We're gonna blow this planet
away with the rest of you guys.

281
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,875
What's happened
to the two of you

282
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,666
since your father's been gone?

Hey, what is this?

I save the Earth just to be
beaten up by my own Dad?

How can you save Earth

291
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,416
when you can't even beat me?

...do something wrong or...
why does my dad... hate me...

I can tell, yes I am!

00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,583
Oh... How dare
a barbaric Saiyan

315
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,250
call my brother an amateur!

316
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:27,250
And how dare you, 
Gohan... call me barbaric!

317
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,166
Now that was funny!

318
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,166
[BOTH grunting]

319
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,875
As far as I can tell,

320
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,416
you two are neither
Saiyan nor Earthling.

321
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,166
You're just kids
with inflated egos!

322
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,208
[GOKU yelling]

323
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,750
[GOKU yelling]

324
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,375
[GOKU yelling]

325
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:03,125
[BABY GOHAN laughing]

326
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:11,791
[BOTH laughing]

327
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,708
Okay, boys... I really
don't want to do this,

328
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,208
but you leave me
no other choice!

329
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:24,208
Ka... Me... Ha... Me...

330
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,125
[HERCULE]
Hey up there! Stop!

331
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,875
Goku! Stop it!

332
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,875
Mr. Satan?

333
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:36,416
[HERCULE] Goku! Baby is
controlling Gohan and Goten!

334
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,583
He got in their heads and
jacked up their minds!

335
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,250
The entire human race
is under Baby's control!

336
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,541
[GOKU]
How could I let this happen?

337
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,916
[HERCULE whimpering]

338
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,541
[BUU growling]

339
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,041
Don't you understand
what's going on yet, Dad?

340
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,583
We have been re-born
at the mercy of Baby,

341
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,625
the Master of all Tuffles!

342
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,083
[BABY VEGETA]
Reborn as Tuffles, you mean.

343
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,625
No way! Not you, Vegeta!

344
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,500
Yes, Goku.

345
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,166
[NARRATOR] Goku and the
others arrived home

346
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,666
too late to stop
Baby's takeover.

347
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,541
But with Earth under siege
and all her people infected,

348
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,000
Goku will have to fight
family and friends

349
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,916
to end Baby's madness.

350
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,375
The battle between the Saiyans
and the Tuffles continues

351
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,500
on the next Dragon Ball GT!
