Don't hurt me!

[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball GT...

7
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,875
Taking away my
sight still leaves me

8
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,708
with four very sharp senses.

9
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,708
[NARRATOR] After being
blinded by Eis Shenron,

10
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,625
Goku struck back
and put an end

11
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,541
to the devious dragon's
plans of domination.

12
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:52,333
But no matter what he tried,
his eyesight would not return.

13
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,750
[NUOVA] I will not challenge
you again until you can see.

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,916
Seek me out then.

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,916
[NARRATOR] But when it seemed
Goku was safe for the moment,

16
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,166
a new evil made
his presence known.

17

Nuova!

18
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,583
It's a pitiful dragon that
gives allowances to a monkey.

19
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,250

Me...

23
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,625
Ha!

24
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,958
[SYN] You certainly
did it all right, Goku,

25
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,375
but none of it
seemed to hurt me.

26
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,250
What you're
learning right now,

27
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,875
is that you are simply
not strong enough.

28
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,250
Something's wrong...

29
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,625
[NARRATOR] As Goku's
confusion swells, Syn Shenron,

30
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,791
the final Shadow Dragon,

31
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,916
is confident in his ability
to strip victory away

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,958
while Goku is at
his most vulnerable.

33
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,625
Will Goku be able to
triumph in this final hour?

Find out today on
Dragon Ball GT!

35
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,875
It's too bad...

36
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,375
But the comfort
you've always felt

37
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,500
at being called the strongest
fighter in the galaxy

38
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,958
will come to an end today.

39
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,750
No more will the word "Saiyan"
mean anything but failure.

[GOKU grimaces]

42

Too much time and energy
has been wasted on you

to bother with anymore.

44
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,791
Good-bye, Goku.

[GOKU's heart beating slowly]

[GOTEN]
Father!

47
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,541
[SYN] Ah, the
reinforcements are here.

48
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,041
That's a pretty harsh way
to rescue someone, Majuub.

49
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,833
But thanks!

50
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,916
Sorry, Goten. I didn't
have time to think it out.

51
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,500
Goten and Majuub...?

52
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,625
Well, here I am rushing
to save the day...

53
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,666
And it turns out Majuub seems to
have everything under control.

54
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,375
But still, you made
the effort to be here.

55
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,833
Hey Dad, are you
gonna be okay?

56
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:04,208
Gohan? And Trunks too?
You all came?

00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
Papa! You're here!

58
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,583
Pan, don't bother them now.

00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,875
[HERCULE]
They got work to do.

60
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,250
Can't I hug my own dad?

61
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,375
Mama, what are you doing here?

62
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,166
We came to watch Goku fight and
to help him out if he needs it.

63
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,916
We figured that the world has
to have gone completely mad

64
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,166
if the Dragon Balls
have turned against us.

65
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,416
And if that's the case,

66
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
I'm gonna spend every
second with my family

67
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,708
and support them
as best I can.

68
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,000
We're behind you every
step of the way, Goku.

69
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,041
Now go make things right!

70
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,375
You're all here so
we can fight together.

71
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,125
I appreciate it,
but understand...

72
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,208
Even if we attack
him as a group,

73
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,791
he's still too powerful.

74
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah, we know that.

75
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,000
Huh?

76
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,333
You always taught me that
a great fighter knows the odds,

77
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,708
and the odds here are that even
if we all fight as a unit,

78
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,625
we still don't stand a
chance of beating him.

79
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,375
But, you're here.

80
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,583
We are, but you're the only
one who can beat this guy, Dad.

81
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,291
Come on, you can't tell
me you're not used

82

to hearing that
one by now.

83

We came here so you could
use all of our strengths.

You have to borrow
our Saiyan powers.

to their hero.

Have any of you taken a look
at that decrepit creature?

90
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,750
Does he really look like
the savior of Earth?

91
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,958
Do you actually think

92
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,083
that lending him your
strength will help?

I sure do.

My father was the galaxy's
greatest fighter,

95

and he was doing it long
before you were even born.

You're history.

You know, we're all here
because we believe in you.

You can do this, father.

Well, I'm not a Shenron,

so I can't make you guys
any guarantees about this,

but I promise I'll do my best.

102
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,125
And if I'm going
to stick to that,

103
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,375
I'll have to take the
absolute maximum power

It's time to finish the game.

I'll take on all of
you, and still win.

You'll only fight one of us,

You won't be able

Not only can I still
tell up from down,

that you're starting to sweat.

What's going on?

With the extra energy Goku's

has skyrocketed past

I'd be running
away from... if I were you.

It's useless...

Even though I'm blind
my body compensates

for it in amazing ways.

Can you sense the
evil of this clock?

No, because it has no
evil for you to sense.

It was a good theory.

up against that?
