the immobilized Baby

Okay, enough bluffing, Goku.

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,583
I practically
have no power left

10

and my legs feel like
they're made of jelly.

If my body can't handle
what I need to do,

12
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,666
then I'll have to force him
to make his own mistakes.

from Baby except his wits,

00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,166
[PAN] Grandpa had that giant
monkey on the ground!

159
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,208
But then Bulma
used this huge tower

160
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,083
to send out all these waves--

161
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,541
He's coming!

162
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,583
[BABY]
The little brat's right!

163
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,500
I cannot let him
power up again!

164
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,583
[GOHAN]
Look out!

165
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,500
[GOHAN] Trunks! Goten! We
need to give him the slip

166
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,541
so we can give Dad our energy!

167
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,583
[BOTH]
Right!

[BABY GORILLA roaring]

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,833
This isn't good! He's
keeping them all on the run!

174
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,416
They don't even have time
to gather around Goku,

175
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,583
let alone give
him their energy!

00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,041
Thanks, son.

185
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,916
for that trick with your lives!

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,541
He's mad!

[PAN]
It's over, isn't it?

188
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,166
[BABY] Behold! Witness
the glorious extinction

189

of the Saiyan race!

Hey it's Majuub! I'm sensing
his energy signal! He's alive!

[BABY] This pain is unbearable!
It's that kid! It has to be!

203
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,083
But how?! He was a
piece of chocolate.

204
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,333
[MAJUUB yelling]

205
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,333
How do you like your
chocolate surprise now, Baby!

206
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,833
You should really be a lot more
careful about what you eat!

207
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,458
[SS4 GOKU] Awesome! He knew
he could reverse the spell!

208
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,958
He got swallowed on purpose!

209
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,083
[BABY]
You little scoundrel! You knew!

210
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,791
You tricked me into eating you!

211
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,041
Isn't that how
you operate, Baby?

212
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,666
You lay your eggs in people and
attack them from the inside!

213
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,083
[BABY]
Curse you!

214
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,500
[MAJUUB groaning]

[MAJUUB yelling]

216
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,375
Goku! What are you waiting for?!

217
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,458
I can't keep this
up much longer!

218
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,500
This is our last chance!

219
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,333
[KIBITO]
Goku! He's doing this for you!

220
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,625
Now I get it!

221
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,208
Thanks, Majuub! Nice work!

222
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,500
When this is over,

223
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,500
we'll have another sparring
session together!

224
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,166
[SS4 GOKU]
Let's do it, guys!

225
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,333

Yeah!

Wait for me!

00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,000
Pan, come back!
What are you doin'?!

228
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,916
She just wants to help!
Let her go!

229
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,666
But she's just a little girl!
Not a Super Saiyan!

230
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,708
That's true! But she certainly
has the heart of a Super Saiyan!

231
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,416
[BABY GORILLA groaning]

232

great! I can feel it working!

Goku! The monkey's on the loose!

240

Majuub has been spit out, Goku!

241
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,458
Baby's free!
There's no more time!

242

Hold tight, guys! He'll
tell us when he's ready!

Almost there!
Just a little more!

and die like sitting ducks!

made it easier on me!

All five of them, standing
there like a giant bulls-eye!

Fools! How could
they fight so grandly

256
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,833
just to botch it up
like that at the end?

257

Oh, no! Please! Not my Pan!

Where are you?

[HERCULE]
Oh no! I'm all alone!

You know I can't
live without you.

261

You were everything to me, Pan!

How dare you hurt
my Granddaughter,

you ugly brute! Come on!

I ain't scared of you!

Better let me handle this one!

00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:50,583
[BABY] It can't be! Where
did that voice come from?

270
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,833
[BABY] It should be over!
I had you! What happened?!

271
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,958
She's alive!
Thank goodness!

You saved our Granddaughter!

Hi, Pan!

276
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,333
Hi, Gramps. Are we dead?

277
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:36,291
No, Pan! We're still alive!
Alive and well! Thanks to Goku!

278

[SS4 GOKU] You're a real
hero now, Mr. Satan!

279
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,875
You should be proud of yourself!

280
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,625
[HERCULE]
I should? Really?

281
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,208
You stood up to
Baby without fear,

282
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,458
without any regard
for your own life!

283
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,333
And that's what it's all about!

284
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,750
I really did, didn't I?
I don't believe it.

285
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,958
So that's what a fully powered
Super Saiyan Four is like!

286
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,083
Wow! Dad's power,
it's incredible!

287
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,916
This goes way beyond anything
I ever thought possible!

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,916
There's no way to describe it!

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,625
[SS4 GOKU] I couldn't have
reached this without

290
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,416
each one of you! You
all made sacrifices!

291
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,916
And now it's my turn!
The killing stops here!

292
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,958
All you see is the light shining
through the cracks around

293
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,333
the edges of the door, Baby!

294
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,750
And you just don't think
that little bit of light

295
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,625
can overcome your dark plans!

296
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,083
But what you can't see
is what's behind the door!

297
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,791
That's what I am!

298
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,750
[BABY] I don't care
what you are!

299
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,125
Your flesh can bleed and
your bones can be broken!

300
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,958
Funny! I have no
wish to destroy you!

301
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,916
It's your own desires
that make it necessary!

302
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,833
[BABY] Why you insolent,
presumptuous rat!

[NARRATOR]
In a twist of cosmic irony,

306
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,333
Goku must confront
the same nefarious power

307
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,541
that his ancestors destroyed
countless lives with.

308
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,458
Is there anything Goku can do

309
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,208
to put the sins of the Saiyans
to bed once and for all?
