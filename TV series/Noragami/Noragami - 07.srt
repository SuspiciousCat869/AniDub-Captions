1
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,704
From what I could see, he was ailing badly.

2
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,662
I shouldn't have let him go like that.

3
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:22,900
Kazuma.

4
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,186
I am here.

5
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:27,502
Come outside.

6
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:34,182
Report.

7
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,319
Yes.

8
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,162
Three days have passed since the Vent was opened.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,829
With the help of affiliated and unaffiliated shrines,
we have erected a barrier that has halted its growth.

10
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:49,551
However, the Phantoms that have already
come out will need to be dealt with.

11
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,114
Have you located Yato yet?

12
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:55,819
My Lady, I...

13
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,208
Well? Yes?

14
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,938
We're alone here. Speak your mind.

15
00:01:06,162 --> 00:01:08,571
You really shouldn't leave your hair wet like this.

16
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:10,127
You'll catch cold.

17
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:17,680
As you wish.

18
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,806
What kind of battle was that, Lady?

19
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:24,306
You acted on a personal grudge,
without thinking about others.

20
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,887
As a master it was completely irresponsible, Veena.

21
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:28,733
That's enough.

22
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,678
Dealing with the fallout from
the Vent is our priority now.

23
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,694
It was my fault the damn thing was opened.

24
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:45,013
I am duty-bound to exterminate those Phantoms.

25
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,695
Prepare to go hunting.

26
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:50,244
Now that is the lady I follow.

27
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,185
Kuraha! Kinuha! Yugiha!

28
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:56,515
Akiha! Karuha! Kazuha! Tsuguha!

29
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:00,500
Let's go!

30
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:34,287
Yukine?

31
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,499
Are you awake yet?

32
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,371
I brought breakfast, so I hope you're hungry!

33
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,329
Thanks, Hiyori.

34
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:43,293
Sounds great.

35
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:45,262
What the...?

36
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,121
What are you doing here, Yato?

37
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,454
You weren't invited! Where's Yukine?

38
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:51,211
Oh, he ran away.

39
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,108
He's probably over at Tenjin's place.

40
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:56,580
He ran away, and you didn't stop him?

41
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:00,329
Why would I? It's not like I need him right now, anyway.

42
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,597
Ah, hello there, dear.

43
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,231
Hi, Lord Tenjin!

44
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:16,579
Whatever is the matter?

45
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,303
Having school troubles?

46
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:21,079
I'm sorry. I'm looking for Yukine.

47
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:23,995
Ah. I saw him. He came by this morning.

48
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:28,246
I'd like to work for you instead of Yato. Can I do that?

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,067
Hm.

50
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,162
So, the new kid only lasted a month, huh?

51
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,841
That doesn't seem like long. How
long were you Lord Yato's Regalia?

52
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:36,912
Three whole months.

53
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:37,746
Wow!

54
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,971
I don't know how you did it!

55
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,204
No way I'd be able to.

56
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:41,371
That sounds impossible.

57
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:42,767
That's enough, ladies.

58
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,825
It does seem early to have decided you
no longer want Lord Yato as your master.

59
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,738
Is there a specific reason?

60
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,537
I can't stand the guy. Isn't that enough?

61
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:55,819
He doesn't have a shrine, he's broke,
he's obnoxious, he has a screwed-up past.

62
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:59,674
And besides, he already has a Regalia.

63
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,599
So, there you go.

64
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,746
Why should I waste time hanging
around with a guy like that?

65
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,783
Hm.

66
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:11,746
While I'm flattered and delighted you would ask for my
help, I fear it wouldn't be appropriate for me to agree.

67
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,591
You wouldn't want me to give you a name right now, child.

68
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,678
Doing that would make you a Nora, you see.

69
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,087
Nora.

70
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:26,421
Sorry, but what does that mean, exactly?

71
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,912
Until now I thought it was just someone's name.

72
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,291
How should I explain?

73
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,912
Noras are embarrassing.

74
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,779
Private parts of a god's life, you know.

75
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:35,967
Get it? Private parts.

76
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:36,437
Huh?

77
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,140
My lord.

78
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,921
Perhaps you should restrain yourself.

79
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:46,730
It's only a figure of speech, Tsuyu.

80
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,991
I'm not trying to scandalize the girl!

81
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,437
What is a Nora?

82
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,162
A Nora is a Regalia with many owners.

83
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,387
Not unlike a stray cat, for comparison.

84
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:03,329
But those who choose to go by many names are seen as
less reliable and more likely to betray their masters.

85
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,739
As such, they are looked down upon, despised.

86
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:13,704
Think of it his way. What if I offered to become your
godfather? I'll give you a pretty new name and everything.

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,496
It'll be fun. I would make a great godparent!

88
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,194
Huh?

89
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:21,079
Now, what would be a good
name? Yumi, maybe? Or Tomo? Yuko?

90
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,996
Um, thanks a lot, but no.

91
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,371
See? It feels disrespectful, even a bit wrong, doesn't it?

92
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,313
Yeah...

93
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:30,493
The kind of idea that people instinctively recoil from.

94
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,912
And that's how Noras are seen.
Why they are regarded with such hate.

95
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,158
They're that bad?

96
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,676
Oh, yes. Normally, a Regalia has but
one name and serves only one master.

97
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:51,454
It is commonly accepted that to serve a new master,
one must first be "unnamed" by the previous master.

98
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,110
Just as Mayu was.

99
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:56,912
If they're so reviled, why do Noras even exist?

100
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,680
For unsavory tasks.

101
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:04,905
To put it another way, they're generally used to
perform jobs you wouldn't give to your own Regalias.

102
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:13,656
Um... Lord Tenjin. I wonder if you
know a girl Nora I met a little while ago.

103
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:15,429
About the same age as Yukine, I think...

104
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:16,819
Please, that's enough.

105
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,236
We don't like to talk about Noras.

106
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:22,507
The very mention of them sends shivers down our spines.

107
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,343
Oh.

108
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:26,204
Though my lord does seem to speak freely of them.

109
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:31,494
No need to worry. I've never made
use of one before, nor do I intend to.

110
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:36,597
I have no wish to entangle myself
with such wretched creatures as Noras.

111
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:51,434
Don't forget that you can always use me.

112
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:53,202
Nora.

113
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:58,862
I've never stopped watching you in all this
time, and yet you never call for me anymore.

114
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:01,034
I've been so lonely.

115
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:07,291
That new boy is unstable. You should just get rid of him.

116
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,350
It's not like you don't have options.

117
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,010
I can be useful.

118
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,344
Much more useful than he can.

119
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,102
I've looked all over.

120
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,603
Where is he?

121
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:41,301
I smell someone, but it isn't Yato.

122
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,489
It's Bishamon!

123
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,537
That confirms it. You can see us.

124
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:01,509
You're one of Bishamon's people!

125
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:04,110
And you're that strange living spirit.

126
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,170
The half-Phantom from before.

127
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,454
Yato has many odd acquaintances.

128
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:10,336
I don't know why I'm surprised.

129
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,214
I'm going to die!

130
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:17,278
Restraint.

131
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:22,996
I can't move a single inch.

132
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:27,775
Umbra.

133
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,787
Okay. Okay.

134
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,079
Maybe a god will come to my rescue.

135
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:50,079
Aaahh! Yep! I'm totally dead!

136
00:09:50,162 --> 00:09:53,121
Progress? Do you have a location on the next Phantom?

137
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:53,678
No.

138
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,216
There aren't any here, milady.
Or none that I can smell, anyway.

139
00:09:58,537 --> 00:09:59,868
Kuraha's correct.

140
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,687
We have pretty much cleared out this entire area.

141
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,600
All that remains is the south-southeast region.

142
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:06,775
Oh?

143
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,404
Wait a sec.

144
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,022
They don't even realize I'm here?

145
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:14,343
It's a bit soon, but let's try widening the area.

146
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,378
Indeed. I'll catch up with you
once I've conducted one final search.

147
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:19,632
Very well, then.

148
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:23,496
I'm sorry, Kuraha. I know your wounds haven't healed yet.

149
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,611
Don't worry, milady. This is nothing.

150
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,412
Look after her. I'll follow soon.

151
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:29,578
Right!

152
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:33,088
Interesting.

153
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,316
They're nothing like Lord Tenjin or Kofuku.

154
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:40,200
They work as one big team. I
didn't know that was possible.

155
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,298
I wouldn't meddle if I were you, Hiyori Iki.

156
00:10:44,537 --> 00:10:45,815
It could be dangerous.

157
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:51,287
Hey! How do you know what my name is?

158
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,892
And, uh, what did you just do to me?

159
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,018
It's a talent of mine: Manipulating the things around me.

160
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,421
It often comes in handy, given my
line of work. Would you like this back?

161
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,698
Hey! You have my wallet!

162
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,728
But when could you have...?

163
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,121
You should be more careful.

164
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:14,577
If you cross paths with Bishamon again, keep
your head down, or things could go badly for you.

165
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:20,578
I still don't understand why you helped me.
I was under the impression you hated Yato.

166
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,037
Make no mistake.

167
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:24,811
He is certainly our enemy.

168
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:26,316
However...

169
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,904
I also owe him a great deal.

170
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:41,412
Speaking of which, is he doing alright?

171
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:41,908
Huh?

172
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,752
He was blighted. It looked to be pretty severe.

173
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:46,913
It's that bad?

174
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:51,589
The blight's source wasn't external.
It most likely came from the inside.

175
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:54,882
Yato's Regalia.

176
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,837
"Sekki" in that form, right?

177
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:59,662
It should be disposed of as soon as possible.

178
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,792
What do you mean?

179
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:07,003
There's nothing to worry about!
Yukine's a good kid. He used to be human!

180
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,787
Isn't killing Regalias like killing people?

181
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:13,287
It was a long time ago, but Yatty did kill a Regalia once.

182
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,445
He kills people, too, sometimes.

183
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,688
Something must be done before it's too late.

184
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:24,930
If a Regalia repeatedly does wrong,
its master will fall seriously ill.

185
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:28,746
If left untreated, the pain will intensify.

186
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,198
The blight will spread throughout
the body, growing ever worse.

187
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:39,295
Honestly. Why is he even using such a Regalia?

188
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:40,235
Huh?

189
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,611
You appear to be his close companion.

190
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,537
Has he not mentioned anything about it to you?

191
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,487
Uh, no, he hasn't.

192
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:49,776
I know this may seem an odd request.

193
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,606
But please look after Yato.

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,090
I'd hate to lose him like this.

195
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,129
Right. I'll see what I can do.

196
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,597
Yukine must be dealt with.

197
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,912
If that doesn't happen soon...

198
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,556
Damn it! Stupid, useless old geezer!

199
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,617
Got rejected, did ya?

200
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:21,409
Shut up!

201
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,702
Well? What do you want?

202
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:28,011
We got a job. You coming?

203
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,510
Gotta skim the soup.

204
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:46,763
You call this a job? Are you kidding?

205
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:50,036
You suck at being a god! Try a temp agency instead!

206
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:53,841
Quiet, you whiney brat! This is
an honest job for an honest client.

207
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:57,015
The shop would have to close its
doors without late night help like us!

208
00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:59,662
Oww! Hot! Hot! Hot!

209
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:02,317
This sucks. Seriously.

210
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:04,114
Why do I put up with this kinda crap?

211
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,329
Oh, you're actually here.

212
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:10,503
And so are you.

213
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,781
Hey there, Yatty!

214
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:14,599
No! Not her!

215
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,204
No gods of poverty wanted here!

216
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,454
You punk!

217
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:21,519
Think I'll let you touch my lady like that?!

218
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,829
It's justice and you know it!

219
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:28,829
You two go around tricking people with
that fake name of hers. It's just plain shady!

220
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:32,454
She uses a trade name! Plenty
of other places do the same thing!

221
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:38,912
Owie! Rub my boo-boo, Yori. It hurts!

222
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:41,221
There, poor thing. Does that help?

223
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,315
Hiyori?

224
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:45,100
How's your latest gig?

225
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:53,246
We love Yori. She's been so helpful.
She brought us straight to you!

226
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:56,079
You brought them?
How'd you even know where I was, though?

227
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,185
Um... actually, it's your sm...

228
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,246
Same thing when we asked. She won't cough it up.

229
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,371
"Cough it up"? What are you, a gangster?

230
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,120
Well? Whatcha doin' here?

231
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:10,721
We got a job that's not our style.
So we were gonna see if you wanted it.

232
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,297
You do want it, don't you?

233
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:16,107
I guess I could take it.

234
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:20,916
Hey, uh, you're looking a little pale. How do you feel?

235
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,864
Aw, man. Couldn't afford dinner again?

236
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,091
Yukine.

237
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,992
What'd you do this time?

238
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:36,787
What?

239
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,569
You don't really think I stole
money, do you? That's messed up.

240
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:52,284
Oh, come on, man. Even a god's given up on me. Great.

241
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,740
I was better off being dead than working for you.

242
00:16:09,223 --> 00:16:12,598
So Yato was right. You did steal it.

243
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,204
Oh dear. That's bad.

244
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:26,413
I'll take that job, thanks.

245
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:28,537
You guys'll stay and look after the shop, right?

246
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,114
Huh?

247
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:30,890
Wait! Get back here!

248
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,508
That'll be 582 yen, please!

249
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,020
Thanks fer your business, sir.

250
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,470
All it says is to "eliminate the
Phantom that has appeared above Kamiido."

251
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,498
That's a simple enough job.

252
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:52,610
Yeah. I'll bet branch shrines are getting lots of
these types of requests since the Vent was opened.

253
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,004
Yato.

254
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,621
About Yukine...

255
00:16:56,704 --> 00:17:00,324
I'll find him. Can't do much
Phantom slaying without a Regalia.

256
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,180
That's why you really gotta
keep track of the things, you know?

257
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,082
No. I wasn't asking... I mean, what I wanted...

258
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,746
How do I say this?

259
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,034
I know. I get it.

260
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,307
This problem needs to be put to rest.

261
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,496
It should be disposed of as soon as possible.

262
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:36,427
Huh?

263
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,321
Whoa! You've finally lost it, haven't you?

264
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,118
Uh...

265
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:57,563
Yato.

266
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:58,617
Uh, yeah?

267
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,996
Regalias aren't tools. "Gotta keep track of the things"?

268
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:03,520
Huh?

269
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:07,954
Yukine isn't some <i>thing</i>. You
have to treat him like a person.

270
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:11,297
If you're not willing to do that,
how can you expect him to act like one?

271
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,348
Think about it, okay?

272
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,419
Sure. I will.

273
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,093
You have such pretty eyes for a boy.

274
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,593
They remind me of the fruit on hawthorn plants.

275
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:39,442
You know.

276
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,787
Not even birds will eat the hawthorn fruit.

277
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:50,067
Not because of their taste. They aren't
poisonous or anything. They're just empty, is all.

278
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:56,412
Useless, empty fruit. They offer nothing.
And of course nobody bothers to pick them.

279
00:18:56,496 --> 00:19:01,045
So they're left on the plant to wilt,
wither, and die as pointlessly as they lived.

280
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,037
Poor, lonely little boy.

281
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,605
Yukine!

282
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,010
What are you doing with him, Nora?

283
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:16,121
You know, Yato. You should really
use me more. Like you used to.

284
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,550
You know I'm good.

285
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:21,705
I can kill anything in your way with no trouble.

286
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,492
Come on.

287
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,162
Sekki!

288
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,810
Don't listen to anything Nora says. She's vindictive.

289
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:44,871
Focus on one thing... on that.

290
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:46,262
Now? Are you sure?

291
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,175
Wait! Yato!

292
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,454
This is the land of the rising sun.

293
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:10,109
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

294
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,787
Hear me. I am the god Yato.

295
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:18,329
I now lay thee waste with the
Sekki and expel thy vast defilement!

296
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,152
I cleanse thee!

297
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,887
Rend!

298
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:26,213
He can't cut through it?

299
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,823
You've gotta be kidding with this!

300
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,411
He's already gotten dull?

301
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,871
All the stings I've gotten
'cause of him. Now there's this?

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,996
Smells nice.

303
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,246
Hurry! Get out of there!

304
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:56,579
Smells nice, nice, nice, nice.

305
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,454
Purification water.

306
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,519
Go, Nora! Just get out of here!

307
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:25,121
He's a stupid punk with an attitude
problem, but I found him, and I named him.

308
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:28,162
Sekki! I will re-forge you!

309
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,215
Rend!

310
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:41,096
They did it!

311
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:48,822
Rejected you, huh?

312
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,703
So much for his reputation.

313
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:53,037
He's not the god he used to be.

314
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,148
Let's go.

315
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:13,693
Yukine must be dealt with.

316
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,898
If that doesn't happen very soon. Then Yato will die.

317
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:24,757
At this rate, he'll die.

318
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,662
Sorry for decking you like that earlier, man.

319
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:01,787
Don't worry about it.

320
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:02,787
Here.

321
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,579
