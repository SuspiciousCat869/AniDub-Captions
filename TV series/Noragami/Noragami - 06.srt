1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,081
Hey, Yukine?

2
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,366
You awake?

3
00:00:10,572 --> 00:00:12,419
I baked some cookies for you.

4
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,605
I'll just leave them by the door with some cocoa.

5
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:46,832
Hey, Yukine?

6
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,050
Dammit.

7
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,070
Border!

8
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,935
Why am I freaking out so much?

9
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:55,172
It's Yato's fault. Forcing me to kill that girl.

10
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,162
Stop!

11
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:06,017
Rend!

12
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:29,294
What you're doing's no different than stealing!

13
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:34,058
Damn! They won't get off of my ass! Even HiYori!

14
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:35,455
What the hell?

15
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,153
Hm? Hmph.

16
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:57,769
Damn kid.

17
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,253
Not in there, either.

18
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:12,514
Yukine's been so down since that last encounter.

19
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,923
And Yato hasn't even spoken to him.

20
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,078
I guess it's only natural for him
to feel this way after what happened.

21
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,191
Oh, hey! HiYori!

22
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:25,073
Hey!

23
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,597
Ami! Yama!

24
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,717
Don't you think that you should be at
home studying instead of wandering around?

25
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,568
What about you? We all have to take the exam.

26
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:36,032
Yeah, but we don't sleep through class all the time.

27
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:40,040
So we're pretty sure we'll be moving
on to the next grade with everybody else.

28
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,067
But we're starting to worry about you.

29
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,964
I'm doing plenty of studying, thank you very much.

30
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,137
Oh, hey. Have either of you seen a boy
wearing a green parka around anywhere?

31
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,721
He comes up to about here.

32
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:52,143
A boy, huh?

33
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:54,454
Yeah! He's kinda young.

34
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:56,685
Hm.

35
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,755
Oh, hello, Mrs. Iki? Your
daughter is in a torrid relationship!

36
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,216
And we're smack dab in the middle of exam season!

37
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:06,491
Ahh! No, don't listen to them, mom!
It's not like that, I promise you!

38
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:12,519
And you got a thing for ugly guys! I bet he's
hideous! Just look at your beloved Tono after he lost!

39
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,484
Don't show me that! I haven't gotten to that fight yet!

40
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,736
You better introduce us to your boyfriend!

41
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,000
Here's hopin' he looks like just like Tono!

42
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:23,246
Seriously, it's not like that!

43
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,537
Oh, man! I don't even know if the gods can help her now.

44
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:32,497
I actually would like to introduce
them to Yato and Yukine sometime.

45
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:38,446
Of course, there's not much point. They'd
probably forget they met them as soon as it happened.

46
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:40,434
And then...

47
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,670
I can't really pretend like I
know Yato all that well myself.

48
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,592
Man, that was too easy! Heh, hah!

49
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:03,013
Ha, ha! I can pretty much do anything I want!

50
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,106
What the hell's your problem?!

51
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,528
Yato!

52
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,893
Wanna tell me where you got this?

53
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,300
Um, well, HiYori bought it for me.

54
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:23,387
Uh-huh.

55
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,163
Yukine!

56
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:31,271
You've been with Yato? Oh, man, that's a relief.

57
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:37,849
HiYori, that was real nice of you to buy this for him.

58
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:39,238
Huh?

59
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:57,291
Uh. Oh, sure. I'm nice like that.

60
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:11,992
Man, I really can't stand kids.

61
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,197
That's one deep crimson sky.

62
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:22,459
Twilight serves as the boundary between day and night.

63
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:26,771
The people of this world, they
fear the darkness, and hide from it.

64
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:32,245
While the inhabitants of the other
world blend into the darkness and run wild.

65
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:37,106
With its reddish hue, the setting sun
blurs the distinction between the worlds.

66
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:41,642
As the evening shadows grow deeper
and harden into pervasive darkness.

67
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:46,444
This is the time when those lost in the
divide can most easily cross the boundary.

68
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:51,585
People once referred to this as the time of
day when the monsters emerged from their slumber.

69
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,875
Yukine, this time is known as...

70
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,408
The fiendish hour.

71
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:15,290
Oww.

72
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:19,046
Shh.

73
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:22,087
The hell?

74
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:27,280
Ya see what happens when I explain things to you?
I'm blaming you for the trouble that just landed on us.

75
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,542
I've found you at last god of calamity.

76
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,248
Hi, Bishamon.

77
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,194
Bishamon?

78
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,085
That's right.

79
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:38,928
The strongest war god that I wish I never met.

80
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,267
She's a god? Well, aren't you on the same side, then?

81
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,685
Why is she attacking us?

82
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,780
We tangled once a long time ago. And
she's been trying to kill me ever since.

83
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:48,424
Huh?

84
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:54,711
Then count me out of this one!
You can fight her on your own.

85
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,279
I dunno. I doubt she's gonna just let you walk away.

86
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:03,896
This is a matter of revenge for
her. She wants me and my Regalia.

87
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,289
Well thanks a lot!

88
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:10,383
My grudge may drive me to slay you both.
But the punishment of evil will make it just.

89
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,755
Come, Sekki!

90
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:19,673
Huh?

91
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,159
Wait!

92
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,324
You won't escape me!

93
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:40,601
Wait. The Bishamon, the god that punishes evildoers?

94
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,072
Revenge against Yato? She even wants to kill his Regalia?

95
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,143
If anything happens to me. I want
you to go straight to those two.

96
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:51,962
Do you understand?

97
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,857
Kazuma, I need you to track him.

98
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,778
Understood.

99
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:07,610
Target currently moving north-northeast. 2.1... 1.9...

100
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:11,782
The area is lightly crowded, but I
suggest restraint in your attacks.

101
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:16,131
Only one Regalia, abilities unknown.

102
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:21,714
Well, killing is the only thing Yato's
skilled at. Kuraha, deploy your pincer attack.

103
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:23,034
As you wish, milady.

104
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,812
You will die at my feet today.

105
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,722
Why the hell did you stop? She's gonna catch us!

106
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,878
Get off my ass. You're part of the
reason I'm so exhausted right now.

107
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:42,674
Huh?

108
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:45,353
Quit bein' such a pansy.

109
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:47,520
What? I am not a pansy.

110
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:48,957
I can feel it!

111
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,408
You've been stinging me nonstop with your crap!

112
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:57,170
How many times I gotta tell you that
your volatile emotional state affects me too!

113
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,376
Get it together!

114
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:02,060
But that woman. She's a god just like you.

115
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,087
Are you seriously gonna fight another god?

116
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,669
She's the one attacking us, okay?

117
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,570
And you're... gonna use me?

118
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:11,737
Obviously!

119
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:14,033
It's your job to kill what I want dead!

120
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:25,076
Everything Bishamon has with her, all of
her weapons, even her clothes and that beast.

121
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,009
They're all Regalias.

122
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,354
You're saying that lion's a Regalia?

123
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:35,176
You got it. On top of that, she's got Kazuma, who
handles her navigation and coordinates the other Regalias.

124
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,510
His all-seeing guidance makes Bishamon
the mightiest war god of them all.

125
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,829
Hey! Why aren't you hiding? She'll see us!

126
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:45,946
She'll find us no matter what!
I'm making a stand right here.

127
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,249
While I've still got some strength.

128
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,596
What? But I don't wanna fight her!

129
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,414
It's her!

130
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:04,943
So heavy! A full hit will snap the Sekki in two!

131
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,974
Catch him, kinuha!

132
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,066
It grabbed you! It's a Regalia?

133
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,282
I told you that! Now shut up and focus, Yukine!

134
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,079
Gaiki!

135
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:25,497
Locking on.

136
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,748
Targeting cervical vertebrae and
left humerus. Zero point in: 2... 1...

137
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,303
Fire!

138
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,290
Impressive.

139
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:45,048
Sorry.

140
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,159
Kinuha!

141
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,876
You evil scum!

142
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:55,100
How dare you!

143
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:59,415
I swear I'll never let you kill another Regalia!

144
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,752
Hold on. You've killed a Regalia?

145
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:04,943
Didn't I tell you to shut up, Yukine?

146
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:10,761
Get over it! You've been stalking me for years
now! Haven't ya got anything better to be doing?

147
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,667
Ya crazy half-naked tramp!

148
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,936
Your existence is an obscenity
to nature! I will eradicate you!

149
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:17,761
Suki!

150
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,083
The blade's dulled!

151
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,768
C'mon! Pull yourself together!

152
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:27,993
Damn!

153
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:32,687
Tch.

154
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,143
Kofuku!

155
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:38,155
Oh, hey, HiYori. What's going on?

156
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,924
Hi, Yori! Talk about perfect timing!
Which kind of Daifuku bun do you like better?

157
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,155
We have the kind with...

158
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,052
It's Yato! Bishamon's attacking him and Yukine!

159
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,155
Bishamon, huh?

160
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,828
Oh, jeez. I can't believe Bisha's still
trying to kill poor Yatty after all this time.

161
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,215
She called him... what was
it? A "god of calamity" I think?

162
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:03,133
What does that mean?

163
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:06,386
Just another way of saying
a god that causes disaster.

164
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,104
Huh?

165
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:11,844
Yatty's a scary war god. You haven't
already forgotten I told you that have you?

166
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:16,898
It was a long time ago, but Yatty did kill a Regalia once.

167
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,408
Wait a minute.

168
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:27,250
The Regalia Yato killed... does this
mean that it was Bishamon's Regalia?

169
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:35,089
This is only between Yato and Bishamon. It's
none of our business and I'm stayin' out of it.

170
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:38,537
Uh. But, Yato told me to come to you for help.

171
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,666
You just have to help him!
Please! What will he do without you?

172
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,364
You really are desperate to help him, huh? I
know, you've got a thing for Yatty, don't you?

173
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:52,971
Huh?! No, I don't! Honestly!

174
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:54,930
So he's blackmailing you then, isn't he?

175
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,116
Extortion? That's just awful!

176
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:00,116
There's not a single person who trusts him.

177
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:05,097
None of that. I still need his help with my body problem.

178
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:10,186
Don't you worry, Yori! I'm more than happy to help you!

179
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,591
Wow! Thanks!

180
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,092
You can just pay me your money offering later!

181
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:14,552
Huh?

182
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:19,417
Just remember you asked for this,
and don't blame me for the fallout.

183
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,488
So, where is Yato?

184
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,166
I'm actually not sure.

185
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:28,923
Oh, wait! Maybe I can find him!

186
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,419
Whoa! She has a cord!

187
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:38,976
She's a half phantom?

188
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:49,254
I've noticed that all of the
gods have a pleasant smell to them.

189
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:53,701
But that smell is slightly different for each one of them.

190
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,559
He's that way!

191
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:32,929
Yato.

192
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:33,652
Huh?

193
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:35,368
That lady,

194
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:39,961
the one that's chasing us.
Did you really kill her Regalia?

195
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,329
Yeah.

196
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,618
Then it's only natural she wants revenge on you.

197
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,195
Why'd you do it?

198
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,512
Because I wanted to, alright?

199
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,665
Nothing more.

200
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:58,461
So it's that easy for you then, huh?

201
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,606
Is what that easy?

202
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:01,457
And me?

203
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:03,951
Are you gonna kill me if I screw up?

204
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:06,597
Or if you just don't need me anymore?

205
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,433
Not that I matter to him.

206
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:11,038
Even without me.

207
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,786
He's still got that other Regalia, Nora.

208
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:21,612
You're stinging me again, dammit.
Seriously. Man up and get your head straight!

209
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:22,940
What?

210
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,500
Your fear is killing me here! It's
put me in a real slump! Freakin' wimp!

211
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,938
Hey, you're just as scared as I am!

212
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:30,597
What?!

213
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:33,717
Your hands are five times sweatier than usual, old drippy!

214
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,587
Who the hell you callin' old drippy?

215
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,761
I'm talkin' to you, aren't I, you moron!

216
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:42,063
Well it takes a moron to recognize
a moron! You freakin' moron!

217
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:47,756
Se-seki!

218
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:57,964
You're like a walking armory.

219
00:17:58,947 --> 00:17:59,726
And c'mon.

220
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,089
Did you hav'ta take out all those trees? Did
the forest kill one of your Regalia's as well?

221
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:08,932
I can overlook some immoral
collateral damage to purge evil.

222
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:12,435
Well it's a good thing you've got the
power of righteousness on your side then.

223
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,397
Make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?

224
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,157
Those will be your final words.

225
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:28,355
Whoa! We can't fight that!
That monster will tear me in half!

226
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:37,397
Yatty!

227
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:40,340
Found you!

228
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:41,475
Kofuku?

229
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,659
Lady kofuku?

230
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,487
Come to me, kokki!

231
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,245
Now pay attention to me, you two!

232
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,195
Is she?

233
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,301
Are you insane?

234
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:01,264
No more fighting!

235
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,580
What's happening? She blasted open a
vent! She can barely control that thing!

236
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,415
She's always causing storms with her kokki.

237
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:21,221
Phantoms are pouring from the underworld!

238
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,566
Lady Bishamon! We should retreat!

239
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,314
Stay the course! Kuraha!

240
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:31,621
Yato!

241
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:35,747
Kuraha.

242
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:41,883
Restraint.

243
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:48,454
Kinki!

244
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,302
Kazuma! Help kuraha.

245
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,509
Bastard!

246
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:00,847
Lady Bishamon.

247
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:02,439
We need to retreat for now.

248
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:06,313
He's right there! Just forget
about the vent! I demand justice!

249
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,059
Veena!

250
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,465
If you personally wish to be eaten
by phantoms, then go right ahead.

251
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:17,260
But tell me. Do you wish the
same for kuraha and the others?

252
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,614
Whoa, what in the world is that?

253
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,950
Dammit, HiYori, why'd you bring them here?

254
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,200
But wait, you told me to go to
them if you were ever in trouble!

255
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh. But I didn't mean this time!

256
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,602
I just never really expected I'd run into Bishamon.

257
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:37,866
Oh, no!

258
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:40,328
Well, regardless, you should hide.

259
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:40,860
Huh?

260
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,283
And don't say my name.

261
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,395
Bishamon can't find out you have any connection to me.

262
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,961
Oh, right!

263
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:54,469
Out of respect for lady kofuku,
I'll let you live for today.

264
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:59,513
But I will kill you the next
time we meet with my own hands.

265
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,462
So try not to get any more blight.

266
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,045
Let's go, Kazuma.

267
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,733
HiYori! It's dangerous here, we've gotta go!

268
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:27,447
Right!

269
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,674
Nice work back there, kofuku.

270
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:31,775
Pretty impressive, huh?

271
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,402
I'm being sarcastic! You screwed everything up!

272
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,039
You ingrate! She saved your sorry ass from death!

273
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,306
Ow, jeez!

274
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,375
That hurt, Daikoku!

275
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,488
It was supposed to!

276
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:48,479
There were some really high-force
winds blowing through the city at sundown.

277
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:53,411
I heard a whole patch of trees in the
woods were knocked down. How frightening.

278
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:05,282
No good. It just won't cleanse.

279
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:11,215
Yukine, is this just not gonna work?

280
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:16,279
Yato. Try not to look so down.

281
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:20,646
Don't forget that you can always use me.

282
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:23,438
Nora.

283
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,308
That's a deep crimson sky.

284
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:01,689
HiYori. The word crimson...

285
00:24:01,714 --> 00:24:05,560
"crimson" originally denoted the color
of a dye made from Kermes Vermilio, right?

286
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:06,913
Uh, yeah, sure.

287
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,884
Next time on Noragami: "Uncertainty and destiny."

288
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:10,998
You sure do know a lot.

289
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:13,039
Well, this is exam season.
