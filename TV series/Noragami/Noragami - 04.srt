1
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,222
Here, Lord Yato!

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,706
Will you say it? Please?

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,839
Ha! It is done. May our fates intertwine.

4
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:22,768
Woo! Man, nothin' beats a cup
of saké after a long day of work!

5
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:27,219
All these people. You have so many worshippers, my lord!

6
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,071
The streets are just filled with Yatoites!

7
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:34,609
Hm. About time. I knew the world
would catch up with me eventually.

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,920
Still, there is a certain emptiness
to having your ambition fulfilled.

9
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,608
The top is a lonely place to be. Nobody understands!

10
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,836
How it chills my heart!

11
00:00:45,277 --> 00:00:47,078
Oh, Lord Yato.

12
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,395
I am so very cold. Won't someone come
along to warm this frozen heart of mine?

13
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:53,004
I will! Let me!

14
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,462
No! Me, Lord Yato!

15
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,519
Hey, take it easy, now.

16
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,838
There's plenty of Lord Yato
to go around, la...

17
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,861
Oh, just shut up!

18
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,136
Hooray!

19
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:46,937
This looks great, thanks!

20
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:51,858
Eat all you want. But in exchange, I expect you
to stop dodging me and finally listen to my request!

21
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,851
This is my favorite! Score!

22
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,835
Are you even listening? You aren't, are you?

23
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:02,101
I'm tired. I barely got any rest, thanks
to mister talks-in-his-sleep over here.

24
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,759
Is that a normal thing for you?

25
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:06,322
Ah. that dream was something special!

26
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,616
Please! Like there'll ever be "Yatoites."

27
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,107
Yeah, you'll never get any followers dressing like that.

28
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:13,805
No one wants to worship a slob.

29
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:16,590
Especially girls. No girl would ever think that's cool.

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,785
Excuse me?

31
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,197
I mean, I wouldn't even give you so much as a handshake.

32
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,601
You know, right? His hands are
always sweaty. It's really gross!

33
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,832
I think it's time for me to show you

34
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,896
what a god is capable of.

35
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,392
It is fated to happen.

36
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,416
My dream will become real, and do you know why?

37
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,796
'Cause I bought this baby!

38
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:46,328
What's some old pot gonna do?

39
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:47,795
It's not just any pot!

40
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,894
I got it from a lady in town who read my palm and
declared she would sell it to me and no one else!

41
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,962
All I have to do is chant "happy-happy,
cool-cool, happy-happy, cool-cool"

42
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,317
every day while I rub it back and forth, see?

43
00:03:57,428 --> 00:03:58,627
And you believed her?

44
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,904
And this'll make me rich if I
place it on a west-facing wall.

45
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,586
And this bracelet will help
me build the home of my dreams.

46
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:07,626
And this pyramid is guaranteed
to boost my test scores!

47
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:10,825
With all these charms, wishes I
didn't even know I had will come true!

48
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,045
I'll be happy-happy, cool-

49
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,583
Heads up, Hiyori!

50
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,321
Jungle Tornado!

51
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,422
Try doing some work instead!

52
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,629
It's not my fault things have been slow.

53
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,670
I want to work, but I'm not getting any job calls.

54
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:36,906
No calls, no work.

55
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,518
You know, I've been thinking about what you said.

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,510
How gods and Regalias are together in mind and body.

57
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:48,351
You were lucky to find such a great Regalia.

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,129
Don't you think it's time to clean up your act a little?

59
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,626
Pull yourself together. Yukine's counting on you now.

60
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,587
Get up, Hiyori. Go get your body.

61
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:07,124
Huh?

62
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,934
There's somebody I want to introduce you to.

63
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,117
Uh...

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,181
Why'd we come here?

65
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:40,499
Kofuku!

66
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,721
Anyone here? Hey!

67
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,697
Huh?

68
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,122
Yatty!

69
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,233
Hey, long time no see, huh?

70
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,207
So, who do you think she is, anyway?

71
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,714
From the way they're greeting
each other, you'd think that...

72
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:01,825
No way. That'd be impossible.

73
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,403
Guys, this is Kofuku.

74
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:08,170
She's my girlfriend! Nice, huh?

75
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,295
Yatty and I go way, way back.

76
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,500
Nice to meet you!

77
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,196
Girlfriend? No way!

78
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,519
But she's a hottie!

79
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:18,487
Anyway, I've got a favor to ask you, my dear.

80
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,129
I'll do anything you want. You know that.

81
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:24,295
Here's the deal.
I recently made this kid into a Regalia.

82
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,593
Which is great, but work's kinda scarce lately, you know?

83
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,482
Breaks my heart.

84
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,337
I'd like to get him a hot meal in this weather.

85
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,410
But how can I when I haven't even
been able to provide shelter for him yet?

86
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,879
I think that's the saddest story I've ever heard!

87
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,587
Don't worry! I'll help you out.

88
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,166
Let me see what I have here.

89
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:43,420
There. Do you think this will be enough?

90
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,292
You're a life-saver! A real
sweetheart, that's what you are, baby!

91
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,379
Aw, do you really mean it?

92
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:53,462
I love it when you talk to me that way.

93
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:56,587
All right! Time to hit the pachinko parlor!

94
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,420
I'll come with you!

95
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,900
What a grade-A scumbag.

96
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:02,217
You dirty bastard!

97
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,826
What have I told you, huh?

98
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,712
Keep your hands off my lady or I will end you!

99
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,295
Whoa! It's an affair?

100
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,087
You hear me, ya rotten, stinkin', little punk?

101
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,796
Now! You gentlemen don't need to fight over little ol' me!

102
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:23,992
I'm Kofuku Ebisu's Regalia.

103
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,222
In weapon form the name's Koku.

104
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,317
As a person, I'm Daikoku.

105
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,221
This is cool. Ebisu's a pretty big name, right?

106
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah, one of the Seven Gods of Fortune.

107
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,516
Sure looks different in person, doesn't she?

108
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:41,170
What are you talking about over there?

109
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,023
Oh, nothing, really! Just about how
cute of a couple you are. That's all!

110
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:46,324
Couple?

111
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,004
Well, yeah. I mean, the two
of you are married, aren't you?

112
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:50,795
'Course not.

113
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,587
Huh? But what you called Goddess Ebisu earlier...

114
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,527
We're casual here. Kofuku's fine.

115
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,741
It's just that before, you called Kofuku your lady.

116
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,423
My lady, like a title. As in, she's my goddess.

117
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:03,312
Aren't you?

118
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,418
Mm-hmm!

119
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,587
I wonder what my tea leaves will say.

120
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,001
Reading tea leaves is a bogus practice.

121
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:10,962
What are you staring at?

122
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,029
Was there something you wanted to say to me?

123
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,291
No! No, there's nothing at all we'd like to say, sir!

124
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,087
Be careful. Don't look that guy in the eyes.

125
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,807
Huh?

126
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,086
Doing that can be dangerous.

127
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:24,030
You might never get away.

128
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,118
Despite his tough exterior...

129
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,706
He has a thing for kids like you!

130
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:34,718
Don't say it like that! You make me sound sick!

131
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,379
Don't get the wrong idea, okay?

132
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:45,504
My Daikoku loves kids! That's all Yatty meant.

133
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:47,087
Daikoku cares about children.

134
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,754
He could do nothing but sit and
watch them play all day long!

135
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,892
You see what ya did there? Now
I'm starting to sound creepy again.

136
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,629
Now. Let's talk, kid.

137
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,281
Quit it. Don't be ridiculous.

138
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,241
All right, boy. You're a Regalia?

139
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:02,614
What's your name?

140
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,722
Y-Yukine.

141
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,495
Been a Regalia long?

142
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,936
No, sir. Not long at all.

143
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:10,714
I just started, actually.

144
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,039
Hm. I see.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,816
Young for such a responsibility.

146
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,616
Do you think he's too young?

147
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,037
What about you?

148
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:25,918
Uh, sorry?

149
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:26,997
Do you have a name?

150
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,045
Yes, I'm Hiyori Iki.

151
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:32,148
Oh! I'll just call you Yori, okay?

152
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,217
That's fine.

153
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:36,170
You seem like you're just a regular human girl, Yori.

154
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,045
What's your relationship to Yatty?

155
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,765
What? Relationship?

156
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,754
I don't even care about the jerk.

157
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,170
Come on, now!

158
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,507
Why do you look so upset, huh?

159
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,706
What's wrong? Tell me, tell me!

160
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,422
I'm very sorry. My lady can be crazy sometimes.

161
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:55,212
You're a B-cup, aren't you? I can tell.

162
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,337
She looks so happy like that, doesn't she?

163
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,102
She just loves meeting new people.

164
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:03,265
So anyway. Life good with Yato?

165
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,254
Sounds about right. He's not much of a people person, huh?

166
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,879
I really want to change jobs.

167
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,011
Well, do it, then.

168
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,312
Could I work here?

169
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,987
My lady doesn't need anybody's help but mine.

170
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:17,296
Of course not!

171
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:19,533
Hey, would you like some advice, Yuki?

172
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,525
"Yuki"?

173
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,286
You should really be careful.

174
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,962
Yatty and I are close and all,

175
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,120
but I've heard some nasty rumors about him before.

176
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,419
Rumors? Like what?

177
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,475
Trust me. Despite how he might look, he's a scary god!

178
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,791
Oh, stop that. There's no need to frighten him.

179
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:44,004
Time to go! I got a call for some work! Come on, Yukine!

180
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:45,295
We're busy men!

181
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,719
Hey! Aren't you going to wait for me?

182
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,520
Thanks for having us. Sorry!

183
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,789
Aw!

184
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:54,962
Leaving already? But you just got here!

185
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,412
Yato...

186
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,975
What were you up to, bringing those two here?

187
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,118
Mom, I'm sorry.

188
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,795
I hope you'll forgive me someday.

189
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,045
Thanks for calling the Delivery God!

190
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:15,670
Yato, at your service!

191
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,920
You pushed him, Yato!

192
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:23,711
My bad!

193
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,583
Hey, I didn't jump...

194
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:30,876
I fell?

195
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,295
Incredible. Everything goes wrong for me. Even this.

196
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:35,420
No need to despair!

197
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:39,160
Hello, sir. Are you sick of the daily
grind? Depressed about your love life?

198
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:43,254
Hi there, ma'am! Having trouble
balancing your career and your family?

199
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:47,962
What's that, kids? There are some bullies in
your class that need to be taken down a notch or two?

200
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,962
Well, good news! I can solve any problem, big or small!

201
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,950
That's right, I'm fast and affordable!

202
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,879
I am the Delivery God Yato.

203
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,629
Call anytime, ladies and gen...

204
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,129
What was that for?

205
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,170
Skip the self-promotion and save him already!

206
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,374
Hand-written, huh?

207
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,837
Oh, I'm sorry. I should introduce myself, as well.

208
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,962
Here's my card. Or what used to be my card.

209
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,545
Is everyone here crazy?

210
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,879
Ah. Let me see, here.

211
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,741
So it looks like you work at an ad agency? Or did.

212
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:14,664
That's right.

213
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,670
However, the company recently went bankrupt.

214
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:20,388
That's why I'm here now. I didn't know what else to do.

215
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,024
I wanted to call my parents to apologize for doing this.

216
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:27,129
But I guess I accidentally dialed your number instead.

217
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:28,853
That explains the hang up, then.

218
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:34,337
I mean, anyway. The hand of fate is clear in
this. Start from the beginning. How did this happen?

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,129
Maybe you should start by saving him!

220
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:37,879
Well, I suppose it all began last winter.

221
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,275
You're doing this now?

222
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,577
I happened to come across a young woman.

223
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,981
I couldn't take my eyes off of her.

224
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,879
Hey, why are we using my face for this?

225
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:53,192
You just popped into my head. I
guess because you're right here. Sorry.

226
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:55,272
Stripes, huh? I wouldn't have guessed that.

227
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:56,406
Don't look!

228
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,300
Thinking she might be a runaway, I
offered to take her to find some help.

229
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,055
You must be really hungry, huh.

230
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,673
You want something to eat? We can take care of that.

231
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:12,655
No, thanks. I'm not allowed to go out to eat.

232
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,681
It's a strict rule. I'd be scared to break it.

233
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,110
Although I do sometimes sneak out
into town anyway. I can't help it.

234
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:23,126
The poor girl.

235
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:26,119
I could tell she was living
in a very controlling household.

236
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,381
She was barely even allowed outside.

237
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,985
Like a lovely bird trapped in a cage.

238
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:37,129
You could stand a change of pace.

239
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:38,581
So where would you like to go?

240
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,616
And that's it. That's how we first started dating.

241
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,885
It was the happiest time of my life.

242
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:55,012
I'm gonna vomit! This guy takes advantage of
vulnerable young women. Someone call the police!

243
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,212
It wasn't like that! I cared deeply for her!

244
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,670
I never did anything indecent, I swear on my life!

245
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,278
I don't believe you, you perv.

246
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,682
Anyway. I came to enjoy spoiling her.

247
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,047
What do you think?

248
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,569
It looks fantastic on you!

249
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:10,696
Promise?

250
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,587
You really don't mind buying all this for me?

251
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,569
Well, everything looked so good on you.

252
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,754
Of course, I'm broke until I get paid again, but oh well.

253
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,379
Thank you so much, Yusuke!

254
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:21,476
I love you!

255
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:23,379
Yep, gonna puke.

256
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,188
Stop picturing me. It's creepy!

257
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,254
How long have we been falling now?

258
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,696
Wait. This is for me?

259
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,545
Just a little present.

260
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,259
Oh, do you like Capypas?

261
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,399
They're my favorite! I've never
been to Capypa land, though.

262
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:39,462
It's called the "Kingdom of Dreams and
Hopes," so of course I'm not allowed to go.

263
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,382
What a sad life!

264
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,728
I'll take you! We'll see it together.

265
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,793
You mean it?

266
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,831
It was around then that things started to go wrong.

267
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,248
I don't know how else to explain it.

268
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,274
It's okay, boys.

269
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,661
Huh?

270
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:06,170
What's with that place? Middle-aged
men walking around wearing Capypa skins?

271
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,129
That's twisted and jus-just plain wrong!

272
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:13,129
They're just suits, it's okay! Here, you see, there's a
Capypa fairy coming along to make everything all better!

273
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,395
Enough with this stuff already!

274
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:19,383
I don't know what happened, but we
started to run into all sorts of bad luck.

275
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,095
As things got worse, my job performance steadily dropped.

276
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:29,233
I never got bonuses anymore, and my meager
savings dried up almost before I knew it.

277
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,059
But I just couldn't imagine not being with her anymore.

278
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,718
I was desperate.

279
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,170
I know you're in there!

280
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:42,180
One thing led to another and I went bankrupt.

281
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:45,472
I just wanted to be with her.

282
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,190
but with the hole I had dug for myself,
I knew I would only become a burden.

283
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,795
I wanted to spend our lives together.

284
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,808
I had been planning to propose to her.

285
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,379
Not now! I don't deserve her anymore!

286
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:58,325
Hey, uh.

287
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:00,882
You got a pic of this girl I could take a look at?

288
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:02,406
A picture?

289
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,160
There's something familiar about this story.

290
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:05,298
Here she is.

291
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,671
That's Kofuku!

292
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:10,170
Huh? How do you know her name?

293
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,379
Shoulda guessed it sooner.

294
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,670
What? Why? How could you possibly know?

295
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,587
Guess I didn't tell you everything earlier.

296
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,420
Kofuku is the god of poverty.

297
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:18,087
Huh?

298
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,178
The god of poverty?

299
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:23,706
Well, she doesn't go by her title most of the
time, and I can't say that I blame her, really.

300
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:26,277
It's not exactly the kind of thing that makes you popular.

301
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:28,504
Take my advice on this one, man.

302
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,782
Forget about that girl. Seriously. Ditch her.

303
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,809
Huh?

304
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,000
The god of poverty only brings disaster.

305
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:37,611
Spend time with her and you're
basically asking to have your life ruined.

306
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,170
Oh, and there's one more thing.

307
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:41,456
She has a guy in her life you don't want to cross.

308
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,170
And if it helps at all, she's
not nearly as young as she looks.

309
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,587
We're talkin' way older than your grandma.

310
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,629
Way older than your grandma's,
grandma's, grandma, for that matter.

311
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,689
All right, then!

312
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,629
We'll sever your ties to her and then you'll be good.

313
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:55,379
Huh?

314
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,587
Sever his ties to her? But doesn't that mean.

315
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,895
He'll forget everything having to do with Kofuku.

316
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,670
I don't want to forget her, though! No, I refuse!

317
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,795
You can't make me agree to this, can you?

318
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,746
I strongly recommend you do this.

319
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,004
If you don't, you'll die very soon.

320
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,170
Well, I'll die then! You don't understand!

321
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:13,685
I love her with my whole heart!

322
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,795
How stupid are you?

323
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:22,379
Someone who would end his own life like
this doesn't know a damn thing about love!

324
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:26,251
Think we could hurry this up, please?

325
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,015
It just keeps getting more and more insane.

326
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:28,658
All right!

327
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,277
Yukine! You're up, kid.

328
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:30,976
Huh?

329
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,285
Wait! Hold on!

330
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,254
I've never severed anyone's ties before.

331
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,698
It'll be fine, don't worry. I know you can do it.

332
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,515
Have a little faith, okay?

333
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:41,081
Come, Sekki!

334
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,899
Anything you want me to tell Kofuku?

335
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:54,422
Just this, please. "I wish you
the best. Have a happy life."

336
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,005
Very well. I've heard your wish loud and clear.

337
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:03,182
Hear me. I am the god Yato. I hereby sever ties.

338
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,467
Sekki!

339
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:07,990
Sunder!

340
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:20,976
Uh-Huh?

341
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,295
Oh, wow! Are you serious?

342
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,754
He was really going to do that just because of me?

343
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,879
I mean, it's not like I was trying to hurt him.

344
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,801
I wanted to have a little fun, that's all!

345
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:31,792
A little fun?

346
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,170
I'm hurt, Kofuku! I can't believe
you would do that behind my back!

347
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:39,698
It's your own fault, you know. I was so sick of you always
telling me where I couldn't go and what I couldn't do.

348
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,619
Well, somebody has to!

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,996
Or else you'll spread disaster everywhere!

350
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,004
I'm too old for this.

351
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:49,397
Well, anyway, you got skills, kid.

352
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,722
Severing ties while you're still a rookie!

353
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,762
Oh. I didn't realize it was a big deal.

354
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:58,512
Well, it is. Severing a bond is
much more difficult than making one.

355
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:02,401
And a Regalia's abilities play a
big part in how well it works, too.

356
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:07,004
It was so easy. I'm really surprised to hear that.

357
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,833
That's the right attitude!

358
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,045
Yato! Looks like you found yourself a good Regalia.

359
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:13,045
Yeah, I know.

360
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:15,920
When I picked him, I had a feeling
he was more than a pretty face.

361
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:17,379
Isn't that right, Yukine?

362
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:19,504
Get off 'a me! Stop, you freak!

363
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:20,962
Aw, no need to be bashful!

364
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,820
Quit it! Leave me alone, sweaty hands!

365
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:25,653
Sorry about all this.

366
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:28,105
Thanks a lot for cleaning up Kofuku's mess.

367
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:30,222
It was my pleasure!

368
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:31,837
Later!

369
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,170
Bye for now!

370
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:34,920
I hope you come back and visit, Yori!

371
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:35,512
Sure!

372
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,008
And, um, about what you said earlier.

373
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,685
Hmm?

374
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,706
When you said Yato was a scary god.

375
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:45,920
That was all just a joke, right?

376
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,530
Oh, no. It's true.

377
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:52,403
It was a long time ago, but Yatty did kill a Regalia once.

378
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,109
Before I met him, I'd only ever heard rumors.

379
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,459
And they weren't exactly very nice ones.

380
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:06,011
I mean, you gotta keep in mind Yatty is a god of war.

381
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,011
He kills people, too, sometimes.

382
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,754
He kills... people?

383
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,510
Quit it.

384
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,907
That was a long time ago.

385
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:17,920
Things were different then, you know?

386
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,005
It was basically kill or be killed.

387
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,894
Sorry, I don't understand. What are you talking about?

388
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,462
The way things work for a god.

389
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:29,327
People's wishes are what give gods the ability to exist.

390
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:33,082
Powerful gods enjoy constant worship and wishes.

391
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,510
That isn't true for the obscure gods, though.

392
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,917
They have a hard enough time even being remembered.

393
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,917
So, what do you do to keep from being forgotten?

394
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,494
You grant any wish that comes your way.

395
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,129
No matter what it is.

396
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,818
No matter who it came from.

397
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,103
Whatever it is? Really?

398
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:58,337
You were there a long time.

399
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,620
What were you chatting about?

400
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:03,188
Yato.

401
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,754
Why did you bring me to meet Kofuku?

402
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:07,093
I know you had a reason.

403
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:11,395
Listen.

404
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:13,795
If anything happens to me.

405
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:15,514
I want you to go straight to those two.

406
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:17,800
Do you understand?

407
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,587
Yeah. Got it!

408
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,045
Oh, wow.

409
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,006
Why does he smell so nice?

410
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:34,117
When I picked him, I had a feeling
he was more than a pretty face.

411
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:43,196
Hi.

412
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:46,587
You know, you have really pretty eyes.

413
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:53,087
That's enough, Nora.

414
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,024
What do you want?

415
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:58,581
For starters, you could call me by my name.

416
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:02,053
Please, Yato.

417
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:05,252
It isn't so much to ask, is it? I love that name.

418
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,577
Wait, is this girl...

419
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,235
Is she a Regalia of yours, too?

420
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,204
Remember, whenever you need me, I'll be waiting.

421
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,171
Just waiting for you to call my name.

422
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,426
That's all you have to do.

423
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:00,462
Say "Yato" ten times, really fast.

424
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,795
Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato, Yato!

425
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,254
Now, who's the coolest guy ever?

426
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:06,420
Daikoku!

427
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,087
Who's the best god in the world?

428
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:07,920
Kofuku!

429
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:08,714
Tch!

430
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:11,629
Next time on Noragami: "Borderline."
