1
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,531
My shrine has grown so neglected.

2
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:16,762
The world was once ruled by strife
and filled with countless vile wishes.

3
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:21,884
But the etchings here are those that have been
long since fulfilled, and callers come no more.

4
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:23,122
Rabo.

5
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:27,019
And yet... here I stand. Still alive, after all this time.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,542
We two are gods of calamity.

7
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:35,498
Where we are born from chaos and
suffering, only to be reclaimed by it.

8
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,315
Isn't that so, Yato god?

9
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,226
Huh?

10
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:55,907
What?

11
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:59,452
You. Why did you come along with us, you idiot?

12
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:07,412
Huh? Where are we? How did we get here? And
why do I have a tail? What's going on here?

13
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:09,293
Oh, man.

14
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:10,786
I'm pleased you've come.

15
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,109
Rabo.

16
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,845
They seem to have brought one uninvited guest.

17
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:25,053
I swear... You are nothing but a nuisance.

18
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:25,845
Hiyori!

19
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,538
Huh?

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,164
You need to get far away from here!

21
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:32,954
Well, here we are.

22
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,919
Come at me!

23
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:35,889
Sekki!

24
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:37,984
Reiki!

25
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:25,512
I will make you return... Hiyori's memories!

26
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,202
We've got him!

27
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,392
You're too slow!

28
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:01,340
Dammit! I can't break it from the inside!

29
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,024
Furuhime.

30
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:09,488
The true Yato god has yet to return to us.

31
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,119
Hiyori?

32
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,463
Ow, that hurt.

33
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,847
Hey, are you okay?

34
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:38,074
Uh-huh. But what the hell are you
doing here? Didn't I tell you to run?

35
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,690
Still. I appreciate it.

36
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,812
Sure.

37
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:54,865
What is that look on his face?

38
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,987
That thawed, soft expression.

39
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:08,188
Where is he?

40
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,150
Huh?

41
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,495
The god of calamity I knew!

42
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:21,513
Where is the true Yato?

43
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:22,819
Tell me!

44
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:35,840
With those eyes aflame with beautiful
depravity. Where is that Yato god?

45
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:39,345
That's the god of calamity
worthy of crossing swords with me!

46
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,494
Shut your mouth!

47
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,830
Now I see.

48
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,607
You don't have the right motivation.

49
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,322
I told you to shut up!

50
00:05:58,996 --> 00:05:59,954
What are you...?

51
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:21,491
Sekki!

52
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:29,873
Well Rabo?

53
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:37,695
I've never seen a Storm this
massive. This does not bode well.

54
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,100
There's no end to them. They just keep coming!

55
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:54,211
Kazuma.

56
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:55,398
Yes?

57
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,031
What did Lady Kofuku tell you?

58
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,834
I've got a feeling that a Vent didn't cause this Storm.

59
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,295
You're right, Veena.

60
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:07,312
A Storm like this. It is the product of a god of calamity.

61
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,424
A god of calamity?

62
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,082
Yukine!

63
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,077
What are we gonna do here, Yato?

64
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,720
I want you to take Hiyori and get away from here.

65
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:30,398
Huh?

66
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,625
I'm the only one that Rabo's concerned with.
I'll keep him busy while you two get out of here.

67
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:39,445
What, you can't be serious?
You're completely unarmed without me!

68
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:39,987
Shut up!

69
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,422
I can handle this.

70
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:55,638
What is that?

71
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,678
It's the container holding Hiyori's memories.

72
00:07:58,762 --> 00:07:59,091
Huh?

73
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,845
Oh, how tragic.

74
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:25,089
The mortal life is just too fragile.

75
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:28,595
Hiyori!

76
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:32,097
Hiyori!

77
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,297
Please! Wake up!

78
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,822
Hiyori!

79
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,042
Hiyori!

80
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:44,177
Yato! There's something wrong
with her! Hiyori... What do we do?

81
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,821
Forget the girl, Yato god.

82
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:59,687
She's been reduced to nothing more than a mindless,
hollow container now. Just an empty sack of flesh.

83
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:19,810
Rabo.

84
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,104
Have I awakened your hatred?

85
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:26,713
Finally.

86
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:36,353
Show me your loathing, fierce deity. Accept and
embrace your maelstrom of hate. God of calamity, Yato!

87
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:37,612
Be quiet.

88
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,787
Sekki!

89
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:11,762
There they are. Those are the eyes.

90
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,815
Come!

91
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,127
You come to me this time.

92
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:21,780
That grin on your face? I'm gonna carve it into a frown.

93
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:24,561
Yato?

94
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:07,724
This takes me back.

95
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,809
The sky is roiling above us just as when we lived.

96
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,154
We are gods of calamity.

97
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:41,264
Fierce deities devoted to heinous wishes and
driven to soak the Near Shore in the blood of innocence.

98
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,389
Enough talk.

99
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,589
This is it.
The moment I've been waiting for.

100
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,165
The moment that my very own wish comes to pass!

101
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,188
My earthly name is Rabo.

102
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,940
Bearing a posthumous name, I don this mask.

103
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,220
And proclaim myself a spirit vessel!

104
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,437
Ye names that assemble cannot defy me.

105
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:08,986
You are bound and beholden to my every order!

106
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:12,045
Submit yourselves to me! And obey the mask!

107
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,701
Now gather depravity!

108
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,767
The Storm.

109
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:25,383
He's absorbing it!

110
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:39,061
You damn fool. Are you completely
insane? Merging your being with Phantoms?

111
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:46,402
Insane? Of course not. I've taken this
action... In order to fight you to the death!

112
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,010
Yato! Look! Hiyori!

113
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:50,365
What's happened to me?

114
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:52,432
Where am I?

115
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,335
Who am I?

116
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,273
Who am I?

117
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,512
I don't know.

118
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,706
I don't know anything.

119
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:03,981
This smell.

120
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,093
It seems so familiar.

121
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:13,007
Yato! You okay? Yato!

122
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:22,497
Rabo. He's coming for us! Yato! Wake up! Yato!

123
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,929
It smells so nice.

124
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,285
I know I've smelled it somewhere before.

125
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,015
I know it because...

126
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,914
...it's my favorite smell.

127
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:55,706
Hey why are you crying?

128
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,063
Yato.

129
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,832
You... You know me.

130
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,081
Hiyori!

131
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,409
Hiyori!

132
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,888
Huh?

133
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,492
You're okay! You're back! Ha! Hiyori!

134
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,053
Thank you!

135
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:19,661
Wh-wh-wh-wha?

136
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:25,702
Get off of me you creepy deadbeat!

137
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,543
She broke my spell completely on her own.

138
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,322
She shouldn't have been able to uncork her memories

139
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,392
How did she?

140
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,705
You cretin! I expected more from you!

141
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:45,808
Hiyori.

142
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,007
You called me... by my name.

143
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:50,325
So?

144
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:54,095
Her memory's back! She knows us!

145
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:57,310
Well yeah. Why wouldn't I know you guys?

146
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,331
Hiyori!

147
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:12,737
What will it take to make you return to your old self?

148
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:18,637
We are gods of calamity! We grant depraved
wishes and feed upon human greed and hate...

149
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,066
So what? Quit bringin' up the
past! It doesn't mean anything now!

150
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,711
Let Hiyori go!

151
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,820
It's all your fault.

152
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,119
You're to blame for his pathetic state!

153
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,549
A pitiful half-Phantom.

154
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,856
You will serve as a sacrifice for my power!

155
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,195
Sekki!

156
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,678
We're taking him out.

157
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:47,293
Huh?

158
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,178
We'll hit Hiyori from this distance-

159
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:50,901
It's just like a Borderline.

160
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:54,873
Rabo's absorbed a Storm and
merged with the Phantoms within.

161
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:59,012
It's up to you to draw the line
between who gets killed and who survives.

162
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,267
What? It's up to me?

163
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,990
You can do this, Yukine.

164
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,363
We can do this. Together!

165
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,803
This is the land of the rising sun.

166
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,078
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

167
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,845
Hear me. I am the god Yato.

168
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:25,970
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki

169
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:28,609
and expel thy vast defilement!

170
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,817
I cleanse thee!

171
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,057
Rend!

172
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:07,783
Yato!

173
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:08,635
Hiyori!

174
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,904
You alright?

175
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,285
Let's go home.

176
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:20,972
Let's go home. Please take me home.

177
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:22,468
Yato!

178
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,494
Yato.

179
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,668
You have made a wish.

180
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,177
Ya-Yato.

181
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,342
And it's been heard loud and clear.

182
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,313
Yato god!

183
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,137
Yato god.

184
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,978
His face!

185
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:56,414
Just as I thought.

186
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,831
You used a curse to maintain your disintegrating form.

187
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:01,610
But why?

188
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:05,837
It doesn't matter how many wishes we grant them.

189
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:12,210
People always loathe gods of calamity,
and ultimately, they forget about us.

190
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:17,352
For better or worse, humans
will always be fickle creatures.

191
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,332
That is the way of things.

192
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:23,737
It is our inescapable fate to be slain by their disregard.

193
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:30,633
And so, when I awoke from my 500
year slumber... I yearned to be killed.

194
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,303
Not by the ignorance of man, but by the
hand of one who does truly know me...by you.

195
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,176
You've always been such a downer.

196
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:49,148
And now, Yato god... I go first. First into the
depths of fate that you and I are bound to share.

197
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,246
Except that I'm nothing like you.

198
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,165
A god has been slain.

199
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,387
Another god lost.

200
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,319
Well, that was a massive failure.

201
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,511
I guess I'd better go home and speak with Father.

202
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,137
So you remember everything? You remember me and Yato?

203
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,074
Yep!

204
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:35,262
I've gotta ask though. How did you
just suddenly get your memory back?

205
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:35,703
Huh?

206
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:40,181
It was because of Yato's... his smell.

207
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,223
His what?

208
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:48,150
Uh. Never mind, forget it, it's nothing!
Yeah, I don't know how! I can't remember at all!

209
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,910
Okay.

210
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:52,875
What's up?

211
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,053
Hiyori.

212
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,060
Okay, you're all serious now.

213
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:01,660
Just listen.

214
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,775
I think it's for the best if you cut all ties with us.

215
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:11,985
That's the only way you'll really live a happy life.

216
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:12,993
So.

217
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,970
What? Hey, hold on!

218
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:15,890
No, I'm not gonna do that.

219
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:22,087
We're friends. There's no way I'd
be happy without you guys in my life.

220
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:33,803
Wow! Yatty and Yukki really mean that
much to you? Are you sure about that?

221
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,586
She's just being stubborn for the sake of being stubborn.

222
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:42,597
That is not true. I mean it. I'm not turning
my back on you. I wanna be with you forever.

223
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:47,470
You're the only one who wants to cut ties here, Yato.

224
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,976
How romantic!

225
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,315
We need booze!

226
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,720
It's time to celebrate!

227
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:58,081
Uh, wait! I didn't mean I wanna be with
you forever like that, not in that way!

228
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,966
I'll grant your wish... for five yen.

229
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:06,612
Pay up!

230
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:18,499
You've made a wish and it's been heard, loud and clear.

231
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:23,256
Hiyori Iki. May our fates forever intertwine.
