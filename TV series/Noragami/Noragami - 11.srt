1
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:48,311
Rabo.

2
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,992
Reiki.

3
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,452
What the hell is going on here?

4
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,614
Sounds like Yatty and Yukki
have finally made their way home.

5
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:43,952
Yeah, when exactly did those
two become a part of our household?

6
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,195
This doesn't make sense, what's happening?

7
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,335
Think you could try to calm down? Seriously.

8
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,688
Calm down? But what's wrong with Hiyori?

9
00:02:50,794 --> 00:02:52,203
Uh, Yukine.

10
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,856
This guy you're with...

11
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,485
Who is he?

12
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:58,521
What do you mean?

13
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,305
Nice one, Hiyori, now quit jokin'
around. C'mon, it's me, ya dummy!

14
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:06,468
Meyadummy... That's your name?

15
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,294
Yeah! Mister Meyadummy! That's'a me!

16
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:12,019
Well that was a stupid accent!

17
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:19,002
So, Yukine? He's a friend of
yours? Is he a comedian or something?

18
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,734
Huh?

19
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,732
It's gotta be some form of amnesia.

20
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,208
It must be!

21
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:29,252
The really weird thing about it is that the
only thing she seems to have forgotten is you.

22
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:30,960
What do we do?

23
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:36,745
For starters, quit freaking out. I bet it's just a
temporary condition. I'm sure she'll remember you soon.

24
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,149
No.

25
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:40,133
No what?

26
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,840
I will make Hiyori normal again.

27
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,409
That's it!

28
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:53,343
Follow me this way!

29
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:57,318
I was actually just dropping by to give
you these old reference books to study.

30
00:03:57,343 --> 00:03:59,491
I know, but just humor him, will ya?

31
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:05,442
If I can direct your attention to the
left. This street! This famous street.

32
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:09,509
This is the very location where the god
Yato met a certain girl while rescuing Milord!

33
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:10,146
Huh?

34
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:17,051
A lord used to live around here? That's cool. I
had no idea there was so much history to this street.

35
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,151
I don't think that's jogging her memory.

36
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,995
Do you know his name, Mr. Yato? The lord.

37
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:30,652
"Mr. Yato"? It's Yato! There's
no "mister"! You only call me Yato!

38
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,805
Okay. It just seems kind of
rude to call you that right away.

39
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,100
I'll show you, Hiyori!

40
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,293
Hey! Quit drawing in my books!

41
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:44,506
This is Milord! He's a cat!

42
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,366
Oh, wow.

43
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:50,500
That's great! You're talented, Mr. Yato.

44
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:53,563
I'm trying to show you the drawing, not my artistry!

45
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:54,996
Oh, that's right.

46
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,754
Milord was the name of the cat that you drew.

47
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,675
You remember the cat? So, do you remember me then?

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,990
Let me think.

49
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,963
You're a manga artist?

50
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:09,709
I'm sorry, but I really need to get going.

51
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:14,390
Do you mind if we do your lessons another time, Yukine?

52
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,114
I've put your homework assignments
in here until we can meet.

53
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,286
Sure. Thanks.

54
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,326
See ya.

55
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:22,673
Wait!

56
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,119
Please, Hiyori.

57
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,816
Do you really not remember me?

58
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:35,194
Just try to think. Is there nothing there?

59
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,610
In that case...

60
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,794
Let's get into bed together. That just might
help you remember when we met at the hospital...

61
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,820
Pervert!

62
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,721
Yatty and Yukki wanted us
to put some dinner aside for them to eat later.

63
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:01,168
Right. Meals are the one thing they never seem to miss.

64
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,886
A picture book of her memories?

65
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:06,705
After everything else, you really think that's gonna work?

66
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:12,671
Yes! It will! You saw how she reacted earlier! The
drawing of Milord clearly woke something inside her!

67
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,667
Now quit naysaying and help me here!

68
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:19,122
Whatever. You can make your own coloring book.

69
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:35,433
It's weird. That guy seemed so desperate.
I wonder why it's so important to him.

70
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:52,249
Alright! I've got all the tools for a
vivid picture book! It won't be long now!

71
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:56,257
Man, I can't believe you threw away what
little money you had on some stupid art supplies.

72
00:06:56,288 --> 00:06:58,663
Anything for the sake of Hiyori!

73
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,614
Now that I think about it. Maybe
something specific caused this.

74
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,382
Yato?

75
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:10,781
What's wrong?

76
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,243
I should have known you were somehow behind this. Nora.

77
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:26,183
Behind what, Yato? Erasing Hiyori's memories of you?

78
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:34,338
It was actually rather easy. There's no reason for her to
retain memories of Far Shore denizens in her simple mind.

79
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,104
It seems that people are
quick to forget that they've ever met you.

80
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,403
Wouldn't you agree?

81
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:47,097
No matter how much you grant humans' wishes,
their behavior is always so fickle and erratic.

82
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:50,938
Poor Yato, don't you ever get tired of being hurt so much?

83
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:56,899
Why keep putting yourself through it? Wouldn't
it be easier to simply embrace your true self?

84
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:02,422
Yato! Snap out of it! Don't let her mess with your head!

85
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,086
You're right.

86
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,188
Fine, Nora, just what the hell are you scheming this time?

87
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:17,488
I only wanted to get your attention to
make sure that you haven't forgotten us, Yato.

88
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,316
Reiki.

89
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:29,057
You... It can't be... Rabo!

90
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,068
How are you alive?

91
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:35,716
It's been a long time, Yato god.

92
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:37,160
Who is he?

93
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,986
That's a cute sun visor you're wearing.

94
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,663
Let's begin.

95
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,950
Come. Sekki!

96
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:10,070
Whoa! You actually wanna kill this guy?

97
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:14,615
If I hold back even a little bit he'll kill me right away.

98
00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,400
Damn! He's as fast as always!

99
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:05,855
Yato god.

100
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,307
What has become of you?

101
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,997
This is not the power of the god I once knew.

102
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,414
You must remember.

103
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:16,816
You must remember.

104
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,348
You must remember...

105
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,806
You must remember!

106
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:26,680
Yato!

107
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,306
Yato, are you okay?

108
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,542
Yato!

109
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,760
As for the next report...

110
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:45,289
What is this?

111
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,052
What's happening?

112
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:04,946
Yato.

113
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:07,527
Yukine!

114
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:15,612
There's no doubt. The Yato god
I knew is a thing of the past.

115
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:16,888
Furuhime.

116
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,125
I know, but now you see.

117
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,768
Listen, Yato.

118
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:32,312
I'd like to see you defeat Rabo. If you
do. I'll return Hiyori Iki's memory to her.

119
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,245
And that's a promise.

120
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,840
So, as far as this sudden storm goes? Nope.

121
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,031
I'm afraid my lady's got nothin' to do with it.

122
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:57,625
You're the first god I come to when a Vent randomly opens.

123
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,523
I never would've thought Yato was involved.

124
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:05,764
It was brutal. We couldn't even come
close to taking down this Rabo guy.

125
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,932
Rabo, huh?

126
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,009
I've never heard of the dude.

127
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,636
A god of calamity.

128
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:18,248
Nobody has spoken his name in ages now.
But he was apparently well-known long ago.

129
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:20,481
Then you know him, master?

130
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:26,473
Rabo was in fact originally human. As I
recall, in his life, he served as a Herald.

131
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:27,894
What's a Herald?

132
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:32,677
A minion who sneaks into enemy land.
A thug who carries out dirty work.

133
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:37,869
Once a Herald finishes his work, his
master kills him to ensure his silence.

134
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,200
Seriously?

135
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,317
Apparently. He was deified after he was
murdered, and turned into a god of calamity.

136
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,836
Wait, what's a god of calamity?

137
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,856
People don't always ask the gods
for good things. There are bad wishes.

138
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,075
Really? Like what?

139
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:59,028
The destruction of someone you hate, for example.

140
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:04,750
A god of calamity hears these
wicked requests, and fulfills them.

141
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:09,941
Rabo favored senseless murder as his
particular method in granting these wishes.

142
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:15,109
There's no discernment to his actions.
He kills Phantoms. He kills humans.

143
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:19,040
And he's even been known to kill gods.
On request.

144
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:20,869
Wha...?

145
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,661
What does someone like that want with Hiyori?

146
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,809
I'm guessing he's an old pal of Yato's?

147
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,976
I have heard certain rumors.

148
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:35,277
Yato did allegedly partner with a god of calamity.

149
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,402
Rabo hasn't changed at all. He's just as powerful.

150
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,823
If I'm not careful, he might kill Yukine.

151
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,210
How is he? Shouldn't simply existing be
a struggle for a god of calamity like him?

152
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:54,440
What? Hold on a minute! You're telling
me that those two worked together?

153
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,577
Does that mean...? Is Yato a god of calamity too?

154
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,453
I didn't even know...

155
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,042
Yori knows something about it.

156
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,347
I mentioned it to her once before.

157
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:10,442
That's right. And she didn't seem
to have any problems with it, either.

158
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,120
That girl. She's one tough cookie, ya know?

159
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:16,200
Yatty's different than he used to be.

160
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:18,647
Which is why Yori's stuck by his side.

161
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:23,684
I think it's pretty obvious at this point
that Yori really loves you and Yatty.

162
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:31,186
I... I have to get her memories back for her.

163
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,807
She'll never remember me. Not at this rate.

164
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:37,590
Perhaps it's for the best if she doesn't.

165
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:41,496
As I've said before, you should cut your ties with her.

166
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:46,741
Your connection gives her too much of a
direct focus on the events of our world.

167
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,426
It will eventually keep her from living in her own.

168
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,709
Forgetting you could be the best thing to happen to her.

169
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:56,579
She'll likely revert back to her fully human state.

170
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:59,563
And she'll never be happy as a half-Phantom.

171
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,187
He appears to have made up his mind.

172
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,759
Poor Yato.

173
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:12,470
Yato! Where have you been all night?

174
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,809
Listen to this. I was thinking about Hiyori's mem...

175
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,428
Forget it.

176
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,659
Just forget about Hiyori.

177
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:23,917
What? Hey! Yato! Yato!

178
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,216
We must act quickly.

179
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:38,903
The longer we wait, the more
remorseless the passage of time becomes.

180
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,903
You worry too much.

181
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:44,263
Yato will return very soon.

182
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:45,865
I'm sure of it.

183
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,791
And then!

184
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,144
Yukki! Have you seen Yatty yet?

185
00:15:58,686 --> 00:15:59,524
What the hell?

186
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,511
What's wrong with Yato now?

187
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,025
This doesn't make sense.

188
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:04,309
Why now?

189
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:17,818
I drew this.

190
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:19,392
But how?

191
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:22,438
The only way I could have is if I do know him.

192
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:26,782
But if I do, why can't I remember him?

193
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,498
It's Yukine.

194
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:37,725
Hiyori!

195
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,304
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

196
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,093
No big. So what's up?

197
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,014
For you.

198
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,762
Wow, a picture book!

199
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,542
So did you make it?

200
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:56,799
Can I read it to you?

201
00:16:57,782 --> 00:16:58,485
Uh-huh.

202
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,822
Here we go.

203
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:05,616
This is the story of Yato,

204
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,048
the tracksuit-wearing god and his friend Hiyori.

205
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:09,651
Now let the tale begin!

206
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:16,306
Dammit, Yukine. He's with Hiyori again.

207
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:23,002
And on his very first try, the
gifted Regalia drew a Borderline.

208
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:26,131
That's so cool! You really are amazing, Yukine.

209
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:28,813
Even Yato was surprised when I did it.

210
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,900
Really? He was?

211
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,013
Uh, yeah. Moving on.

212
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,115
Yato.

213
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,145
Do you recognize this?

214
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,955
So the ablution was a success.
All thanks to Yato and Hiyori.

215
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:07,174
If neither of you had been there for me.
Then I might not have been able to come back.

216
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:11,737
And that's how...

217
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,131
That's how...

218
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:27,118
And that's how Hiyori, Yato, and
I... ...all became best friends.

219
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:41,053
I'm sorry, but I still don't have
any memories of Mr. Yato.

220
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,282
Although, it does sound like we really are good friends.

221
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:47,530
Yeah!

222
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,354
So, I was wondering.

223
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,184
If you don't mind and all, could I have that book?

224
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,335
Huh? Uh, y'see, the thing...

225
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,688
I just kind of feel like if I keep looking at it over
and over, it might help me remember what I've forgotten.

226
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:03,029
If you think so.

227
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,062
The lunar cycle is waning.

228
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:14,077
Tell me, Yato. Where do you suppose
the waning part of the moon goes?

229
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,353
Where does it go?

230
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,059
You okay?

231
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,278
Hiyori...

232
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,556
Um. Is this yours?

233
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:44,818
Yukine.

234
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,335
What the hell have you done, Nora?

235
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:53,652
Hiyori's memory is waning bit by
bit, falling away into total darkness.

236
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:59,868
If you don't come see us, and soon,
she'll end up as nothing but an empty vessel.

237
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:11,733
Hiyori.

238
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,286
She's forgotten about me now.

239
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,790
She doesn't remember me!

240
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,699
Yukine.

241
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:26,377
We're going to get her memory back. It's just...

242
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:29,990
Going up against them again could very likely destroy you.

243
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,343
Yato.

244
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:36,882
Not only that, but I might
give them exactly what they want.

245
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,108
You have to believe in yourself.

246
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,425
That is what you told me, right?

247
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:57,250
Is that supposed to be me?

248
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,790
Why do I have a tail?

249
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:02,176
Hiyori! Time to go!

250
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,511
Hiyori!

251
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,188
Uh, yeah?

252
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:18,963
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
freaked out on you like that earlier.

253
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,497
Really. You're the one who's
being tormented through all this.

254
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:26,377
The thing is. We've dragged you into something terrible.

255
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,963
Actually. It's Yato's crappy history that's to blame here.

256
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:35,424
But, he is still my master, and his
problems are, well they're my problems, too.

257
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:37,989
Do I have to do all the talking?

258
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,769
I promise that we will get your memory back,

259
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:45,430
so you just rest easy and wait. Okay?

260
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,298
Hiyori? What's wrong?

261
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,407
I'm actually not sure. I don't know why I'm crying.

262
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,119
Enough of that.

263
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,111
Let's go.

264
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,585
Dun-duh-dun! It's time for your Regalia
midterms! List ten good things about me!

265
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:03,074
Ten?

266
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,752
You're already failing! Try for five.

267
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:05,391
Five?

268
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:07,419
Next time on Noragami: "A Scrap of a Memory."

269
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:08,770
Fine, just the best three!

270
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,519
I'm sorry, but I can't think of any.

271
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:11,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you serious?
