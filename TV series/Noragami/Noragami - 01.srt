1
00:00:00,873 --> 00:00:02,626
Man, tests really suck.

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:06,539
I have to ace this.

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:10,052
I just want to get out of this place.
Should've studied harder!

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,766
Look at her. Does she think she's too cool for us?

5
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,115
I just need to pass.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,101
You're a loser. Nobody cares about you.

7
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:19,698
I failed, I know I failed.

8
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,378
She misses a little bit of school, and now
she's getting all this special treatment? Please!

9
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:25,537
Pathetic.

10
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:29,078
Why does she even bother living?
She's just a waste of space.

11
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,450
You really do suck.

12
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:38,892
Help me!

13
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,368
Oh, god, please help me!

14
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:45,148
Payment received.

15
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,831
You have made a wish, and it's been heard, loud and clear!

16
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:53,472
Uh, does this phantom seem especially large to you?

17
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:56,069
It is exam season. Everyone's on edge.

18
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:00,221
But with you I can take this thing easily.
Ready to go, Tomone?

19
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:01,832
I'm ready when you are.

20
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,181
Alright then, let's do it!

21
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,385
Hey there, fish face, how you doing?

22
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:30,446
This is the land of the rising sun.
Your desecration shall not be allowed.

23
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:35,297
I now lay thee waste with the Hanki,
and expel thy vast defilement!

24
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:35,986
Rend!

25
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:47,857
Bye now!

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,251
That the best you can do? Didn't even break a sweat.

27
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:02,338
Hey, Yato, aren't you forgetting something?

28
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:03,886
Oh!

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,973
Revert, Tomone.

30
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,571
Ugh. Didn't break a sweat, huh?

31
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,661
Show some respect, huh? I'm your master!

32
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:20,710
Actually, we need to talk about that.

33
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:23,993
I'm quitting. I won't be your regalia anymore.

34
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:26,986
Uh, you're just kidding, right?
It's only been like three months...

35
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,875
It felt like three years! I can't take it anymore!

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,375
Living like a vagrant with a minor god who
doesn't even have his own shrine! I can't do it!

37
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,089
No!

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,343
Huh?

39
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:44,001
Hey, shouldn't I be the one who's crying here?

40
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:48,966
Fine! Stop wailing already! I can take a hint.

41
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:51,879
It's over. I hereby release you.

42
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,193
That's so much better!

43
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:01,241
And just so you know, the usual practice is to
give at least a full month's notice before you quit.

44
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,576
It's common courtesy.

45
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:04,774
As if you deserve any courtesy.

46
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:05,822
Later, loser!

47
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,716
You're just an aimless drifter in a tracksuit
who likes to play at being a god.

48
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:13,488
Damn you!
Don't you dare come crawling back once I hit it big!

49
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:19,542
Just you wait and see! Soon enough I'll have 120
million worshippers, and all the other gods will envy me!

50
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:21,438
You ungrateful wretch!

51
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,036
A-choo!

52
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,370
That fickle wench.

53
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,317
I can't believe a regalia actually quit on me.

54
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:07,115
Ow, my neck. This is gettin' old.

55
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:12,581
Pretty meager savings. I'll never have a shrine, will I?

56
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,470
Oh, well.

57
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:18,189
Finding a new regalia comes first.
God or not, without a regalia I'm unarmed.

58
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:23,522
No, worse than that, I'm essentially naked!
I can't go out on any jobs like this!

59
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,434
Of course, it's not like I've got a ton of work, anyway.

60
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,018
Hello there, and thank you for calling!
Fast and affordable, delivery god Yato at your service!

61
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:39,875
Huh?

62
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,938
Milord has gone missing? That's awful!

63
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:53,074
Milord, huh? That's quite a name. Some
people are really weird about their pets.

64
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,185
I guess "Milord" is better than "my god," right?

65
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,033
Cute cat, though.

66
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,638
Ami here's no better than these people.
She named her dog after Zenny's leader.

67
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:04,587
What's so bad about that?
Shiina's totally the love of my life!

68
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:07,443
Yeah, whatever. I'm all about the hundred archfiends.

69
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,348
I don't understand how you can like that stuff.

70
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,689
Milord! Where are you?

71
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,045
Here, kitty!

72
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,919
Come to Yato!

73
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:19,586
Well, which do you think is more godlike, Hiyori?

74
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,139
Want to see the man I worship?

75
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,940
We've entered the final round
of the showdown of the century, folks!

76
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,895
The fighters are circling and... look at that!
He goes for the leg! How will Tono respond?

77
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,537
There it is!

78
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:44,244
His patented Jungle Savate technique!

79
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,372
Sorry. Obviously you were the
wrong person to ask about this.

80
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:50,275
I didn't know you liked martial arts.
Are you a closet fan?

81
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,481
Well, I wouldn't say I'm a closet fan, exactly.

82
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,475
You haven't told your parents, right?

83
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,665
Uh, no. I'm fairly certain my mom's head would
explode if she found out I'm into this stuff.

84
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,672
Here, Milord! Where are you?

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,956
Are you back there? Milord!
Where be'est thou? Here, kitty, kitty!

86
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:10,004
Okay, stop it! That's plain freaky!

87
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,644
You two sound just like her!

88
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:16,915
Anyway, Hiyori, are there any guys you do like?
Besides Tono, of course.

89
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:20,835
Yeah! Like someone closer to
our age who isn't a famous fighter.

90
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:25,605
Huh? Well, um... someone I like... let's see...

91
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,880
No, I don't think there is anybody.

92
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,679
There you are!

93
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:53,803
Hey, no! Come back! Don't you run off! Milord! Wait!

94
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,279
Beeeeeep!

95
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,982
Hiyori?

96
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,879
Hey! What happened? A girl jumped in front of that bus!

97
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:21,813
Running into the street like that? What kind of an
idiot are you? You realize you could've been killed?

98
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,615
Well hey, uh... Aren't you missing something?

99
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:30,016
Hiyori? Hiyori? Can you hear me? Hiyori! Say something!

100
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,597
Is she still breathing?

101
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,208
I called for an ambulance.

102
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:34,026
Huh?

103
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,430
Huh?!

104
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:36,814
Huh?

105
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,528
Huh?!

106
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,978
Hiyori?

107
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,561
Please be okay!

108
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:45,989
Hiyori!

109
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,261
Her eyes are opening!

110
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,570
Thank goodness you're awake! We were so worried!

111
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,403
How do you feel? Are you in pain?

112
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,662
Don't just stand there, dear, examine her!

113
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:57,739
Oh, of course!

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,892
Good, everything looks normal.

115
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,598
Unbelievable!

116
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,256
So I'm okay, dad?

117
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:13,359
Well, your cat scan looked just fine,
and your eeg appears normal, too.

118
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:17,473
Considering you were hit by a bus,
it's a miracle you only wound up with a few scratches.

119
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:18,766
A bus hit me?

120
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,866
Whatever the tests say, I'm still worried.
If anything should happen to our precious Hiyori.

121
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,192
We should keep her here for observation.
It is our hospital.

122
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:30,909
Come, now, dear.
There's a list of patients waiting to be admitted.

123
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,408
Even so.

124
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,126
What about the other guy? What happened to him?

125
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,977
Yeah another person. I think I saw someone.

126
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:44,760
What? Nobody else was there, though.
Hiyori was just suddenly lying in the street.

127
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,167
Are you sure?

128
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,522
You've been through a trauma.
Maybe your memory's still a bit hazy.

129
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,860
I'm sure there was somebody there!

130
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:59,685
Oh, my poor dear. You must be
exhausted. Why don't you get some rest?

131
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:05,866
He was there. He was. I'm sure of it, and there's more.

132
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,762
I remember. Another me, like I was outside my body.

133
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:31,748
I don't want to die.

134
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:32,445
It's not fair!

135
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,918
Where is she?

136
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,564
Please let me see him!

137
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,717
When will I get to leave? I hate it here!

138
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:38,348
I'm really scared... mommy!

139
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:47,811
It hurts. It hurts so much!
Please just make it stop hurting!

140
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:50,220
We can leave when you're all better, okay?

141
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:52,831
These voices. What are they?

142
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,670
I can't breathe!

143
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,320
It hurts, mommy!

144
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,303
I just want to go outside for a little bit.

145
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,733
It's hopeless.

146
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,247
You hear the voices of the far shore?

147
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,217
Doesn't look like you got hurt too bad, huh?

148
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,006
The guy from earlier!

149
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,643
Thanks for that, by the way.

150
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:35,140
'Course, I didn't need help avoiding that bus,
but no human has ever tried to save me before.

151
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,172
I don't get it. Who are you?

152
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,340
That's easy. I'm a god.

153
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,243
Hello, police? There's an intruder in my hospital
room. I think he might be crazy. He says he's a god...

154
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:51,158
Wait, hang up the phone! I'm not crazy.
I really am one of the gods, okay?

155
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,475
I am the god Yato.

156
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,336
A god called Yato?

157
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:01,302
What are you playing at? I've never
heard of that god. Not once in my whole life!

158
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,650
Well, that's understandable.
I'm still what you might call an up-and-comer.

159
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:11,476
But just wait!
Before much longer, the whole world will know my name!

160
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:18,282
I'll be mega famous. The go-to
god! The god that everybody prays to!

161
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,084
Awesome, aren't I?

162
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:25,564
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

163
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,510
I'll be the highest god in the land! Me! Yato!

164
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,276
It's gonna be real stormy tonight.

165
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:47,813
This place is already crawling with 'em,
and I'm regalia-less, so I can't stick around.

166
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:50,669
Somebody else is already using Nora tonight.

167
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,661
Hey! That's one of my get-well gifts!

168
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:53,836
By the way, what's your name?

169
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,952
Uh, it's Hiyori. Hiyori Iki.

170
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:00,712
Hiyori Iki, huh?

171
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:06,624
I came to make sure you're okay, and you
seem to be just fine. So, we're even now.

172
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,091
Huh?

173
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:09,440
See ya!

174
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:11,869
Wait!

175
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:23,897
My body feels so heavy... Can't stay awake... Yato...

176
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:30,688
Hiyori!

177
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:32,976
Ami! Yama! Hey, you guys!

178
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,627
So, you're all healed up, then?

179
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:35,111
Yep!

180
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,689
You scared us! Glad you didn't die or anything.

181
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:39,619
I'll try never to do it again, I swear.

182
00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:43,884
Yeah, stay away from buses from now on.
Or you'll see my version of a jungle Savate!

183
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,659
I bet she wouldn't mind a good smack from her dear Tono!

184
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,032
You're probably right!

185
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,881
Whoa, hey, easy there!

186
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:55,200
Whoops. I'm sorry. I've just started
getting these sudden attacks of drowsiness.

187
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:55,693
Huh?

188
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,019
Don't stay up so late playing video games.

189
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,905
I don't know, maybe it was just a dream.

190
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,875
It felt so real, that night in the hospital.
I could have sworn I met somebody.

191
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:21,023
Tracksuits...

192
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,309
You sure you're okay, Hiyori?

193
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:26,130
Yeah, what's going on?
You've been kinda out of it all day.

194
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:29,146
Sorry, like I said before, I'm just sleepy.

195
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:33,153
Maybe you should still be in the hospital.
It hasn't been long since the accident.

196
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,248
What is it? Why'd you stop?

197
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,893
Hmm? Oh, that cat again?

198
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:47,696
That's right.

199
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:53,563
That day, there was some strange guy
in a tracksuit chasing a cat.

200
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,784
Milord, where are you?

201
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,267
I'm sorry, you guys. Go on without me.

202
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:01,657
Huh?

203
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:02,022
Huh?

204
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:03,375
I shall stay.

205
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,224
I must endeavor to locate Milord forthwith.

206
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,567
What?

207
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:13,098
Come here, Milord! Who's a good kitty?

208
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:15,733
That's not him.

209
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,721
Not there, either.

210
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,175
Milord, where are you hiding?

211
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,757
If I can just find the cat,

212
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,452
maybe it'll trigger a buried memory.

213
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:26,135
Milord! Here, boy!

214
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,627
Come on out, kitty!

215
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,634
I feel so sleepy again.

216
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,076
What is that strange smell?

217
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,290
Milord!

218
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,279
Come on out now, kitty!

219
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,319
Come on! I've got some nice catnip for you!

220
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:02,497
Better find him fast. It's getting stormy out.

221
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:04,727
Huh?

222
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:09,438
Milord!

223
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Hold on, just stay there! There's no need to run.

224
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,967
What's the matter, boy?

225
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,570
Smells nice.

226
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:35,223
Smells nice...

227
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:43,063
Just small ones, but there are too many of them.

228
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,763
The numbers aren't on my side, here!

229
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:49,467
You provoked them, didn't you? Just like a cat!

230
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:53,523
Milord, you know what they say
about curiosity and cats, don't you?

231
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,325
Smells nice.

232
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:07,179
And in you go.

233
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,510
A lot of good that did.

234
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,796
Hanki! Come!

235
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,293
Oh, crap! I forgot I don't have a regalia.

236
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:31,572
This chick again?

237
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:36,874
What is that thing?

238
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,278
You want a piece of me?

239
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,611
You idiot! Don't...

240
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:58,120
Let's go! Jungle Savate!

241
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:13,888
Whoa! It worked! The great Tono has
blessed me with a fraction of his mighty power!

242
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,809
Oh! I'll be your devoted follower forever, my lord!

243
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,271
I think we finally lost it.

244
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,704
This girl saved me again. I can't freakin' believe it.

245
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,434
I'm glad I was able to track you down, Yato.
I had a lot of questions to ask you, you know,

246
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:55,229
but you just suddenly ran off on me. No dodging my
questions this time. I want some straight answers!

247
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:58,594
Uhh, sorry, but your soul? It's slipped out.

248
00:18:58,648 --> 00:18:59,430
What?

249
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:01,723
Huh?

250
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,555
If you want your body, it's back over there.

251
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,824
Wha...? How's that possible?

252
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,438
Wh-what happened? Does this mean that I'm dead?

253
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:13,918
That's not it exactly.
It's more like your body's just taking a nap.

254
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:30,166
Look what you've done.
I thought black cats were supposed to be unlucky.

255
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:37,671
I'll hand out fliers and look
around some more tomorrow. Okay?

256
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,742
Don't worry, sweetie. I'm sure he'll turn up.

257
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,089
Hello?

258
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,403
You came home!

259
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:59,062
Mom, it's Milord! He came back!

260
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:05,228
Can you believe it? My wish really came
true! Thanks, Yato! You're the best ever!

261
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,132
That smells nice.

262
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,151
Hey, what are you doing? Put me down, you creep!

263
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,898
I'm not a creep! I'm a god!

264
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:23,650
Yeah, about that, why do I have a... Hey, it's gone.

265
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:27,388
I swear I had a tail. Was it all a dream?

266
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:29,867
That has to be it.

267
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:34,732
What's going on with me? I don't understand any of this.

268
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,988
It must be a result of the accident.

269
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,634
There's the near shore, where the living reside,
then there's the far shore.

270
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:46,626
Somehow or other, you've wound up in the divide
between them.

271
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,323
The near shore and the far shore?

272
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,070
Yeah. As for the far shore, what would you humans call it?

273
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,090
The afterlife, I guess.

274
00:20:56,562 --> 00:21:00,287
See, you're still technically alive,
but you're also a phantom.

275
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,970
What's a phantom?

276
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,171
Basically, they're incarnations of emotional energy.
They possess people and cause a lot of trouble.

277
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,347
So that giant frog earlier.
That was one of these "phantoms"?

278
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,331
Yeah, that's right.

279
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,763
You mean I'm like that thing?

280
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,997
Well, no, not exactly like it.

281
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,563
Actually, I'd describe you more as "on the fence."

282
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:23,745
And that means what? All this is way over my head!

283
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,952
Well, for one thing, you'll probably lose your body a lot.

284
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:32,242
Okay, and how do I make that stop?

285
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,219
Well... I'm not sure you can. This is
just the way you are now. Best accept it.

286
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:41,605
Accept it? I can't live like
this! It's not fair! Turn me back!

287
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:44,480
You keep on saying you're a god, right? So help me!

288
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,922
All right. Pay up.

289
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:47,953
Gods charge money now?

290
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,098
Of course we do!

291
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:53,594
Nobody's gonna grant a wish for nothing!
This is the going rate for one wish.

292
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,108
What? 550,000?! I can't afford that much!

293
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,101
Tch. Stupid mortal. I am a god, you know?

294
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:05,175
And what do you offer when you petition
the gods? That's right! A 5 yen coin!

295
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:11,492
What? 5?
Uh, okay.

296
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:19,888
You have made a wish, and it's been heard, loud and clear!

297
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,658
Hiyori Iki.

298
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,165
Thus is it done, may our fates intertwine.

299
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,354
Step one in operation make Yato a major god:
Come up with a new chant for litter-bearers.

300
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,748
Why won't the regular old "Heave-ho" work?

301
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:07,912
Instead of "heave-ho" let's go with "Ya-ho."

302
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:10,563
Next time on Noragami: "Snow-like."

303
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,595
Remember, it's "Ya-ho, Yato!"
