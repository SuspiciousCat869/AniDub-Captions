1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,665
Help us!

2
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,363
Please! Yato needs you!

3
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,059
Ya...

4
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,047
Border!

5
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:44,699
A Borderline?

6
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:51,825
Take it down! Please let us in! Daikoku! Kofuku!

7
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,877
Don't just stand there! Can't you see?

8
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,437
Yato's going to die!

9
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,851
You're the only one I'm letting inside.

10
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,342
Kofuku. Can you purify Hiyori and cleanse her blight?

11
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,012
Right.

12
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:24,836
This water's pure. It's pumped in directly from the
spring in the garden. Come over here and wash your body.

13
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:26,170
What about Yato?

14
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,484
It's too late for Yatty's blight to be cleansed now.

15
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,906
It can't be! How?

16
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:34,387
Yuki...

17
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,895
He needs to be punished.

18
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:46,572
Kofuku. Take over for a while.

19
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,423
I'm gonna visit some nearby shrines.

20
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:49,988
What?

21
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,776
Why do you need to do that?

22
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,708
What is Yukine's punishment?

23
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:55,202
He needs ablution.

24
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,482
Huh?

25
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:02,061
An ablution's a ceremony for expelling blight.
But it requires three Regalias to pull it off.

26
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,064
So we'll need two more besides me.

27
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:09,823
Just to be clear here. You know what'll
happen if the ablution fails. You do, right?

28
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:10,738
Yeah.

29
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,669
Regardless... We need the other Regalias here right away.

30
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,344
He doesn't look like he'll even last until the morning.

31
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:24,552
Yukine.

32
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,897
Take one step from where you're
standing and I will kill you.

33
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,151
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:49,419
That's cold!

35
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,102
Yato is seriously on the verge of death.

36
00:03:56,641 --> 00:04:00,320
But what exactly are they going to do to punish Yukine?

37
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:12,904
Please. Please, please. Just let them both be
okay. Actually... I never really thought about it but,

38
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,397
Who does help gods and Regalias?

39
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,932
Yato's truly dying?

40
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:22,844
Yes.

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,166
An actual ablution?

42
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,441
If you don't do it correctly,
you can get eaten by a Phantom.

43
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,425
What? Are you serious?

44
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,631
I had a friend who took part in one.

45
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,549
It was a serious ablution and she helped out.

46
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:37,821
What happened to her?

47
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,109
Is she okay?

48
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:40,261
I don't know.

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,665
Nobody has seen her since it took place.

50
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:48,287
If you'll permit it. I can help.

51
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,167
Hey, hold on! You aren't serious, are you?

52
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,009
Yato did grant me the name Tomo at one time.

53
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,925
Thank you. And who are...?

54
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,868
Mayu, now.

55
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,414
We only need one more, then.

56
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:12,272
I greatly appreciate your assistance. I
ask no more. You've been generous enough.

57
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:18,258
Please try not to fret over this. Worrying
would only affect Lord Tenjin's health.

58
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:24,122
My Lord.

59
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:31,383
Yato's been corrupted. How could
that fool allow this? What is he doing?

60
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,684
Please hear me out.

61
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,009
Would you kindly allow me to borrow one Regalia?

62
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,905
I humbly beg of you.

63
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,348
Please!

64
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,232
When corruption has already set in.

65
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:46,895
There's no guarantee that
using Regalias can save a master.

66
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:51,722
What kind of Regalia inflicts this
much upon its master in the first place?

67
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:56,015
You must slay Yukine, Yato.

68
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:06,460
Daikoku! Yeah okay... what?

69
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,693
You could only find one Regalia?

70
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,299
What are we gonna do, Daikoku?

71
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,081
Keep looking. That's the only thing I can do.

72
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:24,277
Yeah. I-I know. Mm, right. I'll call you back later
with an update. The only other gods around here are...

73
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:36,977
We've gotta do something. If we can't find
someone else to help us, Yatty's gonna die.

74
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,876
Just one more! I need to find one more Regalia.

75
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:56,995
There's always Nora. I'm certain she'd come to Yato's aid.

76
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,063
Except, what would be the cost?

77
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:05,173
You know I'm good. I can kill
anything in your way with no trouble.

78
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:10,187
She just might kill Yukine. In that case.

79
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:19,616
You should be more careful.

80
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:24,808
If you cross paths with Bishamon again, keep
your head down, or things could go badly for you.

81
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,782
This is no time to be afraid.

82
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,161
Come out, Kazuma! I need your help! Please, Kazuma!

83
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,422
Has there been activity in the northeast?

84
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:46,854
It's all fairly quiet. There are no
signs of any vent openings for now.

85
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,513
And in the southeast?

86
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,204
All clear... Nothing to report.
I'll continue to remain alert though.

87
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,591
I'm really sorry, Kazuma, but well...

88
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:55,266
Hm?

89
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,299
A girl's been calling for you
outside a shrine for a while now.

90
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,682
What is it? Well?

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,240
Sorry it's nothing.

92
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:08,474
This girl's too ill-mannered
to even offer a bow. Ignore her.

93
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,133
Okay.

94
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,383
Now then. Let's get back to your reports.

95
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,792
Please, Kazuma! You have to talk
to me! Please, I need your help!

96
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:20,475
We're talking life and death here, Kazuma! Plea...

97
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:27,246
You couldn't find one more person! You dummy, what's
wrong with you? You didn't even try looking, did you?

98
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:33,488
Of course I looked! But no one is willing to take the risk
to help the Regalia of a god they've never even heard of.

99
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,056
Please try to hang in there. We're trying. Please, Yato!

100
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,919
Didn't I tell you not to move?

101
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:45,180
Do I look like I care?

102
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:49,453
And where are you going?

103
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:50,899
Kazuma?

104
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,718
Who is that?

105
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,560
How's Yato holding up?

106
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:58,087
Hold on, isn't Yato your master's sworn enemy?

107
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:01,718
He is. But I personally owe him a debt.

108
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:05,691
On top of that. She came to me for help.

109
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:07,344
Yori?

110
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:13,854
I suggest you give her a stern lecture. I've
warned her myself, yet she came right to our front door.

111
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,822
Veena would've killed her if she had known.

112
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,349
Well, I don't know what kind of debt you
owe him, but we've got our three Regalias now.

113
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:26,103
You do. But the state he's in?

114
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:32,933
This is not going to be easy.

115
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:41,058
Yato. Can you hear me? You need to banish
Yukine. You can't endure this for much longer.

116
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,706
Yato!

117
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,312
He just won't listen to reason.

118
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,220
That's why an ablution is the only way we can save him.

119
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,333
Yukine. What'd you do?

120
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,400
I don't know. Nothing.

121
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:59,000
If that's true, then why were you just trying to leave?

122
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:00,968
'Cuz I wanted to, okay?

123
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:04,296
Or maybe it's because you can't handle the guilt you feel.

124
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:09,159
Or it's because I'm sick and tired of all
of you! I said I didn't do anything, alright?

125
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:12,955
Is that so? Then you wouldn't
mind taking off your shirt for a sec.

126
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,065
Uh, what? Why should I?

127
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,351
Just shut up and do what I say.

128
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:33,650
What is that?

129
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,872
Damn it! You stung your master that much?

130
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:39,323
Are you ready to do this?

131
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,059
Yes.

132
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,916
Hurry and get it off me! Please, just get it off!

133
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:52,326
We now cleanse this spirit belonging to the god
Yato, and we preserve the name with which it was graced.

134
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:54,813
What is this?

135
00:10:54,838 --> 00:11:00,382
With defilement expelled and avarice removed. We
bring forth a sincere, principled, and just soul.

136
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:03,696
With flesh pared may he be cleansed.

137
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,684
What're they?

138
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,936
An ablution involves purifying the flesh through burning.

139
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:34,178
They're using the Regalia borderlines
to hold him in place and cleanse him.

140
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,671
They're doing... what?

141
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:41,153
They all used to be human. Only Regalias
may judge the sins of other Regalias.

142
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,821
Stop it! Let me out, damn it!

143
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:49,685
And once an ablution has officially
begun, it's not safe to stop until it's over.

144
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,024
Not until the Regalia has confessed and
repented all of their sins. Every last one of them.

145
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:59,037
Yukine! Confess your evils! Do it now!

146
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:02,264
Shut up! I'll kill you for this!

147
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,735
But if he refuses...

148
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,969
Harder! He's becoming a phantom!

149
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:31,193
Stop watching!

150
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:35,346
This is cruel! You have to stop them! He can't take it!

151
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:42,687
I didn't do anything to deserve this! Why
the hell are you putting me through this?

152
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,736
I didn't do anything wrong!

153
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:52,046
All of this just 'cuz of some loose change?

154
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,317
So I stole some stuff, and I broke some
stuff! Who freaking cares? I didn't hurt anyone!

155
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:06,910
Don't act like you don't understand
me! It's because we're dead!

156
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:13,305
But they're not! They have everything!
And they don't even appreciate it!

157
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:14,934
My folks are really pissing me off.

158
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,267
I had my brother help me.

159
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,088
C'mon! We're your friends!

160
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,312
A future, memories, a family and friends...

161
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:31,086
They get to have everything.
Everything that's been taken from me.

162
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,566
They've got it all and I have nothing!

163
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:44,153
It's not fair.

164
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,647
I'm completely alone.

165
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,053
And I have nothing.

166
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,552
Nothing at all.

167
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:58,057
You have such pretty eyes for a boy. They
remind me of the fruit on hawthorn plants.

168
00:13:58,857 --> 00:13:59,719
You know.

169
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,228
Not even birds will eat the hawthorn fruit.

170
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:10,287
Not because of their taste. They aren't
poisonous or anything. They're just empty is all.

171
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,831
Useless, empty fruit. They offer nothing.
And of course nobody bothers to pick them.

172
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,389
So they're left on the plant to wilt, wither, and die.

173
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:24,423
and die...

174
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,674
Poor, lonely little boy.

175
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:49,041
So what if I stole a few things? And why does it matter
if I smashed up some stuff? Everyone should be like me.

176
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,054
They should be like me and die!

177
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:15,573
It's just no use! He's fighting too much!

178
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:18,997
Daikoku! Change into the Kokki and slay him!

179
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,329
Keep your cool, you mousy dumbass!

180
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:27,283
It'll collapse if I transform now! And
besides. I'd just open up a vent in my Kokki form.

181
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:29,953
Now quit freakin' out and try to think clearly!

182
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:42,683
Look!

183
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:46,033
If his mark gets enveloped, we're screwed!

184
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,644
Don't you give up now!

185
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,365
His name. I need to say it. I need to call his name.

186
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,010
Before it disappears.

187
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,715
When I picked him, I had a feeling
he was more than a pretty face.

188
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,368
Isn't that right, Yukine?

189
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:25,483
I can't let him cross to the other side.

190
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:29,761
I need to call his name.

191
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,147
Yukine!

192
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,458
Yori, No!

193
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:46,519
Hey! Get away! It's too dangerous!

194
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:51,623
Yukine! Don't cross to the other side!
You can't let yourself become a Phantom!

195
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:06,796
Listen to me, Yukine! Yato is still here for you!
I know you know that's true! I know you heard him!

196
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:13,066
He's a stupid punk with an attitude
problem, but I found him, and I named him.

197
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,848
Sekki! I will re-forge you!

198
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:20,818
That's what he said. He cares about you like a father!

199
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:32,714
Think about it. Even when you kept on
betraying Yato and hurting him, he just endured it!

200
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:41,999
But if you keep hurting someone who's that good
to you, Then I... can't be friends with you anymore!

201
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,257
Friends...

202
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,925
You're my friend?

203
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:58,377
Yukine!

204
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:06,355
I know it's hard, and it's not
fair. You can't be with people anymore.

205
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,874
I'm sorry that you're no longer like them.

206
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:17,206
But, Yukine... I granted you the name of a person!

207
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:20,996
So...

208
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,725
You can still live as a person! You can live, Yukine!

209
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,800
Yato...

210
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,778
I'm so...

211
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm so sorry.

212
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:56,362
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! I kept on stinging Yato! I
stole money! And Hiyori. I... I tried to feel her up!

213
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:05,295
I stole the skateboard, too. And I smashed
out all the windows! And I told so many lies!

214
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,219
I won't do it anymore!

215
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:10,917
I promise!

216
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,912
I'm really sorry for everything!

217
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:16,587
I'm sorry!

218
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,676
Okay! There's no blight to be found!

219
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,068
I thought I was a dead man.

220
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:55,014
But you are dead.

221
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:58,199
Why does punishment gotta be so exhausting?

222
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:02,450
I wanna thank you guys for helping
out this dimwit. I appreciate it.

223
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,356
I would hope you do.

224
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:08,798
You too, Hiyori. I never thought
it'd cause you this much trouble.

225
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:10,649
Yukine.

226
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:11,970
Come here, buddy.

227
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,371
I'm sorry! Now you tell her, too!

228
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:19,547
Hiyori. I'm sorry!

229
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,465
Hiyori.

230
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,199
If she hadn't thought to bring us here.

231
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:28,535
I'm sure I would've died where I was.

232
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:34,572
Also, if she had chosen Nora as one of the Regalias.

233
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:39,564
Well, the pain was so intense, I might
have been tempted to use Nora to end it.

234
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:44,294
And of course, if she hadn't stopped Yukine when she did...

235
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:47,404
If she... hadn't been by my side.

236
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,254
She saved us.

237
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,513
She made every right move and saved us.

238
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:03,401
I'm so relieved! I'm so glad you're both okay!

239
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:10,574
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

240
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,186
Thank you.

241
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,942
The stew has now started to
bubble. Is it ready to eat?

242
00:23:10,218 --> 00:23:15,384
I'll taste it and see for
myself. Munch, munch, munch.

243
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:21,629
I really thought the Phantoms were
gonna munch him up for sure back there.

244
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:26,793
Well, now I know that waking you
up was the right choice after all.

245
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,944
Rabo.

246
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:38,083
The stew has now started to bubble. Is it
ready to eat? I'll taste it and see for myself.

247
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:40,259
It is ready.

248
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:43,498
Yato.

249
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,498
Is he truly the former god of calamity?

250
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,379
The Yato?

251
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,090
I suppose you'll just have to find out for yourself.

252
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:00,957
Next time, on Noragami: "Regarded with Hate."

253
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:03,667
So, it's nice to meet you. I'm Mayu.

254
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,382
Oh, yeah, my name. I'm Daikoku.

255
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:07,629
I'm Kazuma. Sorry, but I've gotta go now.

256
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,422
Same here.

257
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,308
Uh... Sure.

258
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:09,847
Later.

259
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:12,658
Man, those two are surprisingly alike.
