1
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,380
Things have changed.

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:04,380
I'm not the same as I used to be.

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:11,316
I'm a different girl, and I have been ever
since the day I met that guy who insists he's a god.

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,767
Ugh.

5
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:31,166
I can still touch things even
without my body. That's cool.

6
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,974
Hiyori.

7
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:20,598
Hiyori!

8
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:23,122
Are you with us, Hiyori?

9
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:25,566
Yes?

10
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,496
Whoops. Was I asleep again?

11
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:32,419
Yes, you were. If you're not feeling
well, you should go to the nurse's office.

12
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:35,490
I'll be fine, I swear. I'm really sorry.

13
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,855
I'm so sleepy all the time. I hate it.

14
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:00,836
I've been feeling like this ever
since the incident with the bus.

15
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:06,785
And it's more than just drowsy spells.

16
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:13,587
The forecast says it's gonna snow today.

17
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:14,872
Cold snow.

18
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:17,042
Aw, man. That's no fun.

19
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,019
Snow. Cold snow.

20
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,709
Well, come on. Let's go!

21
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:23,630
You're gonna be late.

22
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:24,764
Oh right!

23
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,394
Nobody else can see what I see.

24
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,617
It's a being that dwells beyond normal people's sight.

25
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,030
A phantom.

26
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,003
White snow.

27
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,658
What's so special about me that I can see them now?

28
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:43,460
Hello! Wake up, sleeping beauty!

29
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,734
Wow, again? This is crazy!

30
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:52,627
Totally. I bet this insta-snooze trick
of hers comes in handy sometimes, though.

31
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,303
So she's a closet martial arts nerd and a narcoleptic.

32
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,626
That's a combination you don't see every day, huh?

33
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:03,562
No kidding. We should warn her
her panties show when this happens.

34
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,053
Yeah, that way she can wear something appropriate.

35
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,878
Something non-descript would work best.

36
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,624
Nah, something that's super cute.

37
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,648
This is all so strange.

38
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:15,828
Even so...

39
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,356
It does have its moments!

40
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,190
Whee!

41
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,325
I'm a bird! I'm a bird! I'm a pretty, flying bird!

42
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,915
Look at me! I'm a bird!

43
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,423
Phantoms can be found everywhere.

44
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,063
Lurking in the shadows of an alley.

45
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,453
Soaring through the sky.

46
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,303
Sitting on people's shoulders.

47
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:07,315
They're not the same. They come
in different shapes and sizes.

48
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,077
But they are all denizens of
the far shore. Devoid of life.

49
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:26,434
They're mostly invisible. The only ones
who can see them are young children, animals.

50
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:33,150
And, of course, those of us who roam
the divide between the near and far shores.

51
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:47,075
A black haze in the distance. So that's a "storm."

52
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:52,810
An area thick with despair that attracts
all kinds of phantoms. It gives me the creeps.

53
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,087
Yato told me a little about phantoms.

54
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:59,882
They possess people and then those people
lose all hope and spiral out of control.

55
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,930
That's what I'm dealing with,
and Yato still hasn't contacted me?

56
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,819
Ah, hello, there. Nice to talk to you again.

57
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,660
What can I do for ya?

58
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:17,773
Don't give me that! You said you'd help
with the phantoms and the tail and everything.

59
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:21,035
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I'll get to it eventually.

60
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,312
Could you be more specific? Exactly how
long is "eventually"? It's been two weeks!

61
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:28,467
Look, some unexpected stuff came up recently.

62
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:32,277
Stuff I have to deal with before I
can even think about doing anything else.

63
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,186
So I can't get to you quite yet.

64
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,235
Be straight with me. Are you really a god or not?

65
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:39,370
You doubt me?

66
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:41,878
Don't. I'm the real deal.

67
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,459
Do you know any humans who can do that trick?

68
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,691
You should be in awe of my magnificence!

69
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,689
You're wearing a tracksuit and
a weird bib around your neck.

70
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:52,520
That isn't really an awe-inspiring outfit.

71
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:58,148
You shouldn't judge people by the clothing they
wear. Didn't your parents ever teach you that lesson?

72
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:00,442
And it's not a bib, it's a fluffy-fluff scarf.

73
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,824
Fluffy fluff scarf?

74
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,719
Did you see that girl over
there? She's talking to herself.

75
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,413
Don't stare. She probably isn't right in the head.

76
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,663
Explain something to me. What's the
difference between you and phantoms?

77
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,347
Huh?

78
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,906
I mean, you have things in common.
You're invisible to most people.

79
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,225
And the same thing goes for phantoms, doesn't it?

80
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,377
Unlike them, I'm actually from the far shore.

81
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:29,058
I wasn't born from a human being.
I'm a god of war, born from a wish.

82
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,154
Yeah?

83
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,155
Yeah, between the two of us,
I'd say you're more like a phantom.

84
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,528
Huh?

85
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,371
Not again! I didn't even notice it happening!

86
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,117
Hey! You're a ghost! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

87
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,034
This isn't a joke, you jerk!

88
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,470
In all seriousness. This bare
form of yours isn't safe at all.

89
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:48,716
You should be careful.

90
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,203
A living phantom makes a very tempting target.

91
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:54,726
They will come for you.

92
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,736
They'll come, eager to corrupt your soul and consume it.

93
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,226
And once you're possessed by
a phantom you lose who you are.

94
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:07,115
You'll cross lines that shouldn't be
crossed, and you won't even hesitate.

95
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:13,477
Because what you'll find beyond may be a
living hell, but it's a pleasurable one.

96
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:19,903
Well, when you put it that way, would you fix me already?

97
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:25,949
I remember our contract, don't worry. You
paid your 5 yen piece. And it's non-refundable!

98
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:31,406
Yeah it's my money now. I'm saving
up for a shrine that's nice and big!

99
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:38,929
By the station with a wife and a separate
bathroom. Yes, a shrine just for me!

100
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:44,534
How is this, Lord Yato? Am I
massaging your right leg to your liking?

101
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:47,129
What about your left leg, Lord Yato?

102
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,105
Ah most agreeable.

103
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,107
I am Yato! An almighty god of war!

104
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:03,323
Now, then go forth and pick out the
peanuts from a bag of mixed nuts for me!

105
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,878
Yes! As you wish, sir!

106
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,101
Oh, yeah, I like that!

107
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,991
So, anyway, when will you get to my job?

108
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,866
Huh? Soon enough.

109
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,923
I told you to sit tight, didn't I?

110
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,034
You've been telling me that since
last week. I'm sick of waiting!

111
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:27,273
Oh, last week, huh? Well here's a proposition,
then. Call me "Lord Yato." It'll show some respect.

112
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:30,391
Do that for an entire week and
I'll consider starting your job.

113
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:33,980
I mean, seriously, who calls a
god by his first name, anyway?

114
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,788
I could call you something else.

115
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:44,354
Fine the truth is I'm not at 100 % right now. I
can't take on a big job. Not until I find a Regalia.

116
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,687
Okay, and what exactly is a Regalia?

117
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:51,635
Regalias are tools. They serve as weapons for gods.

118
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:55,233
When I have a Regalia I can cut down anything.

119
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:55,878
Oh.

120
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,737
So that why you completely unused right now.

121
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,169
So you use to have a Regalia then.

122
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,506
Did you lose it?

123
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:03,975
Why?

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,213
Lose a Regalia? No, she qui...

125
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,189
I fired her.

126
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,933
Regalias are people?

127
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,323
Well, they're spirits.

128
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,100
Oh. Really?

129
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:23,418
Hello! Thank you for calling delivery
god Yato. I'm fast and affordable!

130
00:10:23,604 --> 00:10:25,820
Need help, you say? I'll be right there!

131
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,290
Wait!

132
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,965
I do not like that guy.

133
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,719
I got everything I need. Why
should I bother getting some dumb job?

134
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,033
I don't need work. My parents support me.

135
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,797
Do you see them, Hiyori? Those
are "lazy bums". Scary, aren't they?

136
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,361
I mean, it's not like I can't get a
job, it's just that I don't want to.

137
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:49,825
That's it! He's one of those lazy
bums mother was always warning me about.

138
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,455
But what now? It's not like I
have anybody else to turn to.

139
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:56,590
What should I do?

140
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:03,407
Your fists will guide you! Pave your own way!

141
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:05,756
That's it! I'll listen to the great Tono!

142
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,891
He's right! I can't rely on others for everything!

143
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,517
I gotta take matters into my own hands!

144
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,436
I've got it! If he needs a Regalia, I'll find him one!

145
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,394
Excuse me! What would you think about
being a Regalia for a guy named Yato?

146
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,133
Excuse me! Hello there!

147
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:46,191
A storm.

148
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,950
There are a ton of spirits in there.
I bet at least one will hear me out!

149
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:12,293
Wow. Never seen that trick before. You using toilet paper?

150
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:17,224
Yep. If you stick it on the wall like this, you can
get all the mold off without having it drip everywhere.

151
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:20,700
To be really thorough, I'd leave it
for half a day before rinsing it off.

152
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:24,459
Man, you really are a pro, aren't ya?

153
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:25,824
A pro?

154
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,986
I appreciate ya comin' over so quickly,
too. Maybe I'll become a repeat customer.

155
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,704
Please! That would be great!

156
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,592
Well, I'll leave ya to it.

157
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:39,121
Oh, by the way. Do you have an old toothbrush I could use?

158
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:40,144
Say what?

159
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,957
It's what you need for mold that's
particularly thick, like it is here.

160
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:58,153
You did a great job, kid! I just called you in for a
leaky faucet. But, this place has never been cleaner!

161
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:58,875
Thanks.

162
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:03,654
I feel bad payin' just 5 yen. I know! Here's a tip.

163
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:11,015
Ah, man, some god of war I am. How pathetic.

164
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:15,510
I spent my day repairing a leaky pipe
and cleaning up mold for chump change.

165
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:26,620
Now that's tasty! At least I got a drink out of it, huh?

166
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,722
Well, I'm already here. I might
as well crash at ol' tenjin's place.

167
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,361
Looks like business is boomin' for him!

168
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,280
How's it go again? "You can check out any time
you want, but you can never leave." Or something.

169
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:47,136
Looks like it's especially stormy out tonight, huh?

170
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,668
So that Hiyori girl's job request.

171
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,124
What am I gonna do abou...

172
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,429
Who's calling now?

173
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:11,177
Oh, great. Her again. This is really getting old.

174
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,399
Yeah, hello. What can I do for ya, Hiyori?

175
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:20,540
Hey! Sorry to bother you this late, but, uh...

176
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,113
I've got something. I-I think I
found a Regalia for you, actually.

177
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:25,866
Huh?

178
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,571
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,682
Well... here he is! What do you think of him?

180
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:37,256
Lia-Regalia.

181
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,070
Run away!

182
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:47,202
You thought that could be a Regalia?

183
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:50,164
Sure, why wouldn't I? You did
tell me that Regalias were spirits!

184
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:55,025
That's an ordinary ol' phantom! A twisted ball
of emotions and curses! Can't you tell that much?

185
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,340
Well, yes! Actually, that's what I
thought when I first spotted it, too.

186
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,121
Smells nice!

187
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:05,729
But then I remembered what you said earlier about
not making judgments based on how things first appear.

188
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:09,935
This is how you chose to apply that
lesson? You've got awesome timing!

189
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,719
And there's one more thing, too.

190
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:16,492
I got separated from my body again!

191
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:18,351
Your timing seriously sucks.

192
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:25,353
Hiyori!

193
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:33,889
Oh yeah, that's right! I forgot. I'm
actually a halfway decent fighter in this form!

194
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:39,148
It's okay! I'm fine! I can take care of this guy myself.

195
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,268
Hey, there, ugly. Come and get me!

196
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,681
Here I go!

197
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:49,370
Jungle Savate!

198
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:10,496
Come on!

199
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:33,087
Hey, what happened? Your hand really
isn't looking so good. Are you o...

200
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,343
I'm fine. Don't touch me. Or it will blight you, too.

201
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:37,569
What do you mean?

202
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:41,751
A blight is a kind of defilement. One that can spread.

203
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:47,495
Unless you exorcise, or cleanse, it,
it'll stay there and eat away at you.

204
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,961
Smells nice.

205
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,686
Also, we need to talk about your backside.

206
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:54,401
What?

207
00:16:55,398 --> 00:17:00,896
That thing ain't a tail. It connects your
physical and ethereal forms. Like a lifeline.

208
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,864
Nice smell!

209
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,795
If something happens to sever it.

210
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,580
Then you'll die!

211
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:16,920
No way! You mean I'm not wireless? That's not cool!

212
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:21,619
That's your worry? Listen, human! You're out
of your league trying to fight that phantom.

213
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:24,111
Don't do anything like that again!

214
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:27,891
But you said yourself that you can't
do anything without a Regalia, right?

215
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,493
Back off! I've been trying to find one, okay? I have to...

216
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:40,719
A young boy.

217
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,366
Not so young... looks to be in his teens, I'd say.

218
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,082
A difficult enough age for anybody.

219
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,435
Smells nice!

220
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,057
Uh, Yato.

221
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:54,178
I think he'll do.

222
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,013
Smells nice!

223
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:16,488
Spirit, you are lost and adrift. You
have nowhere to go and nowhere to return to.

224
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,519
Thus, I grant you a place to belong. My name is Yato.

225
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:27,175
Bearing two names, you shall remain here.
With these names, I make thee my servant.

226
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:33,116
With these names I use my life to make
thee a Regalia, fit to be wielded by a god.

227
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:39,457
Thou art Yuki! As Regalia, Sekki! Come Sekki!

228
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:05,962
A sword?

229
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:24,040
Yato!

230
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:30,786
No!

231
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,999
Yato!

232
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:43,883
This is the land of the rising sun.
Your desecration shall not be allowed.

233
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:53,938
Hear me. I am the god Yato. I now lay thee waste with
the Sekki and expel thy vast defilement! I cleanse thee!

234
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:55,398
Rend!

235
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:16,986
That's so...

236
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,199
Wait, was he just crying?

237
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,527
I found my body and brought it back!

238
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,545
It's so cold! What are you doing?

239
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:44,418
I have to cleanse the blight from my hand.

240
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:52,237
So all it takes is a little water?

241
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,883
This day wasn't a total waste, after all.

242
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,119
It's a lucky thing we ran into an
uncorrupted spirit. Really lucky.

243
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,114
The blade's the perfect length.

244
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:05,959
Wow! So that's a Regalia!

245
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:07,788
Cool!

246
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,324
It's looks sharp and shiny. Which I'm guessing is good.

247
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:16,499
Sure is. Name's Yuki. Or, less formally, Yukine.

248
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:21,717
Whoa!

249
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:28,574
It became a boy!

250
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,168
Yukine.

251
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:35,853
I am Yato.

252
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:37,782
I'm your master now.

253
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,886
I summoned you here from the far shore to be my Regalia.

254
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:46,689
You will remain by my side. You
need not return from whence you came.

255
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:48,223
Take this.

256
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:52,174
Go on. You've nothing to fear.

257
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:57,154
I don't want a stinky tracksuit.

258
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:05,003
Um, well, take this.

259
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,700
It's cold out here.

260
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,410
Can we get inside, already?

261
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,699
Hey. You hear me?

262
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,947
Are you cold? You can put on my fluffy-fluff scarf.

263
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,952
Thanks for the offer, really. But I think I'm okay.

264
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:09,111
Next time, on Noragami: "Bidden calamity."

265
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:10,909
Oh, go on, just take the scarf.

266
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,489
I'm gonna pass.
