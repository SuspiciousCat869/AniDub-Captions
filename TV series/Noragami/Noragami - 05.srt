1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:03,476
See! Here we have a little phantom.

2
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:07,207
What are you doing, Yato?

3
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,384
Good! We want that reaction.

4
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:12,236
Hate and fear will help you draw a borderline.

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:13,460
And what's that?

6
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:18,418
A borderline is what serves as a
regalia's shield. It's also his only weapon.

7
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:21,373
Now, then. You did some pretty nice work the other day.

8
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,929
I think you're ready for this.

9
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,800
Humph! Flattery won't get you anywhere.

10
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:29,260
It's real simple. Make your fingers into a halberd.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,910
Then use them to draw a line like this between you and it.

12
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,321
Uh, okay.

13
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:40,188
Here goes!

14
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:45,369
Amazing! So that's what you were talking about?

15
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:51,533
Yep. Useful stuff. Phantoms can't cross it. It
acts as a boundary between "self" and "other."

16
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:55,715
Is it something you can do, too? Or-or even me?

17
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:59,923
No. You and I can't do this.
Borderlines are a regalia power.

18
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,680
Any regalia should be able to make one.

19
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,476
But creating one that's this strong without practice...

20
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:10,628
I've never known a regalia
who could do that. It's a first.

21
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,866
Speaking of the Regalias that he knows...

22
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:24,490
So, um. That girl we ran into down by
the water. Nora? She's a regalia, too?

23
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:26,675
Oh, Nora, huh?

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,037
How to put it...

25
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,294
I guess you could call her a friend with benefits.

26
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:35,680
Eh...

27
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:09,342
I've decided that I'm going to look after Yukine.

28
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:10,175
Huh?

29
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,283
You are? That's crazy. He can't
stay with you. It would never work.

30
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:17,941
It makes more sense for him to stay with me than with you.

31
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:21,657
You don't have a place to live or what
even resembles any sort of stable life.

32
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,240
It's all ex-girlfriends,
affairs, and friends with benefits.

33
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:28,588
You're depraved, irresponsible,
and unfit to be anyone's guardian!

34
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,438
Yukine is obviously better off in
my care. You'll just corrupt him!

35
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:38,453
Get away from her!

36
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,404
Stop that! What are you doing to the poor thing?

37
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:46,020
Ahh! Come on! I'm getting stung like crazy here!

38
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:49,577
Quit it! Can't you see you're hurting him?
You're gonna pull his arm out of the socket!

39
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:53,102
You think he's hurting, look at
me! I'm getting seriously stung!

40
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,439
Jeez! Are you crazy? What's your problem?

41
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:02,747
I told you! When he has naughty
thoughts, I'm the one who pays for it.

42
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,620
Every one of 'em stings me!

43
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,261
What do you mean naughty thoughts?

44
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:10,677
Ugh, please! You were just
talking about him living with you.

45
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,503
At his age, that's basically guaranteeing
a whole crap ton of dirty thoughts!

46
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:17,219
The answer is no! He'll be staying with me!

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,683
You know, I think it's really someone
else who has his mind in the gutter.

48
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:26,425
Unlike you, he's a good boy. There's nothing
to worry about. Now, come with me, Yukine.

49
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:28,616
No, Yukine! Don't you dare!

50
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:45,488
Your house is freakin' huge!

51
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,886
You must be really rich or something, huh?

52
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,978
Don't be silly. I'm just an ordinary teenager.

53
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:57,335
Yeah, well, this doesn't look very ordinary
to me. Are your parents around here somewhere?

54
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,895
We got lucky. It looks like
they're actually out late tonight.

55
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,903
Huh? You mean it's just you and
me? We have the whole place to our...

56
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,327
oh, no! Sh!

57
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,264
Ah, I thought I heard you, Hiyori.

58
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,051
Yeah, it's me, Sasaki.

59
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,376
Nice evening, isn't it?

60
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:22,558
I have a bath drawn for you. Feel free
to hop in whenever you're ready, dear!

61
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,732
Whoa! This is awesome!

62
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,994
Go ahead and make yourself at home you can stay in here.

63
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,854
Huh? Really? Isn't this your room, though?

64
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,049
No. It's my big brother's.

65
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,232
Your brother?

66
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,703
Yeah. He's a lot older than me.

67
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,975
He doesn't live here anymore, so the room's all yours.

68
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,201
Oh, okay.

69
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,386
It's great. If you're sure.

70
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:00,167
I'm not far. My room's next door.

71
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:03,876
Let me know if you need anything. Well, see you in a bit!

72
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,310
Looks like Hiyori's really living a dream life, isn't she?

73
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:26,532
Everything went as planned. We made a stealthy
entrance, unnoticed by our housekeeper or my parents.

74
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,017
Oh! Hi, you guys!

75
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,631
Surprise! We're early!

76
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,195
Lookie! We brought home a tasty snack!

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,425
Well. I think I'll have a
nightcap if it's okay with you, dear.

78
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,043
Oh! You're absolutely incorrigible!

79
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:48,728
This is the best part of my
day! And now for a little snack.

80
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:52,125
Don't eat too much, now. Have you washed your hands, dear?

81
00:06:57,732 --> 00:07:01,615
What are you doing? You know you're
supposed to be watching your cholesterol!

82
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,785
But I was just having a little.

83
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,936
Your mom sure doesn't miss much, does she?

84
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,819
What are you doing here? This is my house!

85
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:13,304
Jeez what's the big deal? It's not
like they're gonna notice that I'm here.

86
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:16,535
The whole point was to separate
Yukine from your bad influence!

87
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:20,503
Speaking of, how's he taking it so far?

88
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,774
How do you think? He's thrilled, of course!

89
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,692
Do you think he really enjoys sleeping in a
different, random shrine every night with you?

90
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,284
Unlike this house, shrine grounds
and buildings are sacred territory.

91
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:35,045
Which means they keep US safe from phantom attacks.

92
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,738
Even so.

93
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:41,967
Haven't you ever heard that things go bump in
the night? That's the phantoms' favorite time.

94
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,656
Poor kid. I doubt he'll be able to handle it.

95
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:47,854
Huh?

96
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,283
The thing about him...

97
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,044
You see.

98
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,138
Is he's afraid of the dark.

99
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,031
Aw, man, I don't even know how long
it's been since I've had a hot bath.

100
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,351
What now?

101
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:12,016
I wonder what Yato'll do if I
decide not to go back to him.

102
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:16,757
Maybe he'll switch. Start using that girl instead.

103
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,691
But if he does, what happens to me?

104
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:27,011
Huh? Why do I feel like I know that smell?

105
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,520
Ah! Hold on, is it, is it because...

106
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,851
D-d-d-d-d-d-d...

107
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,831
Did Hiyori just take a bath in this water, too?

108
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:48,275
Ah! Here you are. I've been looking for you.

109
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:52,564
Hey, Hiyori! I found what I needed! Don't worry about it!

110
00:08:56,247 --> 00:09:01,376
Gotta train harder. Build stronger
quads. Gotta master the jungle.

111
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,646
You need something, Yukine?

112
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:13,316
I woke you up. I'm sorry.

113
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,613
It's okay. Is something wrong?

114
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:20,745
Well, um. It's going to sound stupid, but
your dad turned off the lights in my room.

115
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,494
And I, well, y'know. I don't like the dark much.

116
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,923
Oh... I get it.

117
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,035
Well, want to sleep with me?

118
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,729
Huh?

119
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,754
It's okay, see? Come on in.

120
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,177
Oh no I can't really--

121
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,135
hurry up already, it's getting cold.

122
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,318
B-b-b-b-but I!

123
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,121
Yeah, it's been a while since I slept with someone, too.

124
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,825
You don't smell like a boy. You smell nice.

125
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,119
I like this. Lying next to someone.

126
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,577
It's soothing.

127
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:03,176
It's kinda nice not to be alone at night, you know?

128
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,808
Young man, just what do you think you're doing?

129
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:47,118
You jerk! What are you doing here?

130
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:50,185
Don't give me that, you little
punk! What were you about to do?

131
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,577
No, I...

132
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,937
listen, Hiyori said I could be there!

133
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:59,388
You're not ready to have girls in your
life yet. So behave. For now, I'm all you need.

134
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,180
When you say stuff like that, it makes me wanna puke.

135
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,995
And anyway, you've got a girl. A
regalia like me, but she's a chick.

136
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,372
So what do you even need me for?

137
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,515
Gonna be another stormy night.

138
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:43,936
Closing in on downtown. Location reached.

139
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,280
Incoming: Six o'clock!

140
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:03,708
We're done here.

141
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:12,321
I'm glad you came. This is fun.

142
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,971
Didn't have anything else to do, so.

143
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,090
Those look nice. You want a pair?

144
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:19,941
Uhh...

145
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,950
It is getting colder outside.

146
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,824
Let's see how much I have.

147
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:26,565
No! It's okay. I don't need anything, I promise.

148
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,789
Oh, come on. I want to get them for you.

149
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:34,952
But I'm fine, really! I mean, it's not like anyone can see
me, right? So, if I want something, I can just borrow it.

150
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:49,893
Hey! You should know better than that!
What you're doing's no different than stealing!

151
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,316
What? I said I'm just borrowing it.

152
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:53,341
I'll give it right back.

153
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:56,461
Well, it's still wrong. Here, give it to me.

154
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,395
The next time you want something
like this, just tell me okay?

155
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:09,970
Where did he go?

156
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:11,367
Hey.

157
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,904
Yato? What are you doing here?

158
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,925
Getting a little r and r. I'm not feeling so good today.

159
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,648
You are looking after him like you said, aren't you?

160
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,188
'Cause it seems like he's been gettin' in trouble.

161
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,044
How could you possibly know that?

162
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,602
Like I said before.

163
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,359
Master and regalia share mind and body.

164
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:37,015
I feel it when Yukine gives in
to the temptation to behave badly.

165
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:41,067
That's just how things work
for US. We're closely connected.

166
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:46,953
In that case, is the opposite true? Did Yukine get stung
when you swiped some of my dad's drinks from the fridge?

167
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:51,833
No, it's not like that. The pain
only goes in one direction, you see.

168
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:56,320
From regalia to master, which actually
makes sense, if you think about it.

169
00:13:56,907 --> 00:14:02,788
After all, Regalias used to be people.
And people sin. Some more than others.

170
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:17,310
Resentment, fear, envy, desperation, sadness, greed.

171
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:23,055
Those emotions tempt Regalias to
do what they otherwise might not.

172
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:30,650
Acting on them brings pain. We gods feel that pain,
and from it we learn something of what it is to be human.

173
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:35,343
Listen, Hiyori. I think there are
some things I ought to clear up for you.

174
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,536
People decide what's right and wrong, but those
concepts don't apply to gods. To put it in simple terms,

175
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:49,717
gods get to do whatever they want. Even if
that includes hurting someone, or taking a life.

176
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:57,061
Someday, Yukine may need punishment. Divine punishment.

177
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,355
Yato.

178
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:07,087
But yatty did kill a regalia once.
He kills people, too, sometimes.

179
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:13,175
I-I have to go. I need to find Yukine!

180
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,562
Again? Of all the things to leave behind.

181
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,869
I screwed up. I wonder if she's still mad at me.

182
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,288
Crap! It's that late?

183
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:47,373
Damn it!

184
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,309
Hurry!

185
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,549
Faster! I hate the dark!

186
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,856
I'm scared.

187
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,924
It's dark.

188
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,061
I don't like the dark. Mommy. Please come and get me!

189
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,947
You stopped walking. You can see me?

190
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,171
Oh no.

191
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:26,480
You can see me! Everybody else out here just ignores me!

192
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:31,162
Well, these eyeball things try to
talk to me, but they're weird and scary.

193
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,468
This girl...

194
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:42,549
I'm waiting for my mommy, just like I'm supposed to.
She comes to pick me up after my tutoring session is over.

195
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,280
Oh, she does, huh?

196
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:49,153
She shouldn't be much longer.
Will you please wait here with me?

197
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,934
Just 'til six o'clock.

198
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:55,253
Sure.

199
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,073
Where is he?

200
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:11,352
I'm really sorry. I guess my mommy's running late.
Your family's probably worried about you, too, huh?

201
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:14,586
Family? I don't really have one of those.

202
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,860
Hey, I know! When my mommy gets here,
you can come home with US too, okay?

203
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:26,818
Don't worry. I'm sure she'll get here soon. Really.

204
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,655
No, she won't.

205
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,120
Hey! Come back here!

206
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:48,172
There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!

207
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,807
Wait, don't go that way!

208
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:50,610
Huh?

209
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,705
You must be so scared.

210
00:17:54,995 --> 00:18:05,844
Poor little girl... All lost and alone... in the dark.
But don't worry. It'll be okay. Your mommy is over here.

211
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,253
My mommy?

212
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:13,040
Come this way. Come to US.

213
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:16,364
Yukine! Use that thing Yato taught you!

214
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:19,248
First I have to make my hand into a halberd.

215
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,782
Damn!

216
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,048
Border!

217
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:35,073
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said your mom's not coming.

218
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,418
It's okay now. They'll stay
back. They can't cross that line.

219
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:44,459
Smells nice. Smells nice.

220
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:48,107
Smells nice. Smells nice.

221
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,998
Smells nice.

222
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:56,174
I just noticed. You actually smell really nice.

223
00:18:56,199 --> 00:19:00,107
Smells nice. Come here.

224
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:04,248
You smell really nice. Want to smell more.

225
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,325
Yukine!

226
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:11,234
More smell, please. More. Can I have?

227
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,073
More smell, please...

228
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:44,084
Boy smells nice. Mommy? Where?

229
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:46,869
Yato!

230
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,779
Yukine, you all right?

231
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,901
That big phantom... A girl, went into it.

232
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:55,355
Boy smells nice!

233
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,587
Help her! You have to help her, Yato! Please help her!

234
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:03,836
Very well.

235
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,046
Come Sekki!

236
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:17,759
This is the land of the rising sun. Your desecration
shall not be allowed. Hear me. I am the god Yato.

237
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,591
I now lay thee waste with the Sekki and
expel thy vast defilement. I cleanse thee.

238
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,274
No! Yato!

239
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:34,310
Stop!

240
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:35,560
Rend!

241
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:45,606
What the hell are you doing?
You were supposed to save her!

242
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,045
It's too late for that. Can't you
see? She's been completely possessed!

243
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,129
What are you saying?

244
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,416
Killing her is the only choice we have now.

245
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,452
Yukine.

246
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:11,654
Once it has been corrupted and
consumed by a phantom, a soul is utterly lost.

247
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,374
Its existence
can be nothing but a living hell!

248
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,951
You must do this. Show her mercy and free her!

249
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,904
Yukine!

250
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,461
Rend!

251
00:22:05,077 --> 00:22:08,188
We've received word from
Kuraha, who's patrolling the city.

252
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:12,377
It seems that he saw Yato, slaying a phantom.

253
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,491
He appears to have obtained a new regalia.

254
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:18,598
I see.

255
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:00,719
How was your bath, Yukine? Nice and relaxing?

256
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:04,994
Yeah. Oh, and I used some shampoo. I think it was
Rose-scented or something.

257
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,465
I'm guessing it was yours, right?

258
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,568
Actually, it's my dad's hair-growth cream.

259
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:09,702
Your dad's?

260
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,430
Next time on noragami: "Scary person."
