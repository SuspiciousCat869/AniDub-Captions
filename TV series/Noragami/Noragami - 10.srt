1
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:09,629
Yukine. Tend to the shop once you're done in there.

2
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:10,789
'Kay!

3
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:20,861
Nice.

4
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,615
The oden's ready now.

5
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,790
Great. Glad to see you're off to such a good start.

6
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:28,132
Hey! Good morning, you two.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,249
Hey! Good to see you!

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,146
So you really did pick up a part-time job here, huh?

9
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,863
Well, it's just.

10
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,630
I need to. I wanna pay back the money I took, y'know?

11
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:40,678
Aw, Yukine.

12
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:44,627
I may be made out of stone, but even
I coundn't say no when he told me that.

13
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:49,579
You were on the wrong path, but it looks
like you've finally straightened yourself out.

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,449
Uh. Yeah, that is part of it. But it's also
because Yato doesn't ever make any damn money!

15
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,128
Oh, yeah. Don't you have a
favor you were gonna ask Hiyori?

16
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:01,856
I said that wasn't a big deal!

17
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,727
What is it?

18
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:04,572
Um, well, uh.

19
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,232
You're getting set to move onto a new grade, right?

20
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:11,991
He was hoping you wouldn't mind passing your old
textbooks on to him if you still have them around.

21
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,462
He wants to start acting like a normal kid again.

22
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,487
It's cool if you don't want to...

23
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,532
Of course I don't mind! You can have them all!

24
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:23,560
Huh?

25
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:26,321
What is wrong with you guys lately?

26
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:29,309
Oh, there you are! I've been looking for you two.

27
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:32,868
Just so you don't forget. You owe me money, too.

28
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:38,714
Oh, c'mon, Yori. Don't tell me you already
forgot that you asked us to save Yatty for you.

29
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,315
Cuz we did the work. And this is how much we charge.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,425
Five yen? I can do that.

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,532
5 million, and we did help you twice.

32
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:53,463
Ten million?

33
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:59,006
Oh, don't you worry. A girl as
cute and smart and capable as you are.

34
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,463
I'm sure you can earn that amount it in no time at all.

35
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,895
Wait, Kofuku. Hiyori's still in
school. What about the student discount?

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,101
Oh, good point. So. We'll call it one million.

37
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:12,987
Good deal! 90 percent off! That is one serious bargain!

38
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,872
And this is why it pays to do
business with the god of poverty.

39
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,267
You still haven't even fixed my body
yet! And now you've put me in debt?

40
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:26,365
You will help me pay this off!

41
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:29,535
Man, what fighting federation does she belong to?

42
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,012
Tenjin!

43
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:05,686
I wanted to drop by and say thanks for your help!

44
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:09,572
I heard you really let yourself
get put through the ringer.

45
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,501
Yeah, I guess so.

46
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:15,603
What, you guess so? How could you ever
let your blight get that out of control?

47
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,069
Your Regalia had you on the verge of death.

48
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:22,775
Well, the Sekki has incredible potential. I
couldn't just throw away his talent like that.

49
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,136
And besides that, I wanted to reforge him properly.

50
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:30,696
I intentionally let my condition get that
bad. just to give him a stern wake-up call.

51
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:33,587
Well. I suppose I understand your method.

52
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:40,920
Yeah, but regardless. You guys really saved my butt,
especially you, Tomone. I guess we're still friends.

53
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,718
That's Mayu for you. She is a gutsy, dependable girl.

54
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,324
All thanks to a certain lowlife who took her in.

55
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,222
Well, I am one hell of a teacher.

56
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:53,652
Oh, yes, and your method follows the four Cs, I believe.

57
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:56,257
Are they friends now?

58
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,829
I can't tell.

59
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,714
Come, come. Why don't we talk somewhere else?

60
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:06,268
Hey. Aren't you missing one of the
Regalias? I think her name was Miyu?

61
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,544
Unfortunately. She was kicked
out for stinging Lord Michizane.

62
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,633
She was corrupted?

63
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:21,983
You see. What happened to you,
Yukine, is actually very contagious.

64
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,620
Just seeing or hearing about it can affect others.

65
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,418
A single sting to a master results in banishment.

66
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:39,592
Lord Michazane has never once
made an exception to this rule.

67
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:46,744
To harm others or yourself, whether intentionally
or not, is to betray the master who named you.

68
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:51,845
Banishment is actually seen as an
act of generosity after an ablution.

69
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:58,169
Because a new master might take you
in. If you're lucky that is. Otherwise.

70
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,817
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

71
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:10,809
It simply couldn't be helped. But please. You mustn't
let this bother you, no matter how upsetting it may be.

72
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,660
It might have an effect on Yato.

73
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:17,480
Believe me when I tell you this,
Yukine. We understand how you felt.

74
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,446
Regalias are easily corrupted if
they don't maintain their borderlines.

75
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:29,332
Ultimately, we're still Far Shore
beings who dwell alongside Phantoms.

76
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:33,479
You must be careful. The darkness is always with you.

77
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,552
The darkness.

78
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:39,435
Despite everything, Yato refused to banish you.

79
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,672
And now it's your turn. Swear on
your name. to always protect him.

80
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,907
Of course. I swear on my name: Yuki.

81
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,942
What's funny?

82
00:06:55,932 --> 00:07:00,157
By the way, Tenjin. I could use
some advice if you've got it to give.

83
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,444
Hmm?

84
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,636
It actually has to do with Hiyori.

85
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:08,229
Ya see, after her accident, she kinda
slips in and out of her spirit form.

86
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:08,978
Oh.

87
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:12,336
The thing is, I accepted her
request to fix it; Which would be fine.

88
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:16,570
If I knew what in the hell to do!
But I've just kept on putting it off.

89
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,932
I've gotta do it, though. She's
helped me out several times now.

90
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,703
So it's only right! Now's the
time to finally tackle her job!

91
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:26,535
It's remarkable how much of a lost cause you are.

92
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:30,616
Have you considered maybe cutting her ties with you?

93
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,189
Huh?

94
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:35,074
It's just a guess, but doing so
might actually fix her condition.

95
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,101
Wait, cut her ties?

96
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:43,436
It seems to me that the connection between
you grants her too much of a focus on our world.

97
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:47,865
Try cutting that connection as a
test. Shouldn't be hard for you.

98
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,314
Studying at the library's so
much better than studying at home.

99
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,385
No kidding.

100
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,551
Another day of solid studying! I'm feeling good!

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,445
It can only do so much with the exams we've got
coming. We really need to pick a shrine to pray at.

102
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,195
Yeah! We've gotta pray to a god!

103
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,513
I wish to graduate and be popular and be
healthy and be popular and for my family to be safe!

104
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,425
You wished to be popular twice.

105
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,715
Well, it's that important.

106
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,549
That sure is a lot of wishes. Don't burden the gods.

107
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,594
Isn't it pretty much the gods'
job to hear people's wishes, though?

108
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,922
I mean, why should I care about their schedules?

109
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,122
Right.

110
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:26,860
Oh, yeah. Speaking of wishes. There's one
god people have been talking about lately.

111
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,330
Oh, yeah, I know.

112
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:29,482
Wait, which god?

113
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:36,212
They say that if you tell him the name of someone you
want gone, he'll actually make them disappear for you.

114
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,795
"Lord Rabo, Lord Rabo.

115
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,321
I humbly beg of you!" That's it, right?

116
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,526
That's how it goes.

117
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,949
His name's Rabo?

118
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,378
That's the first I've ever heard of that god.

119
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,411
It's just a dumb fad.

120
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:48,819
Exactly.

121
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,617
What's with the school books, Hiyori?

122
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:53,186
Yeah, those are our old ones.

123
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:55,047
What are you luggin' those around for?

124
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,234
I'm giving them to a friend of mine.

125
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,824
What's up, kids! You workin' hard in here?

126
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,775
Daikoku! I'll take one of those snacks!

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,705
What the hell are you doing in our home?

128
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,517
Oh, c'mon, man. Don't be so cold.

129
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:16,287
This room is for Yukine! Not your lazy ass! Go
suck on some tea leaves if you're hungry! Jeez.

130
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,992
It's still not right. Do it again.

131
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,628
Hiyori. You're kind of strict.

132
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:27,054
It's easy to mess up this part
and this part. Try to stay focused.

133
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:28,412
Okay.

134
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:33,119
Hold on! Let me see. The real trick to
learning. You've gotta draw the stuff!

135
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:37,955
There! The Pillow Book's Sei Shonagon. Hojoki's
Kamo-no-Chomei. and Tsurezuregusa's Yoshida Kenko.

136
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:40,687
You're good!

137
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:46,389
I know, it's impressive. It took work.
But with as long as I've been a god, it ju...

138
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:47,543
Don't ruin my stuff!

139
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,579
I didn't ruin it! I graced it with my talent!

140
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,738
Why don't you use that talent to earn some money
for a change! Why have you always gotta butt in, huh?

141
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,516
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:58,886
What's wrong?

143
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,032
Uh. Nothing. Don't worry about it.

144
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,361
Hiyori! Could you add the black beans to these for me?

145
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,185
Okay!

146
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,811
...has yet to be found. Despite having
taken place in plain sight of others, no...

147
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:12,115
There've been a lot of stories
about this slasher on the news lately.

148
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,490
I know it's New Year's but...
I wish you'd stay home tonight.

149
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:19,098
It's just a shrine visit. And
I'll have Yama and Ami with me.

150
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,124
I still can't help but worry.

151
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,059
I can't believe you took a dumb job
like this on New Year's Eve of all nights.

152
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:40,811
Hey, you gotta take the work when the work comes.
And end-of-year cleaning can be pretty lucrative.

153
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:41,871
But I've gotta ask.

154
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,309
Does a dog really need its own mansion?

155
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:46,732
I know, it's huge! Right?

156
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:49,721
No way! It's even got a heated floor!

157
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:50,838
Are you serious?

158
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:53,618
I am so freakin' jealous!

159
00:10:54,667 --> 00:11:00,925
Hello! You have successfully reached
Delivery God Yato. Available 365 days a year.

160
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,905
Yato.

161
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,152
Oh, Hiyori! Hey, what's going on with ya? Hm?

162
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:11,142
Well uh. Do you wanna come to the Tenjin
shrine tonight for the first visit of the new year?

163
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:11,885
Huh?

164
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,953
Why d'you wanna visit that geezer? You can't think
of another god to visit tonight? I'm kind of insulted.

165
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,828
Well, I've got my exams coming up.

166
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,752
And you don't even have a shrine to visit.

167
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:24,569
Guess I'll have to use your wages to buy one!

168
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,019
Are you a god or a pimp?

169
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:30,752
You don't have to visit the shrine.
There'll be food stalls there too.

170
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:31,624
Food stalls?

171
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,490
We're in!

172
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,887
Oh, man, I want some candied fruit!

173
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,380
I'll see you guys soon.

174
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,452
All-out, huh?

175
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:52,228
Hmmm.

176
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:01,912
Now make sure you don't run in this. You
don't want it to come loose and fall off of you.

177
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:02,797
I know.

178
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:04,712
Let's see you.

179
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,973
Oh, you look lovely.

180
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,276
Well, I better go.

181
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:22,614
Huh.

182
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:30,286
So that's the half-Phantom deluding Yato.

183
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,338
That's her.

184
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,919
Let's slay her. Reiki.

185
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,158
Not yet.

186
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:36,517
And why not?

187
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,783
It would be wasteful. She can still be of use to us.

188
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:49,950
Hiyori!

189
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,304
You got all dressed up for new year.

190
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,203
Yeah! You said "all out"!

191
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:57,444
We are going all out! I'm
offering a ton of money this year!

192
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:01,773
We've got the test and a new
school to worry about, and popularity!

193
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:07,024
Simmer down, dummy. I think it's pretty safe to
say the whole class will move on to the next grade.

194
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:09,325
Hiyori's playin' it safe with that outfit.

195
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:11,030
That's not why I'm wearing it!

196
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,223
So... I uh...

197
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,449
I wanted to let you guys know that
someone might join us later. If that's cool.

198
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:20,540
What? Is it a guy? Is that why you're dressed up?

199
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,365
Hm!

200
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,295
So you're scheming to win his heart by
convincing him you're a different person this year?

201
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,949
Huh, no! I swear it's not like that!

202
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:31,422
You've got some serious ambition for
the new year. Full blast out of the gate.

203
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,751
Honestly, I'm telling you, it's not like that!

204
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:34,872
Jeez!

205
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,174
Just drop it already!

206
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,692
Popularity, popularity,
popularity, popularity, please gimme popularity.

207
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:46,558
Please, please,
please, I just wanna be popular!

208
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,369
Please let me move onto without trouble.

209
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,891
I used to visit shrines just 'cuz I was supposed to,

210
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:58,681
but now, please let me continue
to have fun with all my new friends.

211
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:02,704
I want some octopus dumplings.

212
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:03,854
They look tasty!

213
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,676
Hey, Hiyori. You gonna buy some?

214
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:08,540
Oh... Mm-hm.

215
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,326
Yato! Wait up!

216
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,326
Hm?

217
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,630
Hiyori! Hey, Hiyori! Wake up!

218
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,589
Her first narcoleptic fit of the year.

219
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,226
Aw, man.

220
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,003
I can't believe we missed ringing in
the new year just to clean a dog mansion.

221
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:35,936
You have no work ethic! If I get hired to
clean, I'm not leaving until the job is done!

222
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,859
I just hope Hiyori hasn't gotten sick of waiting.

223
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,336
A text? Yeah, it's for another Phantom-slaying job.

224
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:49,828
Hey, wait, according to the message.
It says to show up right around here.

225
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,200
Come! Sekki!

226
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:19,968
This is the land of the Rising Sun.
Your desecration shall not be allowed.

227
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:29,932
Hear me. I am the god Yato. I now lay thee waste with
the Sekki. And expel thy vast defilement! I cleanse thee!

228
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:32,734
Rend!

229
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,559
Alright. Nicely done, kid.

230
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:46,850
Hey, thanks.

231
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,677
Huh? We've gotta fight that many?

232
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,172
Stay calm, Yukine. We've got this.

233
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:09,707
Listen to me. You've really grown a lot,
and you're only gonna keep growing stronger.

234
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,651
You've gotta believe in yourself!

235
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:27,731
Let me see, Yato. Show me the power of this Regalia.

236
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,226
Display his true worth to you.

237
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:34,660
Yato?

238
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:36,494
Are you here?

239
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,453
I'm not picking up his scent around here.

240
00:16:59,233 --> 00:16:59,941
Nora.

241
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,394
Um. Hi, Nora.

242
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,456
Hey, have you seen Yato? I thought
I saw him come this way, but...

243
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:11,976
What's that? Is it-

244
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:16,812
I would appreciate it if you wouldn't speak to
me in such a casual manner, you lowly Phantom.

245
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:19,309
Huh?

246
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,796
Whoa, when did I?

247
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,894
The ablution. I know you played
a large part in the ritual.

248
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:27,808
You were watching?

249
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:33,846
That was the perfect chance to
revoke his name. And you squandered it.

250
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:34,817
Huh?

251
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,683
You're quite fast on your feet, I see.

252
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:57,982
Go after her Cord. But please
try not to accidentally bite it off.

253
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,153
Why are you attacking me?

254
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,107
You want to know why?

255
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:19,680
Frankly, because I don't like you.

256
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:24,677
It's like there's no end to these things!

257
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,911
Yeah, they're persistent to say the least!

258
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,163
They vanished.

259
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,308
How disappointing.

260
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,186
I suppose that's it for my masked ones.

261
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,904
Were you afraid?

262
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:26,575
Something even more frightening is about to happen.

263
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,187
Huh?

264
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:31,684
A god of calamity known as Rabo has awoken.

265
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:33,832
Rabo?

266
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:38,930
"Lord Rabo, Lord Rabo. I humbly beg of you!"

267
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:47,853
What about him? If someone wishes for it, Rabo can easily
dispatch the life of a Phantom. Or the life of a person.

268
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,219
Or the life of a god.

269
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:59,460
A blood-soaked, aberrant god of calamity from the
Far Shore... Rabo has come, and he intends to kill Yato.

270
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:12,807
No... But... ...But Yato has Yukine with him.
Yato has grown weak from his time spent with you.

271
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:19,513
If you care about Yato. Then please. Stop existing.

272
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:24,349
C'mon, come get me!

273
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,505
Alright. You've got 'em all rounded up.

274
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:36,076
That's right. Now show me the power
of your ragged heart. Let your rage out.

275
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,141
The same rage that drove you to break
those school windows and hurt all you touched!

276
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,846
Fine! Okay! Shut up!

277
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:48,885
Harness that rage and we'll take 'em out! This is the land
of the Rising Sun. Your desecration shall not be allowed.

278
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,509
Hear me. I am the god Yato. I now lay thee
waste with the Sekki. And expel thy vast defilement!

279
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,051
I cleanse thee!

280
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:00,767
Rend!

281
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,650
And that's all there is to it. Well done.

282
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:21,966
Now let's go find Hiyori!

283
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,847
Yeah! I can't wait!

284
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:28,714
Candied fruit! Candied fruit! I'm gonna
buy candied fruit with Hiyori's money...

285
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,681
what the? Don't you owe her enough?

286
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:36,209
That's it?

287
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,750
That's Yato's strength now?

288
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,752
That's what he's become?

289
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:45,928
Please don't pass out while walking home, alright?

290
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:47,255
I'll be okay.

291
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,751
Hiyori!

292
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,492
Hey, happy new year, sorry we're so late.

293
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,265
Happy New Year!

294
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,158
Whoa, hold on. You're not goin' home, are ya?
C'mon, the food stalls are still open, let's go!

295
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:02,646
It'll be the first food offering of the year!

296
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,370
Unless. You'd rather make your first money offering.

297
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:07,907
Uh...

298
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,051
Huh?

299
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:13,664
I um.

300
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,230
Somethin' wrong, Hiyori?

301
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,900
Do we know each other?

302
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:20,719
Who are you?

303
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:02,134
What's wrong, Veena? Have you caught a cold-

304
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,397
Actually, it looks like I'm not
the only one sneezing here, Kazuma.

305
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:09,495
Next time, on Noragami: "Abandoned
