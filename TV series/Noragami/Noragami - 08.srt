1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,732
If that doesn't happen very soon.

2
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:08,581
Then Yato will die.

3
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:10,948
So Yato was right.

4
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:12,569
You did steal it.

5
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:16,176
Why is he even using such a Regalia?

6
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:20,819
Sekki! I will re-forge you!

7
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,573
It'll be okay, though...

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,320
Won't it?

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,005
Ow.

10
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,857
Well, how 'bout that? Hello, there!

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,806
Wait! I'm not spying on you, I swear!

12
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,065
Seriously. He's telling the truth.

13
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,982
Now, would you like to explain why you're here?

14
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,982
It's for work. I was trying to tell you.

15
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:28,998
By the way, what part of the job
includes graffiti-ing the girls' bathroom?

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,815
You see, young one. I long for the
worship of all people, regardless of age.

17
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:39,808
Thus, I must be prepared to enter even a high
school bathroom if that's where the request leads.

18
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:42,648
I'm not buying it! What kind of client
would ask you to come here, you perv?

19
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,193
Allow me to introduce...

20
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,399
...our client!

21
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,113
I didn't mean to...

22
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:50,582
Don't hurt me!

23
00:02:55,648 --> 00:03:02,799
Sorry. Very sorry. But I'm not being dirty or anything,
though, honest. I just had to get away from those jerks.

24
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:04,701
It's true.

25
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:08,012
My name's Manabu Ogiwara. I'm in Class 2-A.

26
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:13,204
There are these guys in my class.
They mess with me whenever we have a break.

27
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:18,122
So I hid. I figured this was
one place they'd never find me.

28
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,903
I'm sorry! It was a stupid plan!

29
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:28,732
I had no idea. Now I'm sorry. I
should've let you explain all this, first.

30
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:32,073
Yeah, I had a feeling it was gonna be something like this.

31
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,700
That's usually the case when I get called out to a school.

32
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,857
You've seen this sort of thing before?

33
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,574
Bullying is real common.

34
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:43,148
And I happen to be just the type of
guy victims call when they want some help.

35
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,190
I can see why. They're desperate
enough to clutch at straws.

36
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:47,590
Or at gods.

37
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,478
What did I ever do to them?

38
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:56,200
I hate this stupid school so much.
I wish I could go anywhere else!

39
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:00,815
You're getting angry because you can see yourself in him.

40
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:06,386
I get it, really. It's not fair. But
being pissed at him won't help anything.

41
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,405
Don't give me that! What the hell do you know about me?

42
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:17,328
I'm nothing like that whiny loser! And I'm sick and
tired of tagging along on these useless jobs of yours!

43
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,984
Wait! Don't go!

44
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,685
Not exactly a sweet-tempered kinda kid, huh?

45
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,788
You could learn from him.

46
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,606
In your case, it might actually be
helpful to let it all out like that.

47
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:32,618
Huh?

48
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,610
Here. You can use this.

49
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,190
I-I don't.

50
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:41,190
Remember this.

51
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:42,857
If you decide to fight.

52
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:54,732
I can't believe you gave him that! I
hope you have some kind of plan in mind!

53
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,782
Just adding some fuel to the fire.

54
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:00,122
I want Manabu to try defending himself for once.

55
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,607
How he chooses to do that is up to him.

56
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,940
I guess so, but couldn't you and Yukine handle it somehow?

57
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,232
By severing his ties to the bullies, maybe?

58
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,207
What's the matter?

59
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:15,873
You know...

60
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,897
...you did just give me a beating.

61
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,413
I think I'll... go lie down.

62
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,423
Was this a bad idea?

63
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,679
Being here could push Yukine too far.

64
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,875
Maybe to his breaking point.

65
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:32,100
Huh?

66
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,917
Hold on a second! What do you mean "breaking point"?

67
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,943
So he thinks I'm like that other
kid? What a joke. I'm not even alive.

68
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,053
As long as I've got this, I can't go anywhere.

69
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:52,148
I'm stuck with the least popular god ever!

70
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,527
This really sucks!

71
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,729
"Day Duty" "The class field trip"

72
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:10,790
"This month's goals"

73
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,523
"Guidance counseling"

74
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:32,497
Everyone wears the same thing.
Is this how I used to dress?

75
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:36,382
All rise.

76
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,390
Attention.

77
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:40,042
Bow.

78
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:42,121
Be seated.

79
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:53,113
I solved it!

80
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,732
So what do we have next?

81
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,193
Uh... Language Arts.

82
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,565
Lemme see your homework!

83
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,487
Man, do you ever do yours?

84
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,623
My folks are really pissing me off.

85
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,091
They seriously want me to quit judo.

86
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,130
The big tournament's coming up, though.

87
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:16,715
Oh, man.

88
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,930
So many kids, and they're all my age.

89
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,608
I can't believe you brought that with you again.

90
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:29,773
You know they're gonna take it up.

91
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,648
Don't be a narc.

92
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,507
That's it! Get 'im good!

93
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:36,991
Get him!

94
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,014
Awesome!

95
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,682
When did you level up, dude?

96
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,398
Sweet, huh? I had my brother help me.

97
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:44,064
Hey!

98
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:46,153
Can we all come to your house today?

99
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:48,264
Well... I dunno. I'm busy.

100
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:50,314
C'mon! We're your friends!

101
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:53,287
Friends, huh?

102
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,065
That must be nice.

103
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,095
They're so lucky.

104
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,607
It's those jerks again.

105
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,148
Why do they hate me so much?

106
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,098
Why am I so alone?

107
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,304
Why, dammit?

108
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,565
Let their bodies hit the floor.

109
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:38,273
If you don't like them you should kill
them, or else you could just die instead.

110
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,857
Say goodbye to the cruel, cruel world!

111
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:58,281
What makes a garden grow, grow, grow?

112
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,216
Great. These are bruised, too.

113
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,554
I keep telling her to be careful, but does she listen?

114
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:05,494
Hm?

115
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,387
Yeah?

116
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,411
Bishamon?

117
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:15,617
I mean, Lady?

118
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,429
Bisha!

119
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:25,484
Yay! Bisha's here! Bisha's here!

120
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,133
So, why are you here? And so heavily armed, too?

121
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,053
Sorry, I'm being rude.

122
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:32,796
Kura.

123
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:34,388
Aki.

124
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,693
Kinu.

125
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:36,860
Tsugu.

126
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:37,984
Kazu.

127
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,648
I'm Kuraha.

128
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:42,648
My name's Akiha.

129
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:43,565
Hi, I'm Kinuha.

130
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:44,648
I'm Tsuguha.

131
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:45,706
And I'm Kazuma.

132
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,488
There you go. You've met all my weapons.

133
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,023
Good afternoon.

134
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,815
We've come today in hopes of getting an augury.

135
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,557
We dealt with the Phantoms that escaped
the Vent, but we'd like to take precautions.

136
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,486
Will you help?

137
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:04,197
In this area here, and... let me think.

138
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:07,281
I don't get it. What're they doing? What's an augury?

139
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,379
Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting you're
still new here so there are things you don't know.

140
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:17,048
Every once in a while, our lady comes here to
consult Lady Kofuku about where more Vents will open.

141
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,565
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe...

142
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:23,190
Vents almost always open at
locations she divines like this.

143
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,773
Of course, one could always argue that
they open because she points them out.

144
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,940
Now, now, that's not kind to say.

145
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,023
Vents are tricky.

146
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,631
They open when you least expect
'em, but doing this can help a bit.

147
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,846
It's not surefire, but it's the
best thing we've got right now.

148
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:38,648
Another one?

149
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:39,834
There are a lot.

150
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,415
Your work's not over yet, Bisha.

151
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,531
It looks like you've still got
a lot of Phantom hunting to do!

152
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,047
So it seems.

153
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:50,616
Lady Kofuku, I didn't realize
that you and Yato were acquaintances.

154
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:52,435
Do you see him often?

155
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:55,898
Once in a while, sure.

156
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:00,773
These Vents... You wouldn't be
opening them intentionally, would you?

157
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:04,489
As a means of keeping me busy,
and thus away from Yato, perhaps?

158
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,023
Now you're just being silly, Bisha!

159
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:08,691
No...

160
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:12,244
Despite what you might think about
my lady, not even she would do that.

161
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,881
I assume you're aware of my history with Yato.

162
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:15,490
Yep!

163
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,695
Of course, it's not really any of my business.

164
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,572
Still, if something were to happen to Yatty.

165
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,509
Well, then, there'd be a Storm.

166
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:36,753
I should be going.

167
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,813
My Lady Kofuku! What?

168
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:46,127
Threatening the Bishamon like that! And I
thought I couldn't fall for you any harder!

169
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:51,277
That was fun.
I have a feeling the worst of it's not over yet, though.

170
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,823
You think those two are going to keep fighting, then?

171
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,652
That's not what I'm worried about now.

172
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,601
Yatty was blighted, remember?

173
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,897
I wonder how he's doing.

174
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:14,985
No answer.

175
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,989
He should still be at the school

176
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,153
It's strange, though.

177
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,050
I can't smell him.

178
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,022
I wonder what's going on.

179
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,994
He seemed really worn down, too.

180
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,669
Hello? Is there anybody in here?

181
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,563
A-ha! I found you!

182
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:47,068
If left untreated, the pain will intensify.

183
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,441
The blight will spread throughout the body.

184
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,224
Hello.

185
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,940
I know what you're thinking! Don't get any dirty ideas!

186
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:05,107
It was innocent. I was just
checking something, that's all!

187
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,885
You know you're crazy, right?

188
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,495
So, Yukine still hasn't shown back up?

189
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,481
To be near me? No.

190
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:21,581
He's at an age that can be difficult and
dangerous for anyone. And Yukine is stuck there.

191
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,186
Who knows what he's up to?

192
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,482
A Storm's brewing.

193
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,667
So which tortured youth does it belong to?

194
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,727
Manabu, I think.

195
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,516
I know, right? It was my idea.

196
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
That's awesome!

197
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:41,619
Did you see the look on his face?

198
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,565
Or maybe not.

199
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:58,712
Later, man.

200
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:05,864
Oh, it is you. I thought I got a whiff of garbage.

201
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,415
What's your problem?

202
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,273
You got something to say to me?

203
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,323
Really, dude. You're actin' kinda freaky.

204
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,434
You should kill him.

205
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,273
Kill him now.

206
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:23,048
Kill him now.

207
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:28,072
Come on.

208
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,722
We were havin' some fun, is
all. I mean, can't you take a joke?

209
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,279
Having some fun?

210
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,308
That was fun?

211
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:49,307
Remember this. If you decide to fight...

212
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,975
It's only fair to arm your opponent, too.

213
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,103
You're messin' with me, right?

214
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,755
Cut him now.

215
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,523
Cut him deep.

216
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:13,671
Cut him deep now, and you'll be free for good.

217
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,412
Cross over the line, now.

218
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,814
Over the line.

219
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:29,607
Cross over the line. It'll feel so good.

220
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,315
Hurry.

221
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:31,357
Cross it.

222
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,565
Cross.

223
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:36,535
Cross it.

224
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,315
Cross.

225
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:38,281
Cross it.

226
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:39,939
Cross over the...

227
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,093
The line.

228
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:43,746
Cross over.

229
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:44,799
The line.

230
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:46,594
Cross the line.

231
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:50,250
It will feel so good.

232
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:54,414
It will set you free from them all!

233
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,780
All it'll cost is your humanity.

234
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:17,940
Manabu!

235
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,895
Are you okay?

236
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:21,801
Wow.

237
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,318
That's some impressive self-restraint.

238
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,481
I like to be prepared.

239
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:30,365
If things'd gone south, I had purification water ready.

240
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,627
I remembered what you said.

241
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:35,732
That's how I held back.

242
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,568
I couldn't use that thing to hurt someone.

243
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,555
I really wouldn't belong anywhere if I did that,

244
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,974
'cause I wouldn't be human anymore.

245
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:48,185
It's up to me.

246
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:51,282
Whatever they do, I have to stay strong.

247
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,452
You did a good job.

248
00:16:57,603 --> 00:17:01,631
Well, I guess they'll go back to just ignoring me.

249
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:06,085
Man, I tell ya. Kids these days.

250
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:09,731
They think life's a competition to
see who can make the most friends.

251
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:13,957
Really, one is enough.

252
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,273
Find that one unique person and you're all set.

253
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:25,699
Do you think he'll be all right?

254
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:29,301
I mean, can you be sure those jerks
won't try to get back at him for today?

255
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:33,182
Didn't you see? The other kid peed
his pants. He won't be telling anyone.

256
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:37,468
I hope things work out and he
finds a good friend, like you said.

257
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,440
I think he's gonna find what he needs soon,

258
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,179
which is something I'd like to do.

259
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:45,613
Huh?

260
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,482
Find somebody who's completely...

261
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:53,857
...unique.

262
00:17:59,381 --> 00:17:59,958
Why.

263
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,766
Why?

264
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:06,129
Why is this all that I get?

265
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:14,802
Come back!

266
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:20,779
Why are you leaving me behind?

267
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,361
Can't you just take me with you?

268
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:25,325
Please!

269
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:27,111
So, then.

270
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,304
Figured it out at last.

271
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:31,984
You can't go back over to that side.

272
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,156
This is your existence.

273
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,995
You'll never belong where you used to anymore.

274
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:38,732
Why are you ignoring me?

275
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:39,392
Hey!

276
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,123
Hey!

277
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,536
Hey!

278
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:49,988
Now you can finally see what it is you really want,
but you also know that it can never be yours again.

279
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,191
But don't do it, Yukine.

280
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:54,284
No matter how you feel.

281
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,277
Damn it.

282
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,672
You can't, okay?

283
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,075
You can't cross that line!

284
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:03,710
Damn it.

285
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:05,648
Damn it.

286
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:17,200
Poor, lonely little boy.

287
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,026
A crash? What was that?

288
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:27,334
Yato!

289
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,357
Everyone! Get down!

290
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,065
Hurry!

291
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,204
What's wrong with you?

292
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:56,898
Oh no!

293
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,708
The blight. It's spreading everywhere!

294
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,232
Yato!

295
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,154
Say something! Please!

296
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,863
What now? What should I do?

297
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,107
If anything happens to me...

298
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,031
I want you to go straight to those two.

299
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:30,360
This is how the blight feels?

300
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,944
And he's been enduring it for all this time?

301
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,911
Feel better?

302
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:56,910
Hey what happened to him?

303
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,732
You happened to him, Yukine.

304
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:00,196
Huh?

305
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:03,291
Every time you do something bad, you hurt him.

306
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:05,715
He suffers the consequences for you.

307
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:10,472
He's in so much pain.

308
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:12,567
And has been, but he's endured it.

309
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:14,529
No!

310
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,423
But I...

311
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,203
I should've listened to him
and tried to get you to stop acting out.

312
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,995
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

313
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:33,269
What are you waiting for?

314
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,404
Don't snack too much! I'll have
dinner on the table soon enough.

315
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:42,720
'Kay!

316
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:46,680
Huh?

317
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:47,693
Hm?

318
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,451
We sure are popular today, huh?

319
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:53,334
Huh?

320
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:57,357
Help us!

321
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,032
Please! Yato needs you!

322
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:01,857
Ya...

323
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:03,598
Border!

324
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,923
A Borderline?

325
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,147
Take it down!

326
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:13,315
Please let us in!

327
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:14,586
Daikoku!

328
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:15,898
Kofuku!

329
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,815
Don't just stand there!

330
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:21,121
Can't you see?

331
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,315
Yato is going to die!

332
00:23:58,857 --> 00:23:59,789
When the east wind blows...

333
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,273
My lord, perhaps you could recite
a new poem every now and then.

334
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:04,131
Oh, Tsuyu.

335
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:05,898
The young are so impulsive!

336
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:08,351
Next time, on Noragami: "Name."

337
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:09,761
Well, my lord? The poem?

338
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:10,940
Yes, yes. Just a moment.

339
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,825
You can't rush divine inspiration.
