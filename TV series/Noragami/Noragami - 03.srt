1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,119
I seriously gotta wear this garbage?

2
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:04,762
Quit yer complainin'.

3
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:08,345
Here! Check it out! This one's kinda cool.

4
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:10,845
That's so lame.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,377
Fine, I'll wear it then!

6
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:21,487
I wonder why I still feel all this physical stuff.

7
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:34,631
It doesn't make sense,
considering how long I've been dead.

8
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,427
This looks like a good spot to eat.

9
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,323
Eat up.

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,678
Is this a joke?

11
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,720
Ya said you were hungry, now didn't ya?

12
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,917
So don't be a snob and eat your lunch.

13
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:23,637
You call this lunch?

14
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,095
You're my Regalia.

15
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm your master and what I say goes!

16
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:33,462
Your Regalia, huh?

17
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,371
Yup! And I deserve nothin' but
respect from you! Worship me!

18
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,613
You loyally serve your master's every demand!

19
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,155
You could at least serve us some tea, y'know!

20
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,803
With what stove and what tea, exactly?

21
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,053
This backtalk is not gonna fly!

22
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,845
I demand obedience!

23
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,262
You're ripping out my hair!

24
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,970
Get off me, you vicious little monster!

25
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:05,497
I never would've dreamed this is how a god
lives, drifting around town like some kind of bum,

26
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:09,639
sleeping out on the stone steps of
some old shrine just to avoid attention,

27
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,373
and digging through garbage
every day just to find some food.

28
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,303
That's your strategy?

29
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:21,796
Gotta advertise.

30
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,312
For jobs that never come?

31
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:33,039
Are you positive that you're a real god?

32
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,721
That's rude. You doubt me?

33
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,459
All right, then. I'll show you what I can do.

34
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,258
Welcome. Good afternoon!

35
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:56,095
Hiyori's offered to buy us some grub
all because she appreciates my services.

36
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:57,762
This feels like extortion to me.

37
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:01,926
After you eat, I expect you to
finally take my request seriously.

38
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,220
Hey! Good afternoon.

39
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,637
Can I get you anything to drink?

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,012
Yeah, how 'bout two more glasses of water?

41
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:18,608
Huh?

42
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,884
Oh! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!

43
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:28,178
I thought you were invisible to other people,
considering that you're not human and all.

44
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:29,424
Not quite.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,303
We're not actually invisible.

46
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:34,637
We're just hard for people to notice, but they can see us.

47
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:37,773
Let me ask you this.

48
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:40,289
How many waitresses are working in here?

49
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,209
Huh?

50
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,736
Don't look, that's cheating.

51
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,095
Um, I guess...

52
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,204
Like, two?

53
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,137
Whoa, there's four of them?

54
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,678
And it's the same with us.

55
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:57,392
Yukine and I just kind of blend in with the
background, just like those other waitresses.

56
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:01,595
And if someone does notice us,
we look like normal, boring people.

57
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:03,720
They quickly forget they ever saw us.

58
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,727
I apologize again about that!

59
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,220
Think about it like this.

60
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,710
You don't remember every stranger
you've ever passed on the street, right?

61
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:19,079
Being from the Far Shore, we're like
the ultimate stranger, so it's stronger.

62
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,659
Well it's pretty noticeable how much food you eat.

63
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:34,066
Never let an offering go to waste!

64
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:36,854
An important rule!

65
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,470
You're gonna make yourself sick, you know.

66
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,928
Oh, I'll be fine, gods don't need to poop!

67
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:44,835
Thank you! Come again!

68
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,001
Jeez! He's really got some nerve!

69
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,844
So, uh, thanks for the food and all.

70
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,519
No problem.

71
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,595
I'm Hiyori Iki, by the way.

72
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,218
You can just call me Hiyori.

73
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,932
So how do you know him, Hiyori?

74
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:08,912
Um, well...

75
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:14,946
I kind of sometimes lose my body now,
so I'm hoping he can help me fix that.

76
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,102
Sucks to be you, huh?

77
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,543
I guess so.

78
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,553
Um, so what about you?

79
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:27,315
How did you, um...

80
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:32,832
Y'know, what'd you do before you were Yato's Regalia?

81
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,054
Well...

82
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:43,359
...I dunno. I mean, I do know that I died,
but I can only recall suddenly being in his hand.

83
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:45,470
And that's all I can remember.

84
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:50,410
Nothing from when I was alive, and I
don't know what to expect now, either.

85
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:55,289
Hey, you're that sardine thief from earlier.

86
00:06:57,637 --> 00:06:58,262
Good boy.

87
00:06:58,345 --> 00:06:59,345
He likes you.

88
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:00,762
Do you like cats?

89
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:01,997
It seems like it.

90
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:04,481
Well cats are really cute, huh?

91
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,624
I like them, too.

92
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,924
Yukine... You just had a rather
filthy thought, didn't you?

93
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,921
Listen up, kid, just so you know,
gods and Regalias share mind and body.

94
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,637
So as your master, you subject me
to every one of your pervy thoughts.

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,262
Keep our minds out of the gutter!

96
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:34,036
Huh? I don't even know what you're talking about.

97
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,845
Wait, what do you mean you share mind and body?

98
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,387
Man, you kids.

99
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,470
I know puberty's rough, but try to have a little control.

100
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:42,887
Shut your mouth, you idiot!

101
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,345
Hey, who do you think you're callin' an idiot?

102
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:49,206
This is not exactly how I pictured a
wish-granting god to act. Not at all.

103
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:55,442
Hello! Thanks for calling Delivery God
Yato. I'm fast, affordable, and I get results!

104
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,685
Yukine! We got a job! Let's go!

105
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,296
Someone hired you?

106
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,002
Wait! What about my job?

107
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,178
Hey, what the hell, who invited you along?

108
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:21,595
You wanna get rid of me?

109
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:23,470
Finish my job like you said you would!

110
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:24,357
A tail?

111
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:40,636
Who are you?

112
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,062
Did you call in a fake job just to set me up?

113
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:53,489
"When the east wind blows, spread
your fragrance, o plum blossoms."

114
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,576
Plum blossoms?

115
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,845
"Even without your master, do not forget the spring."

116
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,818
Wait, that's a Sugawara-no-Michizane poem.

117
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,769
Don't tell me that's...

118
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,262
...the god of learning!

119
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,582
Lord Tenjin!

120
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:08,628
Oh, my...

121
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,485
You've heard of me?

122
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:14,928
Oh, god!

123
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,053
Hey, cut it out!

124
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:18,553
I'm impressed you recognized the poem, little spirit.

125
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:20,178
It's a bit of a golden oldie.

126
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:21,678
It's in all the schoolbooks!

127
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,262
Well, that's distressing.

128
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,845
Don't you have copyright laws?

129
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,845
They expire 50 years after death.

130
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:27,833
Is that so?

131
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,553
So you're a real god.

132
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,095
Such an impressive aura!

133
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,053
Oh, you flatter me so.

134
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,095
He's the complete opposite.

135
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,944
Hmm? Tell me, Yato.

136
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:45,103
What's this little one called?

137
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,720
He's called Yuki.

138
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:51,523
As a Regalia, Sekki, and as a person, he's Yukine.

139
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:53,178
So, Yukine.

140
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:55,538
I take it you've only just become a Regalia.

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,303
As such, you need not prostrate yourself before me.

142
00:09:58,387 --> 00:09:58,757
Huh?

143
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:00,043
Tsuyu.

144
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,560
It's true.

145
00:10:05,803 --> 00:10:07,118
To put it simply...

146
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,720
...you already serve in the employ of one god.

147
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:13,430
And to bow before another, like
so, is to disrespect your master.

148
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,970
Please remember this rule.

149
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:16,946
Wow!

150
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,053
You've also got like an entire swarm of shrine maidens!

151
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,053
I'm Ayu!

152
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,095
I'm Nayu!

153
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:22,887
I'm Miyu!

154
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,075
I'm Moyu!

155
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,440
And together we are...

156
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:29,117
...the maidens of Lord Tenjin!

157
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,578
To be precise, each one of them serves as a Regalia to me.

158
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:36,512
It can be a task providing for all of them.

159
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,958
Real gods are on a whole different level!

160
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm a real god!

161
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,620
So what do you want?

162
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:51,220
Oh, right, I have my hands full with
requests, it being exam season and all.

163
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:54,467
So I was hoping you could dispatch some Phantoms for me.

164
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,933
I mean, it's not like you're busy.

165
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:01,766
And I am aware of the fact that you
sleep in my shrines without permission.

166
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,591
I know you've hit hard times, so I'm more
than happy to let you join my Tenman Group.

167
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:09,053
I could even make you a branch manager.

168
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:16,527
But of course, I assume you'd prefer to
have your own shrine. I can respect that.

169
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,678
Oh, I'm sorry, I seem to only have large bills.

170
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,637
Can you make some change?

171
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:29,834
Oh, how sad. Running a little low on funds, are we?

172
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:32,553
There's even a class division amongst gods?

173
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,016
That's gotta be why the world's so screwed up.

174
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:41,930
You had change the whole time?

175
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:45,295
Now then, I'll provide you with some guidance.

176
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:46,687
Makoto.

177
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,730
My Lord, Mayu is still new to these parts.

178
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,887
I would suggest another guide.

179
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:56,428
You do have a point.

180
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:57,637
This better not be fake.

181
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,688
But Mayu happens to know Yato.

182
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,053
Tomone?

183
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,470
I no longer go by Tomone.

184
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:13,595
It's Mayu now.

185
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:14,637
Tomone!

186
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,678
You... You joined this blowhard?

187
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,095
My name is Mayu.

188
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:20,470
You know each other?

189
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,637
You could say that.

190
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,887
There was a time when I was Yato's Regalia.

191
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,685
Oh, wow! You were, really?

192
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:28,345
How was it? I mean, working with him?

193
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,637
Did he actually follow through on his jobs?

194
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,262
And what about food and clothing?

195
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:35,742
Was he always a homeless, jobless, bum in a tracksuit?

196
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,678
Well he would never admit it, but he's actually
every last one of those things you mentioned.

197
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,595
Give your former master some credit here, Tomone!

198
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:45,970
It's Mayu, dammit!

199
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:48,553
Quit calling me by that name. It's disrespectful.

200
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:53,470
You complained nonstop about me putting my hands
on you and now you're some geezer's smoking pipe?

201
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:54,970
Money sure does change things!

202
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,345
I would have gladly teamed up with anyone but you!

203
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,262
Is she an ex-girlfriend?

204
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,241
No!

205
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:03,303
An ex-wife, then? You're on pretty bad terms.

206
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,095
It's nothing like that!

207
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,420
Well you sound like a bitter divorced couple.

208
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:10,637
Excuse me...

209
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:15,678
This job you need Yato for...

210
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,553
It's to kill Phantoms, right?

211
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:18,928
Are they really that bad?

212
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,394
I mean, do you have to permanently get rid of them?

213
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,720
Isn't there some other way you can deal with them?

214
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,887
"Disorder on Earth brings disorder to the heavens."

215
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,512
Hiyori, dear, to be honest with you, I can't say
that I approve of the existence of one such as you.

216
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,786
You could too easily complicate
matters without meaning to.

217
00:13:57,577 --> 00:14:02,578
A few days back, Lord Tenjin
received an unsettling wish plaque.

218
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:08,752
I chose to investigate it, and learned
that two students had taken their own lives.

219
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:11,033
Why would anybody do that?

220
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:13,803
This area is plagued by Storms.

221
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,661
The Phantoms they bring cling to
people, and then they take control of them.

222
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,510
Overcome with unbearable heartache,
Lord Michizane erected a barrier here.

223
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:30,595
Although, people can still carry deeply-rooted inner
demons through it, which hinders the act of purification.

224
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,977
Such an unfortunate waste.

225
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,778
A waste of precious life.

226
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,053
So then all we have to do is the defeat
the Phantoms that are possessing these people?

227
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,038
Yes!

228
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,220
Hiyori?

229
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,637
People are dying because of these Phantoms.

230
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,030
I can't just sit back and let that happen.

231
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:59,595
If someone wants to die, let 'em die.

232
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:00,395
Huh?

233
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:03,053
Spoken like the true scumbag you are.

234
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:09,338
Y'know, that's a pretty crappy attitude to take.

235
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:13,845
If a soul's willing to commit
suicide, that means it's been possessed.

236
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:15,595
It can't even become a Regalia.

237
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:17,720
Dead or alive, it still doesn't matter.

238
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:19,095
There's no saving it.

239
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:20,928
How can you even say that?

240
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,637
Isn't it your job to save people's souls?

241
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:40,822
Right. I'm out.

242
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,709
Not so fast! You've been paid!

243
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,769
Should we stop her? Or go after her, at least?

244
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:53,012
Man, why's he gotta be such a jerk?

245
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,095
Yukine...

246
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:57,285
It's time for your first job.

247
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,404
So what exactly do I have to do?

248
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:05,220
Come to me when I call for the
Regalia and revert when I call your name.

249
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,512
That's it for now.

250
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,285
Yato...

251
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:18,428
If someone wants to die, let 'em die.

252
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,134
That's disgusting. You're plain wrong!

253
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,917
Don't wanna get a job.

254
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:33,887
Don't wanna work, but don't wanna go to college, either.

255
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,264
Sushi Roll Kick!

256
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,470
You're gonna pay for the awful things you make people do!

257
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,520
Is us?

258
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,000
Like us?

259
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,095
One of us?

260
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,345
Your attention please.

261
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:56,345
A train will be passing Platform 1.

262
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:58,678
For your safety, please remain behind the yellow line.

263
00:16:58,762 --> 00:16:59,292
She should be with us.

264
00:16:59,316 --> 00:16:59,845
We need her with us.

265
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:00,905
Come with us.

266
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:01,720
This way.

267
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,054
Wait!

268
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:21,428
Jump to me!

269
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,034
You okay?

270
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:38,012
Man... Try to remember you'll die if your
tail gets cut. Now stay put for a moment.

271
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:44,075
Yukine... We're barreling
straight towards the real showdown.

272
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:55,969
I got an E on my practice exam.

273
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,416
Man, this sucks.

274
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:03,566
E. Z.? Take it easy!

275
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,431
Don't worry, come here and take it easy.

276
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,012
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

277
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,478
The answer is easy.

278
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,438
We're taking out that Phantom.

279
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:20,595
Don't wuss out now, all right?

280
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,514
Yeah, no problem.

281
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:29,649
Easy. Easy.

282
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,053
Oh, no! We're too late!

283
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,178
Relax!

284
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,012
Easy.

285
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,694
This is the land of the Rising Sun.

286
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,522
Your desecrations shall not be allowed.

287
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,137
Hear me. I am the god Yato.

288
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,298
I now lay thee waste with the
Sekki and expel thy vast defilement!

289
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,803
I cleanse thee!

290
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,487
Rend!

291
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:20,142
Yuki! Revert! That's enough! You cut too well!

292
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:51,727
You said that people who wanna
die should just go ahead and die.

293
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:54,303
But I guess you don't feel that way after all.

294
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,303
Hate to tell ya, but you're wrong.

295
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:59,428
I just refuse to let anyone die in front of these guys.

296
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:01,931
"These guys" who?

297
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,620
I know things can get painful.

298
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:08,146
But people should still
appreciate what it means to be alive.

299
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:17,992
If a soul's willing to commit suicide, that means
it's been possessed. It can't even become a Regalia.

300
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:19,988
The Regalias.

301
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,408
They're all so young and innocent.

302
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:29,637
And if none of them took their own lives,

303
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,972
then every one of them still wanted to keep on living.

304
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:42,683
Yato couldn't stand for the Regalias
to see these suicides waste their lives.

305
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:45,135
He wanted to protect them from that.

306
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,174
Hiyori?

307
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:00,803
You little perv!

308
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,303
Okay, what'd you do to her?

309
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,220
Nothing!

310
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,928
Hey! I'm okay!

311
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:13,345
I've just got some debris from
earlier in my eye, that's all!

312
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:15,970
Huh? That's not okay, it's dangerous!

313
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,137
Huh? No, don't rub them!

314
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,053
Easy!

315
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,012
Listen! Just stay calm!

316
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,622
Take deep breaths, okay?

317
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:22,742
How's that gonna help?

318
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,390
Use it.

319
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,381
It'll help warm ya up a little.

320
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:58,995
For your first job, I gotta say that ya
actually did pretty good out there today.

321
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,121
Huh?

322
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,095
Yukine, what's the difference
between butter and margarine?

323
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:02,762
