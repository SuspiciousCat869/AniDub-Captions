1
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,416
[YUMEMI] May I have
your attention, please?

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,708
It is my honor to welcome you
to the rooftop planetarium

3
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,541
of the Flowercrest
department store.

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,541
I'm your host.
My name's Hoshino Yumemi.

5
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,833
And I am proud to
serve on the staff.

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,125
Before we begin
the presentation,

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,083
I have a few important
announcements for you.

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,541
Please refrain from talking--

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,083
I've already heard this part
once, so you can skip it.

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,166
No! It's part of my job.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,833
I insist you allow me to make
the full announcement!

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,833
Okay, sorry. Do
whatever you want.

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,125
[YUMEMI]
Right. Thank you very much.

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,375
Please refrain from
talking or whispering

15
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,583
during the projection,

16
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,750
as this could annoy
your fellow customers.

17
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,875
We politely ask that you turn
off all cellular devices,

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,666
and silence your alarms.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,375
In addition, eating,
drinking, and smoking

20
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,583
are strictly prohibited for the
entirety of the demonstration.

21
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,250
Now, without further ado,

22
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,958
allow me to introduce the
true star of our show,

23
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,625
the one who makes this
presentation possible!

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,916
Let's welcome her with
a warm round of applause!

25
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,500
Our own Miss Jena!

26
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,333
To be perfectly honest,

27
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,166
while we have given
her a human name,

28
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,500
Miss Jena is what
we call this machine

29
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,625
which projects the night sky!

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:41,083
All that said, it's her big
moment, so I'll hand it over!

31
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,250
Say hello to the
audience, Miss Jena!

32
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:58,250
Now then, as of today,
2,487,290 visitors

33
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,041
have come to the
rooftop planetarium.

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,083
[YUMEMI] On behalf of
everyone here, I offer you

35
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,833
my most sincere gratitude.

36
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,958
To commemorate this
momentous occasion,

37
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,666
we have prepared a special
presentation for you!

38
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,916
Now sit back and enjoy
your viewing experience.

39
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,041
[YUMEMI]
It's a fine autumn evening,

40
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,958
though this little shower
might make it seem gloomy.

41
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,041
But have no fear if the rain
has got you down, my friends.

42
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,541
Put your mind at ease
and let me do the rest.

43
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,875
Because in the
Flowercrest planetarium,

44
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,333
we can bring out the
sun whenever we want!

45
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,041
See? There it is,
our friend, the sun!

46
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,291
It slowly sinks toward
the western horizon.

47
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,500
[YUMEMI] Suddenly, a new
celestial body appears.

48
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,166
The first to adorn
the sky each night.

49
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,541
Although sometimes
called the evening star,

50
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,625
it is actually none other
than the planet Venus!

51
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,666
As evening falls, the Heavens
grow steadily darker,

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,125
and more twinkling
orbs join the show.

53
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,291
Dusk fades to night, and the
dark blue firmament above

54
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,750
sparkles with wondrous beauty.

55
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,458
This is the sky as it appears
at 8 o'clock in the evening.

56
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:28,083
The dusty glow passing over
you is the Milky Way Galaxy,

57
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,708
named by men of antiquity

58
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,250
who imagined milk
flowing above them.

59
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,541
Now, turn your attention
to the highest star,

60
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,875
seated at the apex
of our ceiling.

61
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,333
That is Deneb, the
first-magnitude star

62
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,250
of the Cygnus constellation.

63
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,958
Nearby are Vega in
the Lyra Constellation

64
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,625
and Altair of Aquila.

65
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,375
Together, these three make
up the summer triangle.

66
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,958
This group is visible in
the Northern Hemisphere

67
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,208
all summer long.

68
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,708
Though tonight may be
a chilly autumn evening,

69
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,666
we can still see
the summer triangle

70
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,125
in the western sky
well into November,

71
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,416
as the last traces
of warmth fade.

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,583
Let's now turn our
eyes and attention

73
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,041
to the constellations of autumn.

74
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,958
I would like you to
look just to the east

75
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,083
of Deneb and Cygnus in the sky.

76
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,333
There you'll find the legendary
winged horse Pegasus.

77
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,833
Almost overlapping him is the
chained princess, Andromeda.

78
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,416
The constellations of autumn
depict characters...

79
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,916
[JUNKER] It's like I'm floating
out there among the stars.

80
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,291
[YUMEMI] Andromeda was
the daughter of Cepheus,

81
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,375
the ancient king of Ethiopia,

82
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,125
and his beautiful
wife, Cassiopeia.

83
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,625
Cassiopeia boasted that
her daughter's beauty

84
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,208
surpassed the Nereids,
nymphs of the ocean,

85
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,166
which drew the wrath of
Poseidon, the god of the sea.

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,666
Poseidon then sent
a giant sea monster

87
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,958
to ravage the shores
of Ethiopia.

88
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,500
The great beast caused
an enormous tidal wave

89
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,375
which flooded the land,
devastating Cepheus' kingdom.

90
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,916
Cepheus consulted
the Oracle of Apollo,

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,666
who told the king that the
only way to appease the god

92
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,333
was by sacrificing his
daughter to the monster.

93
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,666
Cepheus was heartbroken,
but Andromeda bravely agreed

94
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,875
to become a martyr
for her people.

95
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,916
Swallowing his sorrow, the king
chained his poor daughter

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,583
to a rock by the sea.

97
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:14,333
He then left her there,
trembling in her bonds.

98
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,125
Suddenly, the waters parted,
and out of the ocean

99
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,583
rose the horrible beast,
baring his teeth at the girl.

100
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,833
He slithered towards
her hungrily.

101
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,750
Andromeda struggled
to break free,

102
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,666
but the chains held her fast.

103
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,166
Our heroine was sure this
would be the end of her.

104
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,125
She cried out to the
Heavens for help.

105
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,916
"Save me! Someone save me!"

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,458
Just then, Perseus arrived,

107
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,750
riding the winged
horse, Pegasus.

108
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,333
He was a hero!

109
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,750
He was the only one who
could rescue Andromeda

110
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,333
from this terrible fate!

111
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,875
Perseus was on his way home

112
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
from defeating the
dreadful Gorgon Medusa.

113
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,291
He noticed something
odd on the shore,

114
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,625
and swooped down to
investigate the scene.

115
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,041
[JUNKER] At this moment,
in her strange little world,

116
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,291
she is the omnipotent
storyteller,

117
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,375
and the stars are her dominion.

118
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,791
The princesses, heroes, kings,
even the gods and monsters,

119
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,541
submit to her will.

120
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,875
They each play their
assigned part obediently

121
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,208
as she speaks them into life.

122
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,958
And so, Andromeda and Perseus
now live on as constellations.

123
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,500
They are always together,

124
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,250
their love on display each fall
evening for humanity to see.

125
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,541
Now, it's time for our
special presentation!

126
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,166
It's aptly named, "Mankind
Spreading its Wings into Space."

127
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,625
Enjoy!

128
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,750
[gasps]

129
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,541
What happened? Did it break?

130
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,791
Or is it something else?

131
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,541
[YUMEMI]
This is the fuse box.

132
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,625
[JUNKER grunts]

133
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,791
Mr. Customer, I don't
understand what happened.

134
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,375
The projectors and the axes
aren't activating again,

135
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,875
just like before.

136
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,291
Do you know how to fix her?

137
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,250
Do we have the tools
you'll need for repairs?

138
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,583
[JUNKER]
I was afraid of this.

139
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,125
It's not the projector
that's the problem.

140
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,625
[YUMEMI]
This is unacceptable.

141
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,583
We can't simply
suspend the projection

142
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,083
while customers are viewing it!

143
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,125
We must repair Miss
Jena immediately

144
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,166
and resume the presentation.
Can you do that?

145
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,041
The electricity
has been cut off.

146
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,666
The power supply,
I guess it's run out.

147
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,583
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

148
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,416
Will you please
explain it to me again?

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,166
It makes perfect sense.

150
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,958
It was a miracle, anyway.

151
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,750
This building had a
weak but steady stream

152
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,833
of electricity for years.

153
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,041
But now it's gone.

154
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,041
[YUMEMI]
Oh, so it's a power outage!

155
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,625
Well then, there's
no need to worry,

156
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,833
the back-up generator
should come on soon.

157
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,250
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

158
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,833
There's no more back-up.
That's what just ran out.

159
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,416
I think our luck did, too.

160
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,583
What happens now?

161
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,875
When will the electricity
come back on?

162
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know how to
get through to you.

163
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,833
It's never coming back on.
Do you understand that?

164
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,416
[YUMEMI]
If there's no more electricity,

165
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,416
how are we going to
restart the projection?

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,208
[grunts]

167
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,625
So then, what you're saying is,

168
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:08,125
the projection may not
be salvageable at all.

169
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,083
[JUNKER] Listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

170
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,250
Yes?

171
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,666
[JUNKER] Continue with your
part of the projection.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,166
Your voice will be enough.

173
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,666
Forgive my ignorance, sir,

174
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,666
but I don't quite
understand what you mean.

175
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,375
Keep narrating.
Just like you would.

176
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,541
I don't actually
need the projector.

177
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,958
I just wanna hear
you tell the story.

178
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,125
Do you think you can?

179
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,041
Yes! I'm sure of it!

180
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,666
It's just that it won't be the
full special presentation

181
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,125
without Miss Jena.

182
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,583
[JUNKER]
Don't worry.

183
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,541
I already know pretty much
everything about the stars.

184
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,125
But I don't know
what you'll say,

185
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,250
so your words will help me see
it from a different perspective.

186
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,125
[YUMEMI]
I've never met a customer

187
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,416
who cared so much
about the stars.

188
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I am sincerely honored to have
you as a guest in our store.

189
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,250
Your interest in the
cosmos is humbling.

190
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,291
Yeah.

191
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,333
Let's get to it.

192
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,083
As they say,
the show must go on,

193
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,333
so we must see it
through to the end.

194
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,458
Please follow me this way.

195
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,375
[JUNKER]
Amazing.

196
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,458
She's determined to do
her job, no matter what.

197
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,416
[YUMEMI]
At this time,

198
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,125
we will proceed with our
special presentation.

199
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,833
Thousands of years ago, when
the tale of man had just begun,

200
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,916
deep within the recesses
of dark and gloomy caves

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,625
lived small groups of humans
eking out their existence

202
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,875
in a hostile world.

203
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,208
Much of the Earth was
still covered in ice.

204
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:45,208
And giant, fearsome beasts
roamed the treacherous land.

205
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,500
One particularly long,
dark, and frozen night,

206
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,666
a young man awoke in his cave.

207
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,791
He was probably very cold,
and his stomach was empty,

208
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,791
so it must've been
hard to sleep.

209
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,000
With tired eyes
and aching limbs,

210
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,333
he made his way to the
entrance of the cave

211
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,291
and peered out into the
freezing night before him.

212
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,458
What he saw took
his breath away.

213
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,375
An endless sky filled
with millions of stars,

214
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,291
glittering in the darkness.

215
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,916
Perhaps that's how it began,

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,125
but there has yet been no end
to mankind's fascination

217
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,416
with space and the Heavens.

218
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,833
[YUMEMI] It's man's nature
to seek the unknown,

219
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,250
to set his sights beyond
the proposed limits,

220
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,625
to strive for the impossible.

221
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,291
It's his birthright to
shatter expectations

222
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,791
and turn failures
into opportunities.

223
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,666
His indomitable spirit
cannot be squashed,

224
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,625
and won't be contained
by Earth's atmosphere.

225
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,625
So it was inevitable
that mankind

226
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,583
would venture into outer space.

227
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,125
There it is,

228
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,875
the third planet away from the
center of the solar system.

229
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,250
Our home. The Earth.

230
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,291
Even from afar,
it's a beautiful place.

231
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,875
But man has also given rise
to a multitude of problems

232
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,625
thanks to his insatiable desire
to discover and achieve.

233
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,958
Overpopulation.
The energy crisis.

234
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:13,458
Hunger, famine,
war, and conflict.

235
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,416
And yet, I believe that
there is still hope.

236
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,958
Mankind has the ability
to solve these problems,

237
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,291
and I know he will.

238
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,666
He will find the answers
to cure these ills at home

239
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,708
and set his sights on
the realm of the stars.

240
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,875
Now, since this is such
a special occasion,

241
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,291
I'm going to let you
in on a big secret.

242
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,208
[JUNKER]
Hm?

243
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,375
Believe it or not,

244
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,458
this planetarium is
also a time machine!

245
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,791
[YUMEMI] It allows us to
travel to any point in time.

246
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,083
Whether it's the distant past,
or far ahead into the future,

247
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,000
there is no limit.

248
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,333
[YUMEMI]
See for yourself.

249
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,166
This is what the night
sky will look like

250
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,541
exactly 1,000 years
from right now.

251
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,833
Although it may not
be the real thing,

252
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,708
this is the closest Miss Jena
and I can get to showing you

253
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:13,416
the starry sky as it will appear
one millennium from this moment.

254
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,416
I implore you to take it all in.

255
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,875
Remember the way the stars
above you look today.

256
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,291
When you find yourself
lost in the dark,

257
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,000
and the open sky seems so far
away, think of this sight,

258
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,541
and know that the stars
are always out there.

259
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,583
Please take this.
It's my gift to you.

260
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,958
My little reverie.

261
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,041
So then, let's wind
back the clock

262
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,125
and return to our
own day and age.

263
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,041
The celestial spheres
are revolving.

264
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,041
Along the eastern horizon,

265
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,875
the winter constellations
now arise.

266
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,833
There's Orion,
Auriga, and Taurus.

267
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,750
They herald a glorious season,

268
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,750
and their beauty will
shine all winter long.

269
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,791
Dawn's breaking. The long
darkness ends at last.

270
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,083
Now morning greets
us all once more.

271
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,208
The sun rises to begin the day.

272
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,750
Little birds start to chirp.

273
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,875
And the wind rustles the
leaves on the trees.

274
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,791
[YUMEMI]
As the sun climbs higher,

275
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,291
it even seems to wake
the buildings and roads

276
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,500
as its warm light
reaches them.

277
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,958
Very soon, the town
will spring to life,

278
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,291
and the streets will
bustle with activity.

279
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,750
A new day will begin,
like always.

280
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,458
So good morning, everyone!

281
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, That's the end.

282
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,500
Our special presentation
is complete.

283
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,000
I am honored to have
been your host today.

284
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,958
I hope you'll come visit
us again very soon.

285
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,750
I will look forward to it. Thank
you very much for coming.

286
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,958
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer,

287
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,750
we've reached the end of
the projection for today.

288
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,458
Are you awake?

289
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,458
No, you're asleep.

290
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,416
I guess you found
my voice soothing.

291
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,416
I've taken all the
factors into account,

292
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,125
and I believe the best
course of action

293
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,041
is to allow him to continue
sleeping until tomorrow morning.

294
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,625
[YUMEMI] The manager once
told me that any human being

295
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,625
should consider it
a privilege to sleep

296
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
underneath the stars at night.

297
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,125
He said that many people
take it for granted.

298
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,625
I am certain you don't.

299
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,166
I believe that you fully
appreciate the stars,

300
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,500
in all their wonder and beauty.

301
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,166
That's why I'm happy
in this moment.

302
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,083
Because I had...

303
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,875
[JUNKER]
I let her keep talking.

304
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
I hadn't fallen asleep.

305
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,083
I was just trying to remember
what the world had been like

306
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,208
before the constant rain began.

307
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,500
Before the stars went dark.

308
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,125
Come witness the wonderful show!

309
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,875
Visit our majestic planetarium!

310
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,250
It's glorious!

311
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,291
The sparkling, eternal Heavens,

312
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,416
whose beauty will never
fade, no matter what.

313
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,125
All the stars in the sky await.

314
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,250
Good morning to you,
Mr. Customer.

315
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,333
I hope you're
feeling well today.

316
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,916
No better than usual.
No worse, though.

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
[YUMEMI]
Interesting.

318
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,000
If you do start to feel worse,
don't hesitate to let me know.

319
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,666
I'm okay, really.

320
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,250
Good. I'm very happy
to hear that.

321
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,166
Also, one more thing.

322
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,041
It's about our presentation.

323
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
I apologize if
it didn't satisfy.

324
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,250
I sincerely hope
you can forgive me.

325
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,708
It's fine. I kind of
enjoyed it, actually.

326
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,041
You did the best that you could.

327
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,541
Thank you for saying so.

328
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,583
I'm glad you feel that way.

329
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,166
And I must add that you have
been a great deal of help

330
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,083
to Miss Jena and me.

331
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,625
Hey, I was wondering.

332
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,583
When I leave...

333
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,541
What is it, sir?

334
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,666
Don't worry about it.

335
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,708
I suppose this is goodbye, then.

336
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,500
[YUMEMI] Yes. Thank you for
everything, Mr. Customer.

337
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,208
Say a prayer to god of
robots for me, will ya?

338
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,875
That I survive the trip back.

339
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,166
Yes.

340
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,500
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer!

341
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,666
[YUMEMI]
I'm sorry to bother you,

342
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,291
but I have to ask you something.

343
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,208
What is it?

344
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,416
Did you want me to pray

345
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,583
because your journey
home will be dangerous?

346
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,458
I'd be lying to you if
I told you it was safe.

347
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,958
[YUMEMI] How will you get there?
Will you be taking the subway?

348
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,541
The subways aren't running now.

349
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,875
There's no electricity
to power them.

350
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,791
Then will you take
a bus or taxi?

351
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,166
Will you be in some
kind of vehicle?

352
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,708
I'll take my car. If it's there.

353
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,166
In regards to your automobile's
current location,

354
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,375
is it within a three kilometer
radius of this facility?

355
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,875
If I had to bet,
I'd say it was.

356
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,625
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

357
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,833
I have attempted to
contact the support center

358
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,416
for authorization to be released

359
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,958
in order to uphold my
professional code.

360
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,000
I have received no response.

361
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,750
In this case, I may
use my discretion.

362
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,208
I am allowed to make this
decision without their approval.

363
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,791
I will escort you to your car.

364
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,666
To help you get home safely.

365
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,916
What?

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,833
It is a robot's duty to
look after human needs.

367
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,875
You're unwell, so I'm
obligated to assist you.

368
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,708
Are you crazy?

369
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,666
No. Not crazy.
Just a bit broken.
