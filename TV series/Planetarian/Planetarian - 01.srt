1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,875
[YUMEMI "Hoshino Yumemi"?
Is that my name?

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,375
[SATOMI]
Yes, that's what we'll call you.

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,041
Great! The video's live.

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,500
Twelve hundred sixty-three
people entered the contest,

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,041
and that's the name
that was chosen.

6
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,666
Don't you think it's lovely?

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,416
[YUMEMI] Yes, that's a very
beautiful name for a robot.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,750
I'm honored to
have it, thank you.

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,125
[MANAGER laughs]

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,583
We didn't have much
to do with it.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,500
You should thank the
customers instead.

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,625
We wish you luck.
You'll be great!

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,458
[YUMEMI]
Thanks. I'll do my best!

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,000
Listen, Yumemi.
We have to leave.

15
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,208
You're going to stay here

16
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,250
while the rest of us
go on a long trip.

17
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,000
[YUMEMI] I understand.
That sounds so exciting, though!

18
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,625
[SATOMI]
Oh, Yumemi.

19
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,541
We need you to wait
here until we get back.

20
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,750
Do you think you
can do that for us?

21
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,166
[YUMEMI] Of course!
I'll be here when you return.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,500
When should I expect
to see you again?

23
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,083
I don't know.

24
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,583
That part is unclear right now,

25
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,583
but we will come back,
I'm certain of it.

26
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,958
I wish I could give
you more information.

27
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,458
It's all going to be okay.

28
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,458
And when we return
from our trip,

29
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,208
do you think you'll
work with us again?

30
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,708
[YUMEMI]
Absolutely, Mr. Manager.

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,166
[JUNKER]
It was a Sarcophagus City.

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,250
More than 30 years ago,
in the early days of the war,

33
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,375
a brutal germ-bomb
attack emptied the city.

34
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,250
Nothing was left but
the junk and the dead.

35
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,625
Damn it. These guys
don't quit, do they?

36
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,041
[JUNKER] Anti-personnel tanks
still try to keep intruders out.

37
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,875
Even though the city's
been rubble for decades.

38
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,166
[JUNKER]
Is that a military installation?

39
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:55,291
[JUNKER panting]

40
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,208
[sighs]

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,208
[JUNKER] I was on the
hunt for provisions.

42
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,083
Sealed, preserved food. Medical
supplies. Precision equipment.

43
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,375
Functional weapons
and ammunition.

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,541
[glass shatters]

45
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,375
[JUNKER]
Anything useful or profitable.

46
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,666
That was my job,
like any other poor soul

47
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,708
who calls himself a Junker.

48
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,625
Hello?

49
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,666
[JUNKER] Why would this
place have electricity?

50
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,750
It doesn't seem like
a military base.

51
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,791
[YUMEMI] Welcome, sir!
And congratulations!

52
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,625
You're our two million,
500 thousandth customer!

53
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,458
[JUNKER] What the hell is a
woman doing in this place?

54
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,791
[JUNKER]
State your intentions, now.

55
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:06,708
[gasps]

56
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,291
[YUMEMI]
I owe you an apology.

57
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,458
I humbly, sincerely ask
for your forgiveness.

58
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,208
What I said before was a lie.

59
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:19,750
To be precise, you are actually
the 2,487,288th customer.

60
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,083
Well, as a matter of fact,

61
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,791
that's not exactly
accurate, either.

62
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,625
Many years ago,
I made an exception

63
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,625
and allowed a little girl
and boy to enter for free.

64
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,208
I chose to break the rules
purely out of kindness,

65
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,666
even though, between
the two of them,

66
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,666
they could not afford
the price of admission.

67
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,500
So technically, if I
count those two children,

68
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:43,458
you are the
2,487,290th customer.

69
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,875
I apologize. Please
forgive my carelessness.

70
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,000
[YUMEMI]
So then, Mr. Customer,

71
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,416
you are the very first
person to visit us here

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,708
in exactly 29 years and 81 days!

73
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,708
It's my pleasure to welcome you
to the rooftop planetarium

74
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,166
of the Flowercrest
department store!

75
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,291
Are you a robot?

76
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,208
[YUMEMI]
Yes! I am a robot!

77
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,250
My name is Hoshino Yumemi,
and I am on the staff here!

78
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,958
[JUNKER]
What the hell is that?

79
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,541
It's a bouquet!

80
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,041
Please accept this as a token
to commemorate your visit here!

81
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,166
You call this a bouquet?

82
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,000
[YUMEMI]
I'm very sorry!

83
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,416
I was unable to acquire
actual flowers,

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,041
so I had to improvise.

85
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
The flower shop on
the first floor

86
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,708
has not answered my
calls in several years.

87
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,000
So I worked with what
I had available.

88
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,250
Are you broken or something?

89
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,541
Yes. I am a little bit broken.

90
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,333
Currently, there is
an unknown bug

91
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,875
in my self-diagnostic
subroutines.

92
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,875
My backup CMOS battery is
depleted and must be replaced.

93
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,000
My cervical vertebral power
unit's operational lifespan

94
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,875
has expired and needs an update.

95
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,791
My personal
information databases

96
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,958
and conversational
subroutines have issues

97
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,541
which need addressing.

98
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,666
The lattermost problem results
in verbose conversation patterns

99
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,416
which do not take time
into consideration.

100
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Dammit.

101
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,208
Pardon me, Mr. Customer.

102
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,458
[YUMEMI] Oh! Would I
be correct in assuming

103
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,500
that you are not feeling well?

104
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,500
May I escort you to our
department store's

105
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,083
medical offices, Mr. Customer?

106
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,750
Mr. Customer?

107
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,041
Please shut up.

108
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,583
I'm not a customer,
and no, I'm not sick.

109
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,333
What a relief!

110
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,583
In that case, the
projection is set to begin

111
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,291
in approximately seven minutes.

112
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,625
Please take your...

113
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,250
[JUNKER] This thing never
stops babbling, does it?

114
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,916
How many times do I have
to say I'm not a customer?

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,166
Yes, I heard you.

116
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,666
But since you're here,

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,708
why not take in the lovely
sights and sounds of our show?

118
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,958
[JUNKER]
Shut up.

119
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,250
The projection will only
last about 45 minutes.

120
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,291
[JUNKER]
Will you stop talking?

121
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,541
And I'm sorry,

122
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,916
but there is no smoking
during the presentation.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,416
That's enough!

124
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,833
I'm begging you, shut your
mouth right now before I snap!

125
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,208
Yes. I am happy to comply.

126
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,666
[JUNKER]
Finally.

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,125
[YUMEMI] However, I have a
request of my own to make.

128
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,583
If you will allow
me to voice it.

129
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,291
I promise to keep my
silence afterwards.

130
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:19,166
So far you've only managed
that for three seconds.

131
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,083
If it's not too much to
ask, please consider it.

132
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,000
I would like you to watch
the special projection

133
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,750
we've prepared,
commemorating your visit

134
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,166
as the two million, 500
thousandth customer!

135
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,458
[JUNKER sighs]

136
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,750
If it'll keep you quiet.

137
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,083
[YUMEMI]
Thank you very much!

138
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,458
Now please wait while
I prepare the projection!

139
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,041
We are so happy to celebrate

140
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,500
this momentous
occasion with you!

141
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,500
Hold on a second.

142
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,833
Yes?

143
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,958
Is there something else
that I can help you with?

144
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,208
What's this projection gonna be?

145
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,833
Is it a holovid?

146
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,041
It's the starry sky.

147
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,375
Are you serious?

148
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes. It's very pretty.

149
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,875
I remember it. I think.

150
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,875
[JUNKER]
I've only got two more left.

151
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,916
What the--?

152
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,666
May I have your
attention, please?

153
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,750
It is my honor to welcome you
to the rooftop planetarium

154
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,500
of the Flowercrest
department store.

155
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,625
I'm your host.

156
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
My name's Hoshino Yumemi,

157
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,666
and I'm proud to serve
on the staff here.

158
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,958
Before we begin
today's presentation,

159
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,083
I have a few important
announcements for you.

160
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,125
Please refrain from
talking or whispering

161
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,333
during the projection,

162
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,708
as this could annoy
your fellow customers.

163
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,625
Maybe I can dry these
out and save them.

164
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,375
[YUMEMI] We politely
ask that you turn off

165
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:50,333
all cellular devices,
and silence your alarms.

166
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,875
In addition, eating,
drinking, and smoking

167
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,791
are strictly prohibited for the
entirety of the demonstration.

168
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,666
And now, without further ado,

169
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,208
allow me to introduce the
true star of this show,

170
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,333
the one who makes
it all possible!

171
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,291
Let's welcome her with
a warm round of applause!

172
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,000
Miss Jena!

173
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,000
[YUMEMI]
To be perfectly honest,

174
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,500
while we have given
her a human name,

175
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,541
Miss Jena is what
we call the machine

176
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,125
which projects the night sky!

177
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,041
[YUMEMI]
Um, Mr. Customer?

178
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,208
You missed your cue
to laugh at the joke.

179
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,375
That was supposed to be funny?

180
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,083
Just start the
presentation already.

181
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,791
Thank you for your patience.

182
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,708
And I must admit,
I am quite pleased

183
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,125
by your anticipation
for today's show.

184
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,958
Well, I wouldn't go
as far as that.

185
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,166
[YUMEMI]
Let's begin!

186
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,375
It's her big moment,
so I'll hand it over!

187
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,458
Say hello to the
audience, Miss Jena!

188
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,583
Sorry. Let's try that again.

189
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,833
Say hello to the
audience, Miss Jena!

190
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,291
Wow, these stars are
really pretty, Miss Jena.

191
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,458
This is awkward.

192
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,000
Please forgive our mishap,
Mister Customer!

193
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,000
I humbly beg your pardon!

194
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,500
[grumbles]

195
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,208
I find it humiliating
to confess this to you,

196
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,375
but it seems that our
projector, Miss Jena,

197
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,958
is in a serious
state of disrepair.

198
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,708
Mr. Manager and the
rest of the staff

199
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,083
are all still away
on a long trip.

200
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,208
A simple unit like me
cannot grasp the situation.

201
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,958
Whatever. I don't care.
I'm not worried about it.

202
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,291
[OLDER JUNKER]
Y'know what annoyed me

203
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,250
more than anything
about hunting for stuff

204
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,708
in that godforsaken
Sarcophagus City?

205
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:19,333
It was being followed around
by that stupid, babbling robot.

206
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,541
I thought I'd like
some interaction.

207
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,291
But you're better
off ignoring it,

208
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,708
no matter how much it
tries to talk to you.

209
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,500
[grunts]

210
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,666
[JUNKER]
That damn bouquet.

211
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,000
The old man was right.

212
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,583
[JUNKER] Looks like I
slept for a whole day.

213
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,666
[YUMEMI] Come visit our
majestic planetarium!

214
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,333
The sparkling, eternal Heavens,

215
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,041
whose beauty will never
fade, no matter what!

216
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,583
Join us and see for yourself!

217
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,750
All the stars in
the sky await you!

218
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,000
Come witness the glorious show!

219
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Come visit our
majestic planetarium!

220
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,791
Hello there, Mr. Customer!
Are you feeling all right?

221
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,458
I'm fine, I guess.
I fell asleep, that's all.

222
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,125
I only have about an hour
before the sun starts to set.

223
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,375
I didn't know you had such
an interest in the stars.

224
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,875
What makes you say that?

225
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,250
Your pendant depicts the sign
of a famous constellation.

226
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,750
That is Cygnus, the Swan.

227
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,708
[JUNKER]
Oh, this thing.

228
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,250
Anyway, I've gotta get going.
I'll see you around.

229
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,833
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer?

230
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,000
The next projection starts in 18
minutes, if you'd like to wait.

231
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:48,250
That device is still broken.
There's nothing to see.

232
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,208
When you talk about
"that device,"

233
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,958
are you referring to Miss Jena?

234
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,000
[JUNKER]
Yeah, I am.

235
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,625
Well, our Miss Jena
is out of order.

236
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,333
But if you'd like to wait,
repairs should be done soon.

237
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,166
Then you can see the starry sky!

238
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,708
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I hate waiting.

239
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,250
There's no need to be bored!

240
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,916
Why not shop in
the department store

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,041
until Miss Jena's
repairs are completed?

242
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,333
I can give you coupons for
discounts on merchandise.

243
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,541
Sure, I'll go shop for 30 years.

244
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,541
Can't wait for those
great discounts.

245
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,500
You'll find bargains everywhere.

246
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,291
At Flowercrest, we are
known for our fair prices.

247
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,375
And with these special coupons,
you'll get an even better deal!

248
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,958
[JUNKER]
So much for sarcasm.

249
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,958
[YUMEMI]
Um, Mr. Customer?

250
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,041
It appears to me that
you're feeling a little bit

251
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,625
under the weather today.

252
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,291
If you'd like, I can escort you
to our facility's infirmary--

253
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,791
Enough already!

254
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:43,125
I am not familiar with that
phrase. What does it mean?

255
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,833
[JUNKER sighs]

256
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,583
[JUNKER] It means,
thanks for your concern.

257
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,583
I'll be downstairs. Come get me
when the repairs are finished.

258
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,416
[YUMEMI]
Yes, I understand.

259
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
[JUNKER] I thought I'd never
get outta this place.

260
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:58,208
[YUMEMI] Thank you so very much!
I look forward to your return!

261
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,833
To be honest with you,

262
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,458
I was afraid I had angered
you with my mistakes.

263
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,000
It would make me very unhappy
to know I had upset you

264
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,458
by being so careless.

265
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,000
We robots take pleasure
in bringing humans joy,

266
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,458
as it makes us feel good
to know we are of service.

267
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,708
I always wanna do
my best to help.

268
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,250
And I try to make up
for my mistakes.

269
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,458
When the repairs are done,

270
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,416
I'll call you over the
store's PA system.

271
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,666
[YUMEMI] We created this
spectacular presentation

272
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,458
to commemorate your arrival.

273
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,958
When you come back,
you can view it

274
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,041
in addition to our
regular programming.

275
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,416
That's great.

276
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,375
You'll have the great honor
of being the very first

277
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,375
to see our exciting
new projection.

278
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,791
Everyone here at Flowercrest
has worked very hard

279
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,291
to create such a stunning
presentation for you.

280
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,916
I hope to honor them and you

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,208
by playing my part
without mistakes.

282
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,583
And don't worry, I will make
sure to keep your bouquet

283
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,375
safe and sound for
you while the repairs

284
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,791
are being made to Miss Jena.

285
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,500
I will humbly await your return.
