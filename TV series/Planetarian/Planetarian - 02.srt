1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,250
[JUNKER] The whole thing
started a few decades ago,

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,708
when a rogue nation launched
a genetic bio-weapon.

3
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,583
[JUNKER] Not long after,
another country retaliated

4
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:26,208
with a thermonuclear warhead.

5
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,083
The war went on for years.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,625
Millions of people all
over the world died.

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:35,333
And the ones who lived have no
interest in space or the stars.

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,625
I guess I say all of that so
you know things have changed.

9
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,708
The world you knew,

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,125
and everything you
remember about it,

11
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,250
doesn't even exist anymore.

12
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,958
[YUMEMI] I have made
many attempts to connect

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,708
to the support
center's databases,

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,583
but I can never get through.

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,750
Shocker.

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,333
[YUMEMI]
On another note, Mr. Customer,

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,750
if you don't mind my
changing the subject--

18
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,083
Here's this tool.

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,083
I thought you may need
to use it for the repairs.

20
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,291
[JUNKER]
Well, I don't.

21
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,083
Oh, really?

22
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,500
Like I said, don't do
anything unless I ask.

23
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,916
Yes. Order acknowledged.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,875
Excuse me, Mr. Customer.

25
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,375
Do you think you'll be using
this tool anytime soon?

26
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,083
[JUNKER] Why don't you use it
to clamp your mouth shut?

27
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,916
[JUNKER] I have no idea
why I'm even doing this.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,208
Boredom, maybe?
A change of pace?

29
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,583
I do know it's dangerous to
leave now that it's dark out.

30
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,833
I guess I've got
nothing better to do.

31
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:42,208
Also, I underestimated
how hard it would be.

32
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,208
This ancient machine is more
complicated than I thought.

33
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,583
I've been wondering.

34
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,375
How much time do you
estimate it will take

35
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,833
before the repairs to
Miss Jena are completed?

36
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,166
Who knows? But it
might be a while.

37
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,458
[YUMEMI]
Do you think you will finish up

38
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,000
in time for tomorrow's
11 AM projection?

39
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,958
[JUNKER]
It doesn't look that way.

40
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,333
[YUMEMI] If that's the case,
do you mind if I put up a sign

41
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,208
saying the projection
is cancelled?

42
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,291
[JUNKER]
Do whatever you want.

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,583
Consent acknowledged.

44
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,375
I will register this
in my database

45
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,458
as a critical directive.

46
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,333
Hey, this lightbulb is burnt out

47
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,833
and I think that's
part of the problem.

48
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,250
Do you have another
one somewhere?

49
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,916
[YUMEMI] Mr. Customer, I
apologize for interrupting you,

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,958
however, I must inform you
that it's almost midnight.

51
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,125
According to my
established protocol,

52
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,833
at that hour I must switch
my functions to sleep mode.

53
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,291
[JUNKER]
What?

54
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,833
[YUMEMI]
At 9 o'clock tomorrow morning,

55
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,083
I will reactivate.

56
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,458
Upon that time,
I will have 75 hours

57
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,375
of operational time remaining.

58
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,083
I must go now.
Have a good night.

59
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,916
Hey, wait a minute!

60
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,500
Whatever.

61
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,500
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer!

62
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,208
Mr. Customer!

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,125
Good morning, Mr. Customer.
Did you sleep well?

64
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,791
Were you trying to talk to me?

65
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,083
Yes.

66
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,791
Sorry. I was dreaming.

67
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,791
Oh, that's wonderful to hear.

68
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,583
Were you having
a pleasant dream?

69
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,916
Nope.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,833
Robots are incapable of that.

71
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,666
So the idea has always
been fascinating to me.

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,458
To be perfectly honest with you,

73
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,958
I long to know what
it's like to have them!

74
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,583
Most of them aren't
worth longing for.

75
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,708
Dreaming's kind of overrated.

76
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,000
Is that really true?

77
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,500
[JUNKER]
Wait a second.

78
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,708
Let me get this straight,

79
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,625
you mean you're only
operational for one week

80
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,041
outta the whole year?

81
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,541
[YUMEMI]
Yes.

82
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,625
For the last 30 years, the
amount of electricity supplied

83
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,416
to the department store has
significantly decreased.

84
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,833
Per protocol, I entered
energy-saver mode

85
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,458
when power levels declined.

86
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,958
I powered on two
days ago at 9 AM.

87
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,541
It's the first time I've
operated in 8,601 hours.

88
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,375
[JUNKER sighs]

89
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,583
[JUNKER] I showed up
right at the perfect time.

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,666
What're the odds?

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,541
[YUMEMI]
Five days from now, at midnight,

92
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,583
I will return to my long-term
power charging mode.

93
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,166
Right, I get it.

94
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,875
[JUNKER] I can't believe
the emergency power

95
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,125
is even on anymore.

96
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,500
[YUMEMI]
I've been wondering,

97
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,375
why are you using that
flask to collect the rain?

98
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:35,291
[JUNKER] I'm gonna drink it.
I am human, after all.

99
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,458
Unlike you, I need
water to live.

100
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,625
If you're thirsty, I would
be delighted to prepare

101
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,166
a nice beverage for you.

102
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,333
[JUNKER]
Are you serious?

103
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,666
[YUMEMI]
Yes.

104
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,166
I don't mean to boast,
but I have been programmed

105
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,208
to make an incredible
cup of tea.

106
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,458
Or would you prefer a cup
of freshly ground coffee?

107
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,208
Coffee, huh?

108
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
Do know where to
find any alcohol?

109
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,208
Like, bottles of distilled
liquor with unbroken seals?

110
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,458
That kind of thing is
particularly important to me,

111
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,083
you know.

112
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,500
Yes. We have that!

113
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,916
Really? Where is it?

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,791
Well, the liquor store
is on floor B1.

115
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,166
You can find a wide
variety of spirits there.

116
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,958
Right. Sure I can.

117
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,375
Great!

118
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,083
On another note, Mr. Customer,

119
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,333
what is the situation
with Miss Jena?

120
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,750
Are there any updates on
the state of her repairs?

121
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,791
Same as it was last night.
I'm still working on it.

122
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,000
Understood.

123
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,416
In that case, I will announce

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,375
that today's presentation
is cancelled.

125
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,625
[JUNKER]
Hey, so, uh,

126
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,750
do you know where I could find
any replacement lightbulbs?

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,875
[YUMEMI] Two of the
latest 905 series models

128
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,916
were recently assigned
to work at the help desk

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,041
by the main entrance
of the store.

130
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,833
Both of them are top of
the line FT editions.

131
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,750
And they are designed to look
much more grown up than I do.

132
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,708
Their faceplates were made
with superb, life-like detail,

133
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,875
and they can even
shed real tears.

134
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,000
Robo-tears, weird.

135
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,958
'Kay, you can turn it on now.

136
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:06,000
[YUMEMI]
Yes, sir, switching it on.

137
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,166
This one's working. Good.

138
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,583
So does that mean
you can't shed tears?

139
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,583
Hold this.

140
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,791
Yes. I am one of
the older models.

141
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,250
Crying was introduced
in the 9,000 series,

142
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,125
just before the 905s.

143
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,875
Oh, yeah? That's
really fascinating.

144
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,166
Now--

145
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,541
Flip it.

146
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,916
[YUMEMI]
Yes, sir.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,833
Looks like we have a dud.

148
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,750
So we've got two live bulbs.

149
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,166
By the way, would
it be all right

150
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,916
if I removed this maintenance
cable from my ear port?

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,833
It's just that I'm usually not
allowed to let customers

152
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:42,083
see my emergency procedures,
and I feel rather ashamed.

153
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,000
Hold on a bit. I wanna
try the motors first.

154
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,958
Yes, I understand, sir.

155
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,500
May I ask a question?

156
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,125
[JUNKER]
Seems I can't stop you.

157
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,500
I would really like to know,

158
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,041
what does it feel like
when you're crying?

159
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,416
[JUNKER]
I don't know.

160
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,208
I guess it just
feels like crying.

161
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,666
I've never thought about it.

162
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,250
Oh, really?

163
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,416
Well, this might sound strange,

164
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,583
but I have always wanted
to be able to cry.

165
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,583
I'm just a bargain
edition model.

166
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,291
I don't have that capability.

167
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,791
But I would love
to experience tears.

168
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,875
It's not as great as
you make it out to be.

169
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,166
[YUMEMI]
Do you really mean that?

170
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,708
Yeah. I'd rather not cry.

171
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,625
All right, move the
latitude axis upwards.

172
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,958
Slowly, though.

173
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,500
[YUMEMI]
Yes, sir.

174
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,291
For your safety, please move
out of the radius of revolution

175
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,583
while Miss Jena is in motion.

176
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:34,625
[humming]

177
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,333
[BOTH sigh]

178
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,708
Excuse me. How much longer
do you think it will take?

179
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,125
When do you estimate the repairs
to Miss Jena will be complete?

180
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,291
I can't tell.

181
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,541
Do you believe that
you will be finished

182
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,875
in time for tomorrow's
11 AM projection?

183
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,166
I dunno. Pray it will be.

184
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,583
Okay. To which god do you
recommend that I pray for help?

185
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,791
What did you say?

186
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,958
For example, I know
about the Greek gods.

187
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,583
There's Zeus, Athena,
Apollo, Hermes,

188
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,500
Artemis, Demeter,
Poseidon, Hades.

189
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,833
You sure know a lot.

190
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,458
Well, pray to whichever
one you like best.

191
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,250
Right. In that case, I would
like to pray to Dionysus.

192
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,166
[JUNKER]
Who in the hell is that?

193
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,875
The god of wine and fertility.

194
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,875
In Rome, he's referred
to as Bacchus.

195
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,416
I thought this god would be most
to your liking, Mr. Customer.

196
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,458
You know how I feel
about alcohol.

197
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,916
But wouldn't it make more sense

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,291
if you prayed to your
god instead of mine?

199
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,125
What do you mean by my god?

200
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,541
[JUNKER]
The god of robots, of course.

201
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,833
[YUMEMI]
I have searched my database,

202
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,875
and no information on a
god of robots turns up.

203
00:08:58,958 --> 00:08:59,625
[sighs]

204
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,125
That figures.

205
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,375
[YUMEMI] That being said, I did
discover something related

206
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,958
that I would like to share.

207
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,750
This is from a meeting we had
about the mythological Heavens,

208
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,541
which we featured in
a special presentation.

209
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,375
I saved it in my
database as a hologram.

210
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,083
[YUMEMI] Is there a Heaven
for deactivated robots, too?

211
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,375
Of course! Robots get
their own Heaven!

212
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,416
Right, Manager?

213
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,916
Uh. Yes. That's the truth.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
[YUMEMI]
What is it like in Robot Heaven?

215
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,666
Well, let's see... Uh...

216
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,250
No one ever malfunctions,
and batteries last forever,

217
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
and everyone can dream and cry!

218
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,916
What else?

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Um, there's no such
thing as software bugs,

220
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,708
and parts never need to
be repaired or replaced!

221
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,208
And on top of all that,

222
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,541
every little wish you've ever
had will come true there!

223
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,916
[YUMEMI]
Is all of that real?

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,791
--Yeah. Sure.
--Uh-huh!

225
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,416
Well, there you go.

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,583
Then the god of your kind
is up in Robot Heaven.

227
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,166
Pray to that one.

228
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,916
Good. New critical data
registered in the database.

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,750
I'm quite happy to
learn about this.

230
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,833
It's nice to have a god.

231
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,916
I know of one thing for
which I would like to pray

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,375
to my new deity, now
that I know one exists.

233
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,833
Oh, yeah?

234
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,250
What's that? What would
you ask god for?

235
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,750
Well, Robot Heaven--

236
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,375
[JUNKER]
Hm? What's the matter?

237
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,583
Mr. Customer, I'm sorry,
but midnight approaches.

238
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,500
As per established protocol
due to limited power,

239
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,166
I'll have to continue with
this conversation later.

240
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,875
At this time, I must activate
sleep mode until tomorrow.

241
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,666
It got late fast, huh?

242
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,291
I'll resume normal
function at 9 AM.

243
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,916
Remaining operation time
upon reactivation

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,916
will be exactly 60 hours.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,750
Good night. See you tomorrow.

246
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,125
[YUMEMI] Come visit our
majestic planetarium!

247
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,916
The sparkling, eternal Heavens,

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,666
whose beauty will never
fade, no matter what!

249
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,833
Join us and see for yourself?

250
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,375
All the stars in
the sky await you!

251
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,416
[JUNKER]
Hey, I'm done with the repairs.

252
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,583
Oh, Mr. Customer.

253
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,791
Do you mean to say that
Miss Jena has been restored

254
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,250
to her full
operational capacity?

255
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,875
Yeah. That's right.

256
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,625
I did the best I could,
and I'm pretty sure it worked.

257
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,291
[giggles]
