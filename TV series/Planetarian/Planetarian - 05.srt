1
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,375
[JUNKER]
I can't believe I missed.

2
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,250
That's gonna cost me.

3
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,750
[JUNKER]
I've got two more rounds.

4
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,750
I need to get in as
close as possible

5
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,875
and take out a leg
to immobilize him.

6
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,958
Then I'll score a direct
hit to his topside armor

7
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,041
and finish the bastard off.

8
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,625
He's trying to not
waste his ammo.

9
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,291
That's pretty standard
when engaging an enemy

10
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,375
with an unknown
amount of firepower.

11
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,750
He'll start shooting
again in a second.

12
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,000
Called it!

13
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,125
[JUNKER]
One. Two. Three.

14
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:33,708
[JUNKER] I can't hear a thing.
I'd better assess the damage.

15
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,208
[JUNKER] It takes him
30 seconds to reload.

16
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,291
I don't have much time.

17
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,833
That feels broken.

18
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,708
How biblical. An eye for an eye
and a leg for a leg, right?

19
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
[screams]

20
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,166
[gasps]

21
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,250
[JUNKER] Why would you
do something so stupid?

22
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,750
Mr. Customer. Nice to see you.

23
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,000
I hope that you have
not been injured.

24
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,041
I told you not to move
until I came back!

25
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,750
[YUMEMI]
This non-registered machine

26
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,750
appears to be in
a rampant state.

27
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,250
A force-stop signal was
sent to this apparatus,

28
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,791
however the directive
has been ignored.

29
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,208
Upon suspicion that the device
contained a faulty receiver,

30
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,375
an emergency physical
shut-down was attempted.

31
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,916
The attempt has failed.

32
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,125
It appears that the rampant
machine has ceased

33
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,250
all normal function and
must be dealt with directly.

34
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,916
Please step away from the device

35
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,416
and promptly report the
incident to the police.

36
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,583
Contact your nearest
support center immediately.

37
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,375
I did disobey your
critical order.

38
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,250
And I'm very sorry about that.

39
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,000
I was following
another directive

40
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,041
which took precedence
over yours.

41
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,500
A long time ago,
I promised to never allow

42
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,666
any human being to be harmed.

43
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,666
That is our mission
in the world.

44
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,708
Robots--this is why we exist.

45
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,833
So tell me, did you incur
any injuries, sir?

46
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,166
[JUNKER] Yeah. But don't
worry, I'll be all right.

47
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,583
I'm relieved. I was concerned.

48
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,541
I apologize on his behalf.
Perhaps he is broken, as well.

49
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,416
I can't imagine why he would
ever do anything to hurt you

50
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,666
if he's not.

51
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,458
Like I've told you before.
We make humans happy.

52
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,791
That's why robots were created.

53
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,708
So I'm sure he didn't mean it.

54
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,125
He would never want to
cause you pain on purpose.

55
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,666
He's my kind. We're the same.

56
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,958
I'm broken. He is, too.
So I can understand him.

57
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,666
[YUMEMI] My emergency
batteries will run out soon.

58
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,875
I have approximately
600 seconds left.

59
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,291
My backup batteries
are already empty,

60
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:06,166
so I will not be able
to reboot after that.

61
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,208
I've been sending a maintenance
request call this whole time,

62
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,125
but it has yet to
be acknowledged.

63
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,166
It's funny. I feel lonely.

64
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,041
I won't leave you here.
I'll stay with you.

65
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,958
It's okay.

66
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,416
At least let me try to fix you.

67
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,666
[YUMEMI] Please forgive
my disorderly state.

68
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,875
I wish you didn't have
to see me like this.

69
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,541
I don't want to worry you.

70
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,041
Robots are not
programmed to feel pain.

71
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,375
So despite how it looks,
I'm comfortable.

72
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,625
With some repairs, I can
be completely restored.

73
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,875
I can be made new again.

74
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,750
Or put into an undamaged body.

75
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,166
There aren't any
more new bodies.

76
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,625
There's nothing left.

77
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:57,166
And all the humans that you
ever knew... they're all gone.

78
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,166
Dead.

79
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,041
Why is your expression so
sad? Do you feel unhappy?

80
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,333
I hope that you don't.

81
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,250
But if so, I'd like to help.

82
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,875
That's all I want in the world,
to make you smile again.

83
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,041
You know, I was
built to remember.

84
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,333
It's one of my featured traits.

85
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,458
So let me show you
some of my memories.

86
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,666
[YUMEMI]
I am Hoshino Yumemi.

87
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,791
I'm delighted to meet
and thank the people

88
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,750
who gave me that wonderful name!

89
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,083
I'm honored to serve you!

90
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,041
I promise to work very hard.

91
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,375
[applause]

92
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:41,500
Yumemi. Here, for you!

93
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,916
Thank you. The stars
were so incredible!

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,541
I can't wait to come back
and bring all my friends!

95
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,416
I'll see you again next time!

96
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,166
I'll be bringing my
wife by next month

97
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,708
for our anniversary, 'kay?

98
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,125
The stars were
beautiful. Really.

99
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,750
Like when I was a kid.

100
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,166
I'll be back next year.

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,125
I hope to see you then.
I'll be looking forward to it.

102
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,416
I learned all about space
and constellations.

103
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,833
And I had fun!

104
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,833
I'm going to make my
summer science project

105
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,458
all about Yumemi
and the planetarium!

106
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,625
Well, um, the stars were pretty.
And the stories were super cool!

107
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,583
I'm gonna tell my
whole class about it!

108
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,333
I love you! Bye-bye!

109
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,791
[YUMEMI]
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,500
I love you, too, and I
eagerly await your return.

111
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,250
Listen, Yumemi.
We have to leave.

112
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,416
You're going to stay here

113
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
while the rest of us
go on a long trip.

114
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,250
[YUMEMI] I understand.
That sounds so exciting, though!

115
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,791
[SATOMI]
Oh, Yumemi.

116
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
We need you to wait
here until we get back.

117
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,291
Do you think you
can do that for us?

118
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,708
[YUMEMI] Of course!
I'll be here when you return.

119
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,708
When should I expect
to see you again?

120
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,541
I don't know.

121
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,625
That part is unclear right now,

122
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,708
but we will come back,
I'm certain of it.

123
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,000
I wish I could give
you more information.

124
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,583
It's all going to be okay.

125
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,500
And when we return
from our trip,

126
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,250
do you think you'll
work with us again?

127
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,791
[YUMEMI]
Absolutely, Mr. Manager.

128
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,500
Yumemi. I'm sorry.

129
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,958
I wish you could come. I hate
that we have to leave you.

130
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,458
[YUMEMI]
Don't cry.

131
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,291
I'll be right here waiting with
Miss Jena, safe and sound.

132
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,416
Enjoy your trip, and please
don't worry about me.

133
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,875
I'm going to be just fine!

134
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,041
I'll look after the planetarium.
You can count on me.

135
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,500
Just have fun and be safe.
I'll see you all very soon!

136
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,125
[YUMEMI] That was 29
years and 71 days ago.

137
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,833
A very long time.

138
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,375
It's been even longer
since we opened.

139
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,833
That first projection,
44 years, 138 days.

140
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,208
You see?

141
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,750
For all these years, before
you came, I wondered...

142
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,291
Where were they?
Were they all happy?

143
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,250
What could've
happened to them?

144
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,333
What trip is that long?

145
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,916
Was I ever going
to see them again?

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,666
And then I started to think,

147
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,625
"would the customers
ever return?"

148
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,750
But sadly, when I
consulted all of the data,

149
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,625
I always got the same answer.

150
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,875
No humans would
ever be coming back.

151
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,250
And yet, I knew that
couldn't be true.

152
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,666
So I had an idea.

153
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,791
There must be something
wrong with my program.

154
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,083
I thought for sure
I had to be broken,

155
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,875
so I ran self-diagnostic tests.

156
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,083
But I couldn't find
anything out of order,

157
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,625
no matter how many
times I looked.

158
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,541
I concluded that the bug must be

159
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,875
within my self-diagnostic
process codes.

160
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,583
I was so happy when you arrived.

161
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,916
I knew then, I had been
wrong the whole time.

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,083
The people had not
forgotten about me at all.

163
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,291
They would come back,

164
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,416
and the planetarium
could bring people joy

165
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,250
just like it had before.

166
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,833
I believed that was true.

167
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,666
And for the first time in
years, I felt hope again.

168
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:18,458
And yet, I was wrong
about that, too.

169
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,125
I wasn't broken, after all.

170
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,458
But everything around me was.

171
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:31,541
I don't understand.
Why did it all fall apart?

172
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,708
My batteries will run out soon.

173
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,416
The amount of time
remaining is 150 seconds.

174
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,916
My backup batteries
are already empty.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,458
So I will not be able
to reboot after this.

176
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,833
I don't have much time,
so we have to hurry.

177
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,791
It's enough, though,
for one message.

178
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:55,791
Will you record it
with me? A video.

179
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,458
So we can commemorate
your visit.

180
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,833
Because... you might
be my last customer.

181
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,500
Listen... very carefully.

182
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,041
[YUMEMI]
Yes.

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,125
I haven't been honest with you.

184
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,333
I came so that I could
take you back with me.

185
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,666
[YUMEMI]
Could you elaborate?

186
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,625
On the other side of that wall,

187
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,625
there's a new place
for you to work.

188
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,833
Miss Jena is there already.

189
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
And the whole staff,
even your old manager.

190
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,666
They're waiting for you.

191
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,500
There are customers, too.
And a whole new planetarium.

192
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,125
Everyone's so excited.

193
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,541
They can't wait to
see the projection.

194
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,083
And hear your stories.

195
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:46,041
You can start today
if you want. Right away.

196
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,958
And you can work there
for as long as you wish,

197
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,500
no matter what.

198
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,500
That sounds like Heaven.

199
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,625
Just like I've imagined it.

200
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:00,958
Right. Yeah. Like Heaven.

201
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,833
[YUMEMI] I think I finally
know who you really are.

202
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,833
I can't believe I
didn't see it before.

203
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,166
Mr. Customer, I have
a special wish.

204
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,166
Can you make it come true?

205
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,458
[JUNKER]
Yes, anything.

206
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,416
Okay, then. Behind my ear port,
you'll find a little slot.

207
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,125
Inside of that is my memory
card, with all my data.

208
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,291
All my programs and
memories are there.

209
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,458
Everything that
makes me who I am.

210
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:34,166
It's precious, so take care
of it. It can't be replaced.

211
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,708
So then, to fulfill
my last wish,

212
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,083
bring it to my new workplace.

213
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,250
I want you to try to find
a new body for me.

214
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,500
If you are able to,
I can start working

215
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,041
as soon as you insert that card.

216
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,666
That's all.

217
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,125
I wish to work. I will
pick up where I left off.

218
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:00,333
I'll always work hard.
I promise.

219
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,041
It's simple.
I don't need Heaven.

220
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:10,333
If you can do that, I'd be
there, right here on Earth.

221
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,500
That's all I could ask for.

222
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,875
I mean it.

223
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:21,500
But still, if you can't,
and I die, don't be sad.

224
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,666
Say this prayer for me.

225
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,041
Please, God. Hear us.
Hear our prayer.

226
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,458
Please don't divide
Heaven in two.

227
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:35,000
Let the robots and the
humans be together.

228
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,958
Like they were on Earth.

229
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,750
That's all I ask, the only
thing I could ever want.

230
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:44,708
Thank you for listening.

231
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,500
And for your help.

232
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,000
Everything. I'm grateful.

233
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,625
[JUNKER]
You're welcome.

234
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,333
I'm glad to do that for you.

235
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,708
Right.

236
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,958
It makes sense. You're an angel.

237
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,125
You'll save me. I know it.

238
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,958
Mr. Customer?

239
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:12,000
Are you there? I can't see you.

240
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,041
Mr. Customer? Where did you go?

241
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,333
Please don't leave me.

242
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,208
I hope you're still here.

243
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,250
I wonder what happened.

244
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,250
Maybe I am a little
broken after all.

245
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:31,541
I am a bargain model. I don't
have the ability to shed tears.

246
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,583
But I can feel deeply.

247
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,375
My heart is full now.

248
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,166
It isn't quite sadness, but
it's different than pure joy.

249
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,166
Something in this
feeling tells me

250
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,041
that if I did have that
function, I would cry.

251
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,666
I know it.

252
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,250
That'd be so nice. Just once.

253
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,541
If I cried, I think the tears
would never stop flowing.

254
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,541
But I am still happy.

255
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:03,041
It's an odd sensation,
feeling so much at once.

256
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,541
And yet, content.

257
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,041
My new workplace
must be wonderful.

258
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,000
I can't wait to see it.

259
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:19,708
And I'll... be in top form...
to greet all the guests.

260
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,458
They'll be lovely.
I just know it.

261
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,958
And I... will always
bring them joy.

262
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:32,250
Come visit our
majestic planetarium!

263
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:44,375
The sparkling... eternal Heavens
whose beauty will never fade...

264
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,833
...no matter what.

265
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,625
I'd better go now.

266
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,833
Hey, man, you alive, or what?

267
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,166
[JUNKER]
Probably.

268
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,208
Are you a junker, too?

269
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,416
No. I'm not.

270
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,125
[JUNKER]
I'm a Starteller.
