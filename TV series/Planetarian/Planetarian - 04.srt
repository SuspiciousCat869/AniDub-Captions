1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,583
[YUMEMI] Why isn't there
anyone out here today?

2
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,416
It's pouring rain.

3
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,875
[JUNKER] Less than three
kilometers on foot.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,041
If I can slip by undetected,
I think I'll make it.

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,041
How much charge do you
have in your batteries?

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,250
Well, in my current
operational mode,

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,625
I estimate approximately
four days.

8
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,083
That's good. So you'll be
able to make it home?

9
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,666
Yes.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,791
You said your car is less than
three kilometers from the store,

11
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,333
and I am able to travel
distances within that range.

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,666
I'm glad. We'd better
get going, though.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, I understand.

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,125
[JUNKER]
Hey!

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,083
Please watch your step,
there's a bump right there.

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,208
[giggles]

17
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,083
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer, look.

18
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,750
This shop makes the best
vanilla cream puffs in the city.

19
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:18,458
The line for them is always out
the door every time I pass by.

20
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,125
Do you enjoy cream puffs?

21
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,041
I've been told that
most humans do.

22
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,791
I don't know. I've never had
a cream puff in my life.

23
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,833
Anyway, I could do without
your tour guide commentary.

24
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,000
We're in a hurry here.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,458
Yes, I will walk faster.

26
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,500
This place is great!

27
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,083
The fifth floor is a beer garden
which features selections

28
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,208
brewed right in our
department store!

29
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,625
They also offer a wide variety
of other local craft beers...

30
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,125
I don't wanna say it again.

31
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,416
I need you stop talking
and pick up the pace.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,791
Yes, sir. Order acknowledged.

33
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,583
[gasps]

34
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,500
[YUMEMI] I apologize,
but I have a request.

35
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,208
Do you need to take a break?

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, Mm femoral power
unit is overheating

37
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,666
and needs to cool down.

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,000
It should only take a moment.

39
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,416
[JUNKER]
How many stops does this make?

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,041
[YUMEMI]
This is the fourth one thus far.

41
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,125
[JUNKER]
And how far have we gotten?

42
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,625
[YUMEMI]
From the entrance to the store,

43
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,916
we have covered 1,112 meters.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,708
[JUNKER sighs]

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,458
Only one kilometer
per hour. Damn.

46
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,791
[YUMEMI] It doesn't look like
the rain will stop soon.

47
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
Yeah, you're right.

48
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,166
I enjoy the rain.

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,958
What about you, do you like it?

50
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,500
No, I hate it.

51
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,291
To each his own!

52
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,708
I would venture so far as
to say that rainy days

53
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,666
are my most favorite of all.

54
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,541
Because the planetarium gets
busier when it's raining?

55
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,250
Yes! That's exactly why!

56
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,875
I can't say I'm surprised.

57
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,458
Right.

58
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,458
The manager once told me that
people appreciate the stars more

59
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,750
when they can't see them,
so when the weather's bad,

60
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,458
they're drawn to the planetarium
and our projections!

61
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,875
I think that makes sense.

62
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,166
By the way, I hope you
don't mind my asking,

63
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,375
but what kind of
occupation do you have?

64
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,916
I'm a junker.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,083
What does that job entail?

66
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm not sure how to put it...

67
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,666
I guess you could call me
a garbage collector?

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh my goodness,
what a distinct honor!

69
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,833
Garbage collection is
a very noble vocation.

70
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,750
Just so you know, my design
was specifically engineered

71
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,750
to be 100% recyclable.

72
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,416
[JUNKER]
We should get moving again.

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,625
You ready?

74
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,041
Yes. Let's keep walking.

75
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,000
Why don't you leave that behind?

76
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,916
By "that," do you mean
the bouquet I made

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,875
to commemorate your arrival?

78
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,375
I do.

79
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,583
I think carrying it makes you
more likely to fall down.

80
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,958
It's yours.

81
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,291
I shouldn't discard
something which isn't mine.

82
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,791
Give it a rest!

83
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,000
Look, I'm sorry.

84
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,166
Let me carry it so you can walk.
We have to move faster.

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,250
[YUMEMI]
Yes.

86
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,250
That is better. I hope
it's not much trouble.

87
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,125
[JUNKER]
No, it's no trouble at all.

88
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,791
[YUMEMI]
I made it especially for you.

89
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,083
Thank you for accepting it.

90
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,916
Sure. I am a garbage
collector, after all.

91
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,541
[JUNKER gasps]

92
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,791
[JUNKER]
A liquor store.

93
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,041
I'm confused.

94
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,500
I don't understand what
happened to this place.

95
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,041
Is the damage here the
result of a car accident

96
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,750
or explosion of some kind?

97
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,666
It could be from combat
during the war,

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,666
but I have a hunch
it's more recent.

99
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,250
I bet another junker is
responsible for all this.

100
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,958
Then we should
report it immediately

101
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,916
to the proper authorities.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,541
[JUNKER]
Whoever did this is long gone.

103
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,666
You shouldn't worry.
They've been dealt with.

104
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,500
Right. I think I
understand what you mean.

105
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,083
They certainly did a number
on the joint, though.

106
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,625
You wait for me here.

107
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,041
Yes. I'll stay outside.

108
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,500
[JUNKER] Man, I finally
find a liquor store,

109
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,458
but it's been ransacked.

110
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,041
If only they'd been a
little less thorough.

111
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,708
It can't be!

112
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,958
Dying's easy.

113
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,833
The hard part is all
the life that happens

114
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:54,791
leading up to death.

115
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,291
What do you mean?

116
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,375
I was under the impression
you'd even survive a land mine.

117
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,250
You got that right.

118
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,958
[JUNKER]
Is this a trap?

119
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,458
If it's my time, there's
not much I can do about it.

120
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,708
I might as well take the risk.

121
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,833
I don't see any wires,
or a weight plate.

122
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,916
But it might be some kind of
trigger I haven't seen yet.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,083
[gasps]

124
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,625
Here you go.

125
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,458
After all the work I've done,
this doesn't feel like a payoff.

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,416
I believe that the
bottle you are holding

127
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,875
contains a middle-grade
Scotch Whisky.

128
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,833
It was aged 12 years in sherry
barrels. The price including--

129
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,208
You sure have a lot of
data stored up there.

130
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,875
It's pretty damn impressive.

131
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,500
[YUMEMI] Thank you.
I'm flattered you think so.

132
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,583
[JUNKER coughing]

133
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,375
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer, are you all right?

134
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,875
[JUNKER sighs]

135
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,666
[YUMEMI] Come visit our
majestic planetarium!

136
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
The sparkling, eternal Heavens,

137
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,958
whose beauty will never
fade, no matter what!

138
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,125
Why not come see for...

139
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,375
We're almost to
the quarantine wall.

140
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,833
Barring some unforeseen SNAFU,
I should get through safely.

141
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
[YUMEMI]
Mr. Customer.

142
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,833
Please watch your step as you
approach this obstruction.

143
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,416
It's dangerous.

144
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,625
[JUNKER]
This is the 14th time.

145
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,083
You're the one who needs to
watch where she's going.

146
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,583
Yes. Sorry I'm so clumsy.

147
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,625
[JUNKER]
How are you still in one piece?

148
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:48,208
I was constructed to be
much tougher than I look.

149
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,791
That's good.
This place is rough.

150
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,333
[YUMEMI]
Yes.

151
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,333
[YUMEMI] I've never seen the
streets this empty before.

152
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,375
Yeah. We're the only ones here.

153
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,833
[YUMEMI]
We're usually not allowed out

154
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,416
on rainy days like this.

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Sometimes it's boring,
being stuck inside.

156
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,208
But being indoors can be fun

157
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,333
if you're with someone
whose company you enjoy.

158
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,583
Must get old. Don't you
ever get stir crazy?

159
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,500
Sorry, I don't understand
what you're asking.

160
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,833
[JUNKER]
You've worked in the planetarium

161
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,125
for a long time, haven't you?

162
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,125
You've gotta wonder what else is
out there every once in a while.

163
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,708
I am actually very content

164
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,791
to be working in
the planetarium.

165
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,291
You have to understand that
the manager, Miss Jena,

166
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,833
and the others who
work with me there

167
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,666
are the closest thing I have
to what humans call a family.

168
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,666
I get that.

169
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,875
Pardon, Mr. Customer?

170
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,416
There's something I've been
wanting to ask about.

171
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,416
What is it?

172
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
I was wondering,

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,875
have you ever wanted something
so much you prayed to God?

174
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,458
In my desperate moments.

175
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,208
Not in the way that
you mean, though.

176
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,208
Speaking of which, you
never finished telling me

177
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,875
what you'd ask your god for.

178
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,250
Yes. I would like to tell you.

179
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,375
Well, out with it, then.

180
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,166
[YUMEMI]
Right, here goes.

181
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,666
I would ask my god not
to divide Heaven in two.

182
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,541
I can't think of
anything else I'd want

183
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,583
that only the god of
robots could give.

184
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,458
I don't want people and robots
to be sorted separately

185
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,541
at the gates of Heaven.

186
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,125
Nothing could possibly
make me sadder.

187
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,958
Heaven wouldn't be paradise
if I had to exist there

188
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,833
without serving humans.

189
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,791
I was created to
bring people joy,

190
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,583
and that's all I
wanna do, forever.

191
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,041
Really?

192
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,666
Yes. Absolutely!

193
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,541
[JUNKER] If I just leave her
here, her batteries will die.

194
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,625
I could make her wish come true,

195
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,208
but to do that I'd have to
get her out of the city.

196
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,208
I know she won't go
against her will.

197
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,583
I only hope that I
can convince her.

198
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,250
Shall we walk now?

199
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,875
How much farther do we have
to go to reach your car?

200
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,000
[JUNKER]
Oh. Not very far.

201
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,666
I'm happy to hear that!

202
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,583
Then we should be on our way.

203
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,333
[JUNKER]
Yeah.

204
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,208
[JUNKER sighs]

205
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,708
[JUNKER]
How dumb.

206
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,291
I must've had a little
too much whisky.

207
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,708
[JUNKER] No. I was drunk long
before I found that bottle.

208
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,666
It began the moment I set foot
in her sparkling little world.

209
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,125
You'd be better off ignoring it.

210
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,166
No matter how much it talks.

211
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,708
Is something wrong?

212
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,875
[JUNKER]
No, nothing. Let's go.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,291
[JUNKER] What am I supposed
to do? What'll happen to her?

214
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,000
[grumbles]

215
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,291
[YUMEMI] The streets here don't
look anything like they should,

216
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,833
according to the coordinates
in my database.

217
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,500
Have they been
reconstructed recently?

218
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,958
The war has rebuilt them.

219
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,125
Also, is that giant
machine over there

220
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,416
a new kind of
construction robot?

221
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,958
Not exactly. It's
called a Fiddler Crab.

222
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,833
Can you please elaborate?

223
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,875
It's a robot, similar
to you in a way.

224
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,166
[JUNKER]
Why is it there,

225
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,208
in front of the quarantine
wall, of all places?

226
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,958
Do I even have a chance?

227
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,750
What's wrong? Is
something the matter?

228
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,416
I'm going hunting.

229
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,958
Really? What are
you hunting for?

230
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,583
I want you to stay right
here until I come back.

231
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,875
We're almost to my car,
and I'm leaving the city.

232
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,416
I won't be returning.

233
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,833
What will you do after I'm gone?

234
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,208
Oh.

235
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,208
Don't worry, I know the way
back to the planetarium,

236
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,250
and I have enough
battery to get there.

237
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,416
There's no one
left in this city.

238
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,958
Even if you did make it back,

239
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,125
no customers will ever shop
at that department store again.

240
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,750
The electrical stream
is cut off, don't you see?

241
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,708
That projector is never
going to operate,

242
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,958
so there's no reason
for you to go back there.

243
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
Yes.

244
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,250
But according to the
statistical information

245
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,000
I have analyzed
from my database,

246
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,666
there is a high probability
that customers will return

247
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,083
to the store eventually.

248
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,083
As for the power outage,
both Miss Jena and myself

249
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,458
are willing to wait for
electricity to resume,

250
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,708
no matter how long it takes.

251
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,875
[JUNKER]
Listen!

252
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,916
Forget all about
statistics and databases,

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,208
and just listen to me.

254
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,333
Yes. I will listen.

255
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,750
You saw the city.

256
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,958
It's nothing but wreckage

257
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,083
and there's not a single
living person left.

258
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,291
This god forsaken place
will never need you

259
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,375
or that planetarium again!

260
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,041
If serving humans
is what you want,

261
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,083
then you only have one choice.

262
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
You have to get out of here.

263
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,125
You told me about
your idea of Heaven,

264
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,125
and you can have that if
you want it, I promise.

265
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,708
So please, come with me.

266
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,625
[YUMEMI] I wish to serve humans
more than anything in the world,

267
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,916
I know that much for certain.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,291
It's true. I find my
happiness by theirs.

269
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,375
However, at this time, I don't
believe I have sufficient data

270
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,000
to make an informed decision
based on the empirical evidence.

271
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,750
There is no way for you to
get any more information.

272
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,541
Think about it.

273
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,333
[JUNKER] You're going to have to
decide by the time I get back.

274
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,625
Yes, I understand that.

275
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,541
All right. And hold on to
this while I'm out there.

276
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,958
Yes. I promise to watch
it carefully for you.

277
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,583
Remember, do not move
or say a single word.

278
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,000
Sit here quietly. No matter
what you may see or hear.

279
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:49,625
Right. This has been registered
as a critical directive.

280
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,791
I will be eagerly
awaiting your return.

281
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,041
[JUNKER] A charging station
would be expensive,

282
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,958
but it's not
impossible to get one.

283
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,250
I think I could build
her a small projector.

284
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,083
That wouldn't be too hard.

285
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,750
We could take it to
all of the colonies,

286
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,416
projecting the starry sky
and the history of humanity

287
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,583
and space while she narrated.

288
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,166
It could be our new line of
work. A much better one.

289
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,250
Who am I kidding?

290
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,833
[JUNKER]
Sorry, buddy.

291
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,833
But there's only room for
one robot around here.

292
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,708
What the hell?
