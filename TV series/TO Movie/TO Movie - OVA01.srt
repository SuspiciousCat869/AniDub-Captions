1
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,250
[DAN] The comet
Crommelin, 27P...

2
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:58,833
First observed by astronomers in
the early nineteenth century...

3
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,333
It cuts a wide elliptical orbit,

4
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,791
around the sun and deep
into our solar system...

5
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:09,000
A twenty-eight year revolution
through the cosmos.

6
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,375
Its infinite journey last
brought it past Earth

7
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,250
in Two Thousand Sixty-Eight...

8
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,875
And it won't pass again for
another twenty eight years.

9
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:24,625
An insignificant blink of time
in the span of its existence...

10
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,916
But I doubt my aging eyes
will open wide enough

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,916
to see it again.

12
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,750
[COMPUTER] Loading
the firing charge...

13
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,833
Firing.

14
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,375
Transport container...

15
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,708
B-Three-Seven-One...

16
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,666
on standby...

17
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,541
Loading of firing
charge complete.

18
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,375
[RICK] Midnight Bazooka calling
Moon Base Seven Five Five...

19
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,583
Come in, Moon Base.

20
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,166
[MOON BASE] Go ahead,
Midnight Bazooka.

21
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,666
[RICK] Container
B-Three-Seven-One comin' at ya'.

22
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,916
[MOON BASE] Roger that.

23
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,166
[COMPUTER] Seven...

24
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,166
Loading, of firing
charge, complete.

25
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,083
Three... Two... One...

26
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541
Fire.

27
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,791
[COMPUTER]
Launch successful...

28
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,750
Ventilate firing chamber...

29
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,583
Container B-Three-Seven-One
in flight

30
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,583
and headed for moon orbit.

31
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,666
Course is normal.

32
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,125
[RICK sighs]

33
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
An' there she goes,
off to the moon.

34
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,333
[DAN] Rick.

35
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,875
Make sure you send
them confirmation

36
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,708
that the launch was successful.

37
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,041
[RICK] I'm on it...

38
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,916
Come in, Moon Base...
This is Midnight Bazooka.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,916
Well that's
the last of 'em.

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,166
[MARK] Chief...?

41
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,375
Didn't they call in a
rush job this morning?

42
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,541
Oh, yeah.

43
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,583
[MARK] Should be
showin' up anytime now.

44
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,750
Right. Go ahead and
prep the catapult

45
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,625
and we'll fire it off
as soon as it gets here.

46
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,000
[RICK] You got it, boss.

47
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,583
Oh, man... I am ready
for some R&amp;R tomorrow!

48
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,125
[MARK chuckles]

49
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,416
[DAN chuckles]

50
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,125
[CREWMAN 2] Hey, chief.

51
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,166
We've got an urgent docking
request from Earth base.

52
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,541
That's kinda' weird.

53
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,041
What ship is it?

54
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,250
[CREWMAN 2] Ship code Zero
Seven Eight Nine Six Two E-K...

55
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,791
The Flying Dutchman.

56
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,333
They need to stop for repairs
before atmospheric reentry.

57
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,916
[RICK] The Flying Dutchman?
Never heard of it.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,833
[MARK] It's practically
a ghost ship...

59
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,666
Resurfaces once
every fifteen years.

60
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,333
[RICK] Oh...

61
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,333
Man, so they were all the way
out in Alpha Centauri, huh?

62
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,500
You think the proton mining
worked out this time?

63
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,916
Man, if it did,
that would be like

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,458
the biggest news to
hit Earth in a century!

65
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,125
[RICK] They'd deserve one
hell of a homecoming...

66
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,041
That's for sure.

67
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,166
Chief?

68
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,375
Yeah...

69
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,958
You should go ahead and
start preping a dock.

70
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,916
A ship like that's
gotta be ancient...

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,333
You sure we got all
the parts on hand?

72
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
We should be fine, but
maybe we shoulda stocked up

73
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,083
on older parts after working
on that French shuttle, huh?

74
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,166
Heh. Yeah, no kiddin'.

75
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:53,208
[DAN sighs]

76
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,250
Go ahead and get
started on replacing

77
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,583
that main nozzle for me, Willie.

78
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,083
You got it, boss.

79
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,958
[HAYES] I can't believe we're
stuck this close to Earth.

80
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,375
Aw, quit bitchin'.
It's a direct order from HQ.

81
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,791
[MARIA] And they're right about
the condition of the ship.

82
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,958
You in such a big hurry

83
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,291
you'd risk burning up
in the atmosphere?

84
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,250
I'll get started on
the fuel injector.

85
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,875
[MARIA gasps]

86
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,375
So their cargo bay is loaded
with liquid proton, right?

87
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,875
That's level five
classification, so...

88
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,583
how the hell would I know?

89
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,166
[RICK] Hm.

90
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Although, considering that
they were ordered to stop

91
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,708
for these repairs
before reentry...

92
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,416
it's a pretty safe bet.

93
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,625
Man, that crew's gonna be
famous once they get back.

94
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,000
Too bad their captain's the only
one who's got the looks for it.

95
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,583
[RICK laughs]

96
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,666
[MARIA] This is Horn,

97
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,500
the second planet of
the Alpha Centauri system.

98
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,708
It may look like a barren
wasteland, but it's far from it.

99
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,416
We dropped a subterranean
droid in 2020

100
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
and realized it's
a treasure trove.

101
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,583
Anyway, we put the
drilling robots to work

102
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,333
on our first voyage...
and we actually didn't finish

103
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,583
building the mining plant
until the second trip.

104
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,208
So this last trip was the
first time we were able to

105
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,250
finally reap the
rewards of our labor.

106
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,833
I thought so...

107
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,541
Nine tons...

108
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,583
That much proton would
provide the earth

109
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,458
with enough power to
last ten years at least.

110
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,583
And it's only
the beginning.

111
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,916
Cheers...
To our reunion.

112
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,333
To your success...

113
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,416
You gave up your life
to pursue this expedition.

114
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,291
It's good to see
that it's paying off.

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,833
[MARIA sighs]

116
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,916
Fifteen years...

117
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,291
I'm actually surprised
to see you here.

118
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,958
I didn't think this kind
of life appealed to you.

119
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:19,291
I feel more at home in space
than I do on Earth these days...

120
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,333
So that's the mining
plant on Horn, is it?

121
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,333
[MARIA] That's right.

122
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,291
How's Tokio doing?

123
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,541
I bet he turned out
even taller than you.

124
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,125
Tokio passed away.

125
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,166
[MARIA gasps]

126
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,958
[DAN] He chose to
become a soldier.

127
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,875
He was killed five years
ago in the African War.

128
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,583
[DAN] Don't even start.

129
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,375
It's too late for you
to act like you care.

130
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,583
You made a decision
a long time ago...

131
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,041
and you chose space over
a life with me and my son.

132
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,208
My wife also died last year.

133
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,208
So once again the
only person I've got...

134
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,041
...is myself.

135
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,625
And now you're officially
caught up on my life.

136
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,250
[MARIA] Dan.

137
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,750
Do you still hate me
for leaving you?

138
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,083
I guess I'm a cruel
woman... Aren't I?

139
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,208
[beeping]

140
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,750
[MARK] Chief...

141
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,958
The shuttle delivering that
last-minute job is on approach.

142
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,250
We need you in the control room.

143
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,458
[DAN] Roger that.
I'm heading up.

144
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,791
[DAN] It's life that's
cruel, not you.

145
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,791
But if you want to feel
responsible for my troubles,

146
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:18,208
then go ahead... I guess
you still have that right.

147
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,000
[COMPUTER]
Shuttle is approaching.

148
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,625
[RICK] Loading dock open...

149
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,791
Prepare to receive
container B-Four-Oh-Four.

150
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,041
[COMPUTER] Systems, normal.

151
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,041
Loading, normal.

152
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,625
[RICK] Auto-control's set
on the cargo loading arms.

153
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,541
[COMPUTER] Retrieving,
container, B-Four-Oh-Four.

154
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,875
Stand by.

155
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,166
Quit wasting
your breath.

156
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,875
My mind is already made up.

157
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,750
You're sure about this?

158
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,333
[TOKIO] Mm.

159
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,500
[MARK] Chief.

160
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,583
[MARK] Chief?

161
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
[DAN] Hm?

162
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,375
Looks like We got that cargo

163
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,708
successfully secured
in the dock.

164
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,375
Good...

165
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,333
Call in the load report to
ground control, got that?

166
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,333
[RICK] Yes, sir.

167
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,416
[DAN] Mark, take watch
over the bridge.

168
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,125
I'll be in my cabin.

169
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,291
Sure thing, chief.

170
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,416
[MARIA sighs]

171
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,291
[MARIA] What the hell
are you doing in here?

172
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,083
[WILLIE laughs]

173
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,916
It's my turn tonight, y'know...

174
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,875
Don't tell me that you forgot.

175
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,791
[WILLIE laughs]

176
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,166
[WILLIE] Ooh!

177
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,291
Hey!

178
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,208
Hey now...

179
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,375
--[MARIA] Go!
--Put that down.

180
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,583
[MARIA]
Get out of here!

181
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,916
Didn't I tell you to
replace the main nozzle?

182
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,208
[WILLIE scoffs and laughs]

183
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,625
[WILLIE] Why do you
think I'm here?

184
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,250
Just shut up...
I don't feel like it tonight!

185
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,583
Aww, why not? Usually--

186
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,666
I'm just not in
the mood tonight!

187
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,750
Not here, okay?

188
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,458

[WILLIE sighs]

194
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,166
Geez... What the hell's
gotten into her?

195
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,500
Hey! Wait a second.

196
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,041
[WILLIE laughs]

197
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,875
Didn't the captain stop by your
quarters a little while ago?

198
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,416
I think I figured out what's
gotten into her after all...

199
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,291
Well?

200
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,250
It's nothing to
be ashamed of...

201
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,541
We all get a little lonesome
in space sometimes...

202
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,833
So it only makes sense that us
little cowboys and cowgirls...

203
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,666
...trade mounts.

204

[WILLIE grunts]

207
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,833
[WILLIE] Come on,
Hayes, get a move on.

208
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,958
I don't want any more shit
from the captain today.

209
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,500
Don't just stand there, moron.

210
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,000
[COMPUTER] Loading

One hundred percent...

212
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,583
Almost done, and then
we get that sweet day off.

213
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah...

214
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,000
I was startin' to get kinda
worried we were gonna lose it.

215
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,791
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER]
Don't move!

216
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,166
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER] Stay
calm and do exactly as I say.

217
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,333
Now...

218
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,541
...tell me where
your captain is.

219
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,333
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER]
Two through Five,

220
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,166
search the private quarters.

221
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,958
Kill anyone who tries
to get in your way.

222
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,416
[MARK] None of
our men are armed.

223
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,791
What could you hope to get

224
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,708
out of taking over a cargo
station, huh? What do you want?

225
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,916
[laughs]

226

[rapid knocking at door]

[MARIA] Jesus Christ!
For the last time, no!

228
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,666
[MARIA gasps]

[typing]

230
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,416
What's wrong?
What's going on?

231
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,666
[MARK] What...?!
Are you completely nuts?!

232
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,125
[MARK] You want to load a ton
of proton into a container

233
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,875
and fire it at the moon base?

234
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,250
[MARK] This is insane!

235
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,208
Do you even realize what'll
happen if you do that?

236
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,958
So much for savin'
the world, huh?

237
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,541
Listen to me.

238
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,291
There's more than three hundred
thousand people on that base...

239
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,125
Are you trying to kill them all?

240
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,708
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER] That's
not even close to the lives

241
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:57,375
we lose from hunger
everyday on my continent.

242
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,041
And despite how many
are starving on Earth,

243
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:05,375
you send an endless barrage
of supplies to the moon.

244
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,541
We lost the African War
five years ago...

245
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,583
But the real fight
has just begun.

246
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,291
We plan on winning this time.

247
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:18,333
So you can consider this
our declaration of war.

248
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,916
The remaining proton will
return with us, of course...

249
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,666
It has infinite potential
for military use.

250
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,166
[MARIA] No way in hell...!

251
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,458
Those bastards aren't gonna
use my life's work for this!

252
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,166
We can try to
alert the moon base

253
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,000
to arm their
missile system.

254
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,791
But even if they
can intercept it

255
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,041
from six thousand miles away...

256
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,875
It's likely the blast
from the proton

257
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:43,083
will completely
decimate the base.

258
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,625

Take your team to the dock!

282
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,541
[MARIA] What's wrong with you?!

283
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:41,083
Did you just completely
remove the main nozzle?!

284
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
Yeah and I was just
about to replace it...

285
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,500
...but I took an
unexpected nap instead.

286

[MARIA] Dammit, Willie...

287
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,500
The ship's boosters
are paralyzed

288
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,000
without the main nozzle.

289
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,375
Which means it's the four
of us against them

290
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,958
and the only weapons we have

291
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,625
are the two lasers we got off
those guys and my hand laser.

292
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,833
Try pointing the deep
space antenna array

293
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,083
at the loading dock.

294
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,666
What for?

295
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,375
So we'll hit them with a burst
of electromagnetic radiation...

00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,458
Releasing locks!

297
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,041
Fire it up, Willie! Now!

[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER]
That's as far as you get.

302
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,166
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER] Now...

303
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,125
Before you make
another stupid move,

304
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,166
you should know that the
container we rode in on

305
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,250
is loaded with explosives.

306
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,958
And there's more than enough
to trigger the liquid proton

307
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,750
and destroy this entire station.

308
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,791
And guess what I happen
to be holding...?

309
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:39,083
The detonator to the explosives.

310
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,750
Ha, ha, ha...

311
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,666
Their ship's engines
are inactive.

312
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,916
We'll cut away the tank
carrying the proton.

313
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,416
Concentrate your fire on
the connecting locks...

314
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,958
Whatever you do,
don't shoot the tank.

315
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,875
Open fire!

316
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,208
Oh, shit...

are severed...

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,250

What do you think
you're doing?

321
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,166
Don't act like you
don't know. Heh.

322
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,625
I love you...

323
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,958
Both of you.

324
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,750
What are you doing?

325
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,875
We're going out to
release the valves.

326
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,916
I'd rather see all that
proton dumped into space

327
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,541
before I'd let them
get their hands on it.

328
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,666
[MARIA] You're not coming.

329
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,666
We've only got three weapons

330
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,625
and they're armed to the teeth.

331
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,541
You have other loyalties.

332
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,750
Your first responsibility
is to your crew.

333
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:06,125
You really think you can stop
them with just the three of you?

334
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,833
[beeping]

335
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,625
[MARK] Chief! We overpowered
the guards and got their guns.

336
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,541
What are your orders?

337
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,208
Chief!

338
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,083
[MARK] Chief!

339
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,083
[MARK] Captain,
we need your orders!

340
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,583
Mark, the rush-job
container B-Four-Oh-Four

341
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:40,833
is loaded with explosives.

342
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,250
I love you... Dan.

343
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,000
Charge the catapult and
get that container loaded...

344
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,375
Launch it ASAP!

345
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,958
[WILLIE grunts]

346
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,416
[WILLIE] Bastards!

347
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,833
If you think you can just
fly in and take our stuff

348
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,208
without an ass kicking,

349
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,375
you've got another thing coming!

350
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,208
[SPACE TERRORIST 3 yells]

351
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,666
[SPACE TERRORIST 4] Ahh!

352
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,541
[SPACE TERRORIST 12 yells]

353
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,500
[HAYES] Ah!

354
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,625
[HAYES grunts]

355
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,125
Hayes!

356
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,875
No...

357
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,208
Maria, just go!

358
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,000
Willie!

359
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,791
Get moving!

360
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:06,875
[WILLIE screams]

361
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,541
[SPACE TERRORIST 14] Ah!

362
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,583
[WILLIE] Ahhh! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

363
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,458
[SPACE TERRORIST 13 yells]

364
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,833
[WILLIE laughs]

365
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,083
[WILLIE] Ah!

366
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,458
Willie!

367
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,166
Sorry...

368
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,500
Damn you-- [gasps]

369
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,625
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER]
Don't move.

370
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,125
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER]
Don't even look at that valve.

371
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,833
Dan! Don't do it!

372
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,000
[MARIA] Baby, no!

373
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:17,791
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER screams]

374
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,875
[COMPUTER] Loading of
firing charge complete.

375
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:28,666
Three... Two... One...

376
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,541
Fire.

377
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,875
[SPACE TERRORIST LEADER yells]

378
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,208
[GROUP cheers]

379
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,750
[DAN] Without their
leader to guide them,

380
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,458
the remaining terrorists
simply surrendered.

381
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,291
The majority of
the liquid proton

382
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,875
was safely delivered to Earth.

383
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,291
You know, Dad...

384
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,500
I think I understand
how she must've felt.

385
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,166
Love...?

386
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,250
It shouldn't be something
that holds you back.

387
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:54,208
He was right.
That's how I felt.

388
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,291
It must be genetic.

389
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:06,208
[DAN] So... another
fifteen years, huh?

390
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,083
[MARIA] And thirteen
of those years

391
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:11,416
I'll be asleep in a
hibernation capsule.

392
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:16,291
[DAN] Which means you'll
only age another two years.

393
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,833
After forty-five years...

394
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,666
I'm still not used to it.

395
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,666
You were right earlier.

396
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,416
You are a cruel woman.

397
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,000
Good luck...

398
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,958
Wait for me, Baby.

399
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,625
Good luck.

400
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,916
[DAN] And once again,

401
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,791
she vanishes into the timeless
vacuum of the deepest cosmos...

402
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:56,333
Just like a comet following
its long elliptical orbit.

403
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,541
Or like a sudden memory

404
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:03,083
that fades before
I can clearly see it.

405
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:07,958
Leaving me alone, once more,
in its nebulous wake.

406
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,791
[DAN] Good luck
to you... Mother.
