1
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,500
[NARRATOR] It has been 27 years
since humankind's "Great Leap."

2
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,750
Interstellar travel
has opened a doorway

3
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,458
to the reaches beyond
our Solar System...

4
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,583
to deep space...

5
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,583
Thus far we have explored
over 18 unique star systems

6
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:07,250
and traveled over ninety
light-years from home.

7
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,416
Back on Earth, the global
wounds from the Austral Wars

8
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,291
are slow to heal, as humanity
faces the bleak reality

9
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,416
of existence in a Solar System,

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,666
whose resources are
rapidly depleting.

11
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,416
Now, in the
twenty-second century,

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,250
humankind has a
newfound purpose:

13
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,208
the exploration of
new worlds to inhabit

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,125
and the establishment
of trade routes

15
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,250
to resupply the dying Earth.

16
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,458
[SNAUT] Arbiter Lange...

17
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,166
[LANGE] Ahh...

18
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,291
This "hyperspace travel"
certainly does

19
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,583
make me feel my age.

20
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,000
Such an unpleasant sensation...

21
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,125
How you young space faring types
tolerate it the way you do,

22
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,541
I'll never understand.

23
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,708
Well... it's a small
price to pay,

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,375
for traveling twenty-four
light years in five hours.

25
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,625
[SNAUT] There she is:
Beta Hydri...

26
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,458
Beta star of the
Hydrus constellation...

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,791
Spectral type: G2-IV.

28
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,833
Magnitude: two-point-eight...

29
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,125
Fifteen planets in orbit...

30
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,958
Our destination
lies on the fifth.

31
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:09,125
[Great Birnams vocalize]

32
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,916
[ALINA] Ion.

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,541
[ION] Alina.

34
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,583
[ALINA] Looks like you
managed to train a Piccard.

35
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,958
[ION] I figured out that they
use thermal air currents

36
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,583
to help them find
new grazing areas.

37
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,666
[ALINA] Ah, so they
show intelligence.

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,166
[ION] Mm-hmm.

39
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,041
And look at this.

40
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,083
Do you see that
mold-like substance

41
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,875
growing all over its body?

42
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, it turns out that it's
actually a type of fungus...

43
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,541
It feeds on the Piccard's waste
excretions, and in the process,

44
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,000
it breaks down moisture from the
air into hydrogen and oxygen.

45
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,416
[ALINA] Interesting...

46
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,958
Which is why the Piccard
doesn't need lungs to breathe.

47
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,166
[ION] Exactly, plus the
hydrogen makes it light enough

48
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,958
to sail anywhere it wants.

49
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,375
It's remarkable...

50
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,291
[ION] It's called symbiosis--

51
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,583
two organisms that need
each other to survive.

52
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,916
It's quite common...

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,708
This planet is full of examples.

54
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:31,416
[Great Birnams vocalize]

55
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,791
[ION] There. Just take

slogging through a hyperbaric
sea of carbon dioxide...

57
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,750
They couldn't survive without
the trees on their backs

58
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,750
feeding them oxygen.

hold me without
this suit sometime.

I promise you I will...

63
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,000
Our survey here
is nearly complete.

64
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,000
[ION] Alright, so...

00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,666
Yes.

[ION] You got a problem,
Major Beltin?

71

I've got enough diplomatic
headaches on this rock

72
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,333
without any extra help from you.

73
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,791
Word is the tension
back on Earth

74
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,750
is getting worse every day.

start another godamn war.

that Eurasion again

and you're dead, alright?

00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,666
That a threat?

Military guys like you who
try to control everything.

If you want to have
yourself another war...

84
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
you can do it without me.

I can't believe you're serious.

Are we going to
have a problem?

89

Because you can
always just leave.

I suppose you could make
this a lot simpler...

91
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,416
Of course that would mean

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,208
telling me where you're
going every night.

placating the radicals

just so we could
start this dialogue.

that looks like a balloon?

163
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,833
[SNAUT] I've been told
it's something akin

164
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,125
to an evolved jellyfish.

165
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,416
[LANGE] Ahh... Heh, heh.

166
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,833
[SNAUT] Though normally
they're only found

167
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,125
in the hyperbaric sea.

168
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,791
Commander,

169
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,958
the United Nations reps
are now on station with us.

170
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,666
Be right with them...

171
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,750
Is there anything new to report
with the sealed off laboratory?

172
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,750
[BELTIN] No sir.

173
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,666
We still can't
get a look inside.

174
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,833
[MEYER] At least the spores
have been contained.

175
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,833
[BELTIN] We should be careful
that this doesn't slip out

176
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,416
in front of the UN delegation.

177
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,166
I know.

178
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,666
It's of the utmost importance

179
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,666
that we keep this
matter classified...

180
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,875
We don't need to give the
Eurasians any leverage.

181
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,541
[MEYER] Welcome, Arbiter Lange.

182
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm the base CO, Kurt Meyer.

183
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,666
You must be tired
from your journey.

184
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,666
[LANGE] Not at all.

185
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,625
Our voyage was most pleasant.

186
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,625
May I introduce
Arbiter Snaut?

187
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,291
How do you do?

188
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,500
[BELTIN] This starfish looking
creature has coral growing on it

189
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,916
that actually serves
as a protective armor.

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,958
Tests show that it's
as hard as ceramic.

191
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,875
Clearing all these little
guys out of the area

192
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,375
was not an easy job.

193
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,791
[BELTIN laughs]

194
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,583
[LANGE gasps]

195
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,083
[BELTIN] Here's where we
store the mineral samples.

196
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,833
If you're looking to
establish a resource colony,

197
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,958
you won't find a planet
better suited than this.

198
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,208
This settlement is one of the
first with the potential to

199
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,791
prove the benefit of
deep space colo--

200
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,208
Mr. Snaut, get away
from that door!

201
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,125
Excuse me...

202
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,625
The fungus we're culturing
in there is highly sensitive.

203
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,875
Colonel Medvedeva, our CO,

204
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,708
and our XO, Major Guerin,
are both here...

205
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,583
but object to negotiating
in English at this time.

206
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,333
So I will be speaking
instead on their behalf.

207
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,125
Developing any colony
takes time and consistency.

208
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,250
With that in mind we present
our five year plan to you.

209
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,125
Our first priority will
be to eliminate the fungi

210
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,666
and other harmful organisms
currently infesting

211
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,625
the Europa Plateau. After that,
we can reclaim the land

212
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,541
for expanded settlement
and food production.

213
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,791
Water supply will
not be a concern.

214
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,666
It is abundant beneath
the bedrock there,

215
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,916
so there will be
plenty for irrigation.

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,666
As you know, the water will
have to be purged anyway,

217
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,916
so as not to hinder any
future mining operations.

218
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,083
Our proposal is to drill
seven pumps at various depths

219
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,208
to move the water into the
north sector's marsh area,

220
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,625
creating a suitable reservoir.

221
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,041
This becomes the cornerstone
of our irrigation plan.

222
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,333
We will create several
artificial rivers

223
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,791
leading out from the reservoir.

224
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,083
They will become the
new Volgas and Rheins

225
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,750
on this developing world.

226
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,166
New rivers, huh...?

227
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,958
That's fine...

228
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,791
...if you want borders.

229
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,583
We don't have to put up
with this crap!

230
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,208
For what... This is
obviously just a ploy!

231
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,958
An attempt to skew the division
of land in your favor!

232
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,625
There's still much we have
to learn about this world.

233
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,541
If we carelessly start
making drastic changes,

234
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,166
it could have profound effects
on the local ecosystem.

235
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,958
[whispering]
Ko... koa nova sem.

236
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,416
Water at our colony
is insufficient.

237
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,083
The reserves
cannot sustain us.

238
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,125
The reservoir is
critical for us.

239
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
Your concerns are not ours.

240
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,583
Ee baja goja dis
butdojuvus rojuvus seeboo!

241
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,375
If you will not
support our plan...

242
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,666
...then we've no choice.

243
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,875
We will begin terraforming
independently...

244
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,666
...by force if we have to.

245
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,958
Oh is that so...?
How dare you threaten us!

246
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,458
[GUERIN sighs]

247
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:20,000
[beeping]

248
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,916
Ah. 'Scuse me...

249
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,208
It seems it's time for me
to take my heart medicine.

250
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,166
[LANGE chuckles]

251
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,583
[TATIANA] Hmm...

252
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,166
In any case,

253
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,166
we're here because neither of
your groups has the resources

254
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,250
to develop the entire
planet on your own.

255
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,250
So perhaps we can
take a break...

256
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,833
then we'll hear what
the other colony's ideas are

257
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,291
on the matter, okay?

258
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
[SNAUT sighs]

259
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
Piccard...

260
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,708
I can not think of
anywhere Ion could be.

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,583
[SNAUT] Is it good,
Arbiter Lange?

262
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,291
You enjoy your heart medicine
more than most people.

263
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,958
It's a twenty-one
hundred Bordeaux...

264
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,541
Of course it's good.

265
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,708
[LANGE chuckles]

266
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,875
[SNAUT] They're
fighting over water.

267
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,416
Is this why we started
traveling the stars?

268
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,625
I hate to admit it,

269
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,833
but humans could
start a war anywhere.

270
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,750
It's always the same.

271
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,708
You try to have a
reasonable discussion

272
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,208
but nobody wants to listen.

273
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,916
Things have a way
of working out...

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,875
they always do.

275
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,000
[SNAUT] I feel like
people will never change.

276
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,000
It's like we're some
kind of pathogen...

277
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,458
We sickened our host, the earth,

278
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,000
until it could
barely sustain life.

279
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,375
Then we journeyed out into
the galaxy in search of

280
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,666
a new host to whom we
could attach ourselves.

281
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,833
Heh...

282
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,208
Not so different from
spores on the wind...

283
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,958
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

284
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,000
[LANGE] I'm not so sure...

285
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,708
You seem to be
suggesting that we humans

286
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,875
leave some permanent
mark wherever we go.

287
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:41,333
Pride and youth have you
thinking we matter either way.

288
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,208
Ion was the one who
told you to find me?

289
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,666
I'm sorry I had to wake
you so late for this.

290
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,041
[beep]

291
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,791
Here he is...

292
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,166
Why's he in
there all alone?

293
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,166
[ION] Alina!
I'm so glad you're here.

294
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,875
Ion! You are okay...

295
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,708
I didn't know if I'd ever
get to see you again.

296
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,583
Open the door.

297
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,041
[ION ] I can't.

298
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,000
Why not?

299
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:24,291
[ION] Alina, listen carefully
and try to stay calm...

300
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,000
In this planet's atmosphere...

301
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,500
there's some sort
of parasitic fungus.

302
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,750
The spores became airborne
and contaminated me.

303
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,958
If you open the door
they'll be able to spread

304
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:41,458
throughout the whole colony...
including you.

305
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,958
Just hold on...

306
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,000
Is it hurting you?

307
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,916
[ION] It did at first, but the
pain went away pretty quickly.

308
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,916
I've done some
preliminary tests...

309
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,375
and my body appears to
be perfectly healthy.

310
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,916
Then let me in...

311
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,583
The spores aren't having
any effect on you.

312
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:02,208
[ION] Not yet...
It's too early to be certain.

313
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,333
[ALINA] You can't just
stay locked in there...

314
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,750
...like you're some
kind of lab animal...

315
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,708
[ION] Don't worry
about me, Alina...

316
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,625
[ALINA sobs]

317
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,041
As soon as I can prove
the spores are harmless,

318
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,291
I am getting out of here.

319
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,791
I promise...

320
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,541
Listen to me.
I'm going to be alright.

321
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,625
[MICHAEL] That's long enough...

322
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,500
If the military catches us here,
we'll all be in trouble.

323
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,208
We gotta go.

324
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,333
Let me walk you back, okay?

325
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,416
Come on.

326
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,666
[ION] Try and get
some sleep, okay.

327
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,708
Good night.

328
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,541
Ion...

329
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,083
[MEYER] This is pointless.

330
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,875
We're getting nowhere.

331
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,708
[BELTIN] You know
those Eurasians...

332
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,583
They aren't going change
their position on this.

333
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,375
Then the first move
is left up to us.

334
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,916
Before it's too late
to do anything.

335
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,166
[alarm sounds]

336

Report. What happened?

337
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,208
[MICHAEL] Someone
compromised the lab door.

338
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,458
The airtight seal
has been breached.

339
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:42,000
I've raised the colony
quarantine to Level C.

340
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,791
I think you should put on your
environment suit, just in case.

341
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,583
Damn.

342
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,458
[panicked screams]

343
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,916
Now what could
be the problem?

344
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,458
[BELTIN] No,
it's not hostiles...

345
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,250
this was the work
of our "guests."

346
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,166
Gone.

347
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:30,125
What is that alarm for?

348
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,041
It seems they've been doing work
with alien spores out here.

349
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,458
And now they've broken
free from containment.

350
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,041
[TATIANA] So what
is the outcome...?

351
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,375
Do the spores have
harmful effects on humans?

352
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,625
[GUERIN] I understand they've
already lost one man in the lab.

Target is the Euro-American
joint colony...

Colony is compromised...

359
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,041
There are fatal
spores throughout.

360
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,791
What are you doing?!

361
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,416
[GUERIN] Don't you understand?

362
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,833
This is our only chance.

363
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,416
We can be rid of them
and do what we need to do.

364
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,625
No, I won't allow it.

365
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,791
I am ordering you to
rescind the strike.

366
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,875
Damn you.

367
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:41,333
We've wasted enough
time with your diplomacy.

368
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,041
You should go run and
find your daughter.

I want a controlled burn

00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,750
[BELTIN] Did you
hear me, Michael?

380
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,750
[MICHAEL] But, sir...

381
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,250
[BELTIN] That's an order.

382
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:47,166
Spores could get out.
Burn the whole section away.

[MICHAEL] What we've discovered

445
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,000
is that this fungus feeds on
excretory waste from the skin,

446
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,958
while facilitating the
exchange of CO2 and oxygen

directly through
the bloodstream.

[MICHAEL] Heh. The increased
O2 in our systems

00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:03,041
could definitely account
for how good we all feel.

What's more...

453

the inhalation of the spores

with you, Colonel.

All those lovely

the moment they leave the
atmosphere of their home world.

to those things.

would you say we left
our mark on that planet?

00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,208
Or was it reversed...

479
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:50,041
did that planet leave
its mark on us?
