My son hasn't come home yet!

towards Castle Draluc.

[RONALDO]
Draluc.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
[MAN 01A]
He's a fearsome progenitor

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
and an invincible vampire!

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
[MOTHER 01A]
I beg of you, sir!

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
Please save my son, Vampire

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Leave it to me.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
Invincible progenitor?

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
If I can hunt that down,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
it'll be a nice addition
to my title collection.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Now, reveal yourself, Draluc!

The progenitor and
invincible vampire, Draluc.

You're kidding, right?

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
What's up with this door?

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center

All I did was open the door.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.707 position:50% align:center
I commend your courage
in coming to this castle alone.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
Answer this, foolish trespasser:

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
did you commit
this act of violence

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
knowing I am the progenitor
and invincible vampire, Draluc?

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
Damn straight! I, Vampire
Hunter Ronaldo the Great,

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
have come to eliminate you!

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Is that right?

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Again?!

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.056 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Don't mind me; I'm a hornworm.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
Just ignore me.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] My intro
sequence was wasted on you!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're <i>the</i> Draluc?

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
You're not just some tourist
in a crappy cosplay?

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
If that were the case,

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
then you would have murdered
a cosplaying tourist.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
Are you cool with that?

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am indeed
the vampire, Draluc.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
However, I am not
the powerful being

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
you silly humans
make me out to be.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
So you're not really an
invincible progenitor?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Not really.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
That's just something
a tour bus guide made up,

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
and it ended up spreading.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
You could have told
people it wasn't true!

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
I could have,

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
but the locals believed it and
used it to revitalize the town.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
Who am I to take
that away from them?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Okay, so, the real story is
you're a little weak potato.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.060 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You dare mock me?!

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
I'm a formidable adversary
in fighting games.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
You wanna fight me?

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
No, I don't!

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Ah, you're not a fan
of fighting games?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
That's fine. We can play
Vamperman instead--sand.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
You're hopeless!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
On top of being super weak,
you're also a super freak!

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.369 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] What's with
the unwarranted hostility?!

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Do you like little boys?

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Where is the one
that you kidnapped?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
That's actual slander!

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
I like grown women with
graceful, swan-like necks!

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:14.504 position:50% align:center
Spare me your kinky fetishes,
you sick piece of trash!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
Those video games are
bait to kidnap children,

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
aren't they, you pervert?

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Not at all!
They are purely my hobby!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
"Hey, kid, wanna come over
and play with my joystick"?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
Wow, cool hobby!

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
See? You're the pervert!

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
What are you doing, little boy?

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
QSQ.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
He meant why are you here?

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
He's got, like,
a ton of games here,

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
so I've been comin'
every day to play them.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Every day?!

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Ah, makes sense--

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
vampires sleep during the day.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I thought there were
a bunch of extra save files.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
And you never questioned it?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A] Today, I was
trying to beat the game,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
and I lost track of time.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
You think you can
simply get away

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
with trespassing into my castle?

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
I am the vampire, Draluc, boy!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A] Yeah? You're way
uglier than I thought.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. What a class-A letdown.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
Let's go, kid.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A] No way, man. If I go
home now, my mom'll be pissed.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
Nah, she won't be pissed.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
Your mom, she was
really worried about you.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
To a mother, her child is
always the most important thing.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you know jack
squat about my mom, dude.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Shut up!
I was just trying to make a
point!

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A]
Anyway, I'm not going home yet!

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
Later, dude bros!

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.114 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Stop!
You're scratching the floor!

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
Hah! You fool.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
Don't think you
can beat me to him.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
Not inside my own castle!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hang on! Remember, he's a kid!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
Now, small boy. Come quietly--

Hey, lead the way,
you stupid vampire!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
Give me a sec. My leg's still
smarting from that kick--

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
kid's stronger than he looks.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
Now look here, if anything
happens to that kid,

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
you're gonna pay.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
The big, bad hunter's
nice to bratty kids, huh?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
Of course I am!

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
You can't become an expert
hunter just by being strong.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
If people don't
know and like you,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
then you won't get any jobs.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
I always act like a perfect
gentleman with my clients,

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
and I even help
keep the community

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:12.747 position:50% align:center

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
That's how I've achieved
this high level of success.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
But if something were to happen
to a client's kid on my watch?

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
I would be out of a damn job
by tomorrow morning!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center

turn into a bat and go first!

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center

Just give me a little chop!

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
If I die,
I'll go back to normal!

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
Hang on a sec.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
Why don't we lure
him with something?

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hmm?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.505 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Maybe my popular autobiography?

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.340 position:50% align:center
You carry those around with you?

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] It's been
published by a real publisher!

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50% align:center
You can have a copy of
your own if you want! Here!

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
No! Never!

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
Not even if it
was stuffed with money!

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
You think that rude,
little boy will read this?!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:58.019 position:50% align:center
Yes, children can appreciate
literature better than anyone!

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
Which, speak of the
devil, there he is!

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
Damn it; he never stops.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
Look, Hunter, we're
going nowhere like this.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
Let's attack from both sides.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
I'll try to cut him off
from the hallway

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
and you keep chasing
after him from here.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
If you die again,
I'm gonna kill you!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Fool!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
That room is lousy with
traps set for trespassers.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
You and the boy can both
become my victims, Hunter!

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC cackles]

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm?

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hey, man!

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
There was a scary,
beam-shooting thing in there!

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
So why in the world
would you bring it out here?!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
Sand...

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
What the hell is this?!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It emits low electric
pulses to relax muscles.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
Oh, and those low electric
pulses were enough to kill you?

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
This thing aimed
and fired at me!

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Yes, that's the
special function where it locks

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
onto trespassers and
tries to work out the knots

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
in their shoulders! Nice, huh?

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] That's enough! I'm
not letting you out of my sight!

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Please, no! My muscles are fine!

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Look! This place
is clearly booby trapped!

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Quit lying to me!

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
So, then, you saw the traps,

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
and you went in anyway?

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Well? What're those big spikes?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
Oh, those? They're my
special health implements!

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
"Poison Gas"?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
That's a little on
the nose, don't ya think?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
That's just my name for
our signature floral scent

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
that gets released when
you step on that button!

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.551 position:50% align:center
Right, then you can demonstrate

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
that pointy acupressure
foot massage for me!

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Uh, I don't need it!
I'm in such great health that

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
the stimulation of the
acupressure could kill me!

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hmm?

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
It's your signature
floral scent!

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.108 position:50% align:center
Nothing to worry about, right?!

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
I'm just not particularly
fond of the aroma!

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO panting]
Jeez, that was terrible.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
What the--? How did you
get past those traps, kid?

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
It would be way
harder to actually

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
get caught in
such obvious traps.

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] You're really
unpleasant, you know that?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
I'm taking you home
now, you little pest.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A]
Ugh, for real?

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
You must also return
my QSQ at once boy!

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A] Just wait
until I clear this level.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
Take it with you. Let's go!

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
Don't take it with you!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
I'll go; gimme
five more minutes!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
[BOY 01A grunts]

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC gasps]

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
Uh... I'm sorry.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
That was, y'know...

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yells] The things that
shoot beams from their eyes!

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
This is what happens

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
when you make a
fool of me, humans.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
I shall make you regret ever
setting foot in my castle!

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, do not worry.
You'll die a dramatic death,

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
sacrificing yourself
for a child.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
Now... that is enough talk.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
Farewell then, Hunter.

Sand!

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
That hurts! What happened?

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
It was set to get him!

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
Wow, concentrated fire.

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] You altered the
trap's control unit somehow,

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
didn't you, you brat?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, I pushed some buttons.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
But why?!

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center

Oh, come on!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center

Damn it, this isn't over!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center

Crap! Let's get outta here!

[DRALUC]
Dnas.

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center

of ups and downs, right?

[DRALUC cackles]

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.377 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
On the bright side,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
at least I have two human
sacrifices to offer my castle.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
Now then, it's time
to donate your blood.

Wha--?

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, the sun!

[KAMEYA gasps] Hey, Ronaldo!
I heard about your latest feat!

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
really hunted down

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
the progenitor and
invincible vampire, Draluc!

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center
[ROKUON] Care to share
details? Spill the scoop?

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
The vampire's a weakling

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center
and the kid's a jerk. The end!

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Sorry, boys.
Gotta get to another job.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
Maybe next time.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.227 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA grunts]
But--!

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Welcome home!

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
Begone, now!

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.322 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Come on!
Won't you at least hear me out?

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] How did you
find out where I live?

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Your website
has detailed directions.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.953 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Damn it! I've gotta fix that!

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
Why are you still alive
and kicking, though?

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
The morning sun
disintegrated you!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:14.169 position:50% align:center
I would've been a goner if
I'd been left in the sunlight.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
But, the boy was kind
enough to protect me from that

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
and hid me from the sun.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.384 position:50% align:center
However, the boy's mother

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
said he couldn't have a pet
vampire, so I was driven away.

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
So, I thought you and I could be
roomies for a bit, whaddaya say?

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hell no!

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
And why would you bring
all that stuff with you?

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
They're my daily necessities!

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Since when do game consoles

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
count as daily necessities?

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
And a coffin?

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
I can't sleep well without it.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] And the
thing that shoots beams!

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It's the "thing that
shoots beams from its eye."

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
But why did you bring it here?!

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
As a memento and it'd
make a nice hat stand.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
That's dumb!

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I also brought
John the Armadillo.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
John?!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I guess you could call
him my familiar.

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
He wasn't even in the castle!

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Ah, but he was.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
In that room with all the traps.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
I'd call that animal abuse!

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Nah, John's got a hard
shell, so it's fine.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
John, if you don't like
something, you can just say so!

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of John,
but you have to get out!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
How dare you try to
triangulate me and John?

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
In case you forgot,

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
you're the reason our
home has been destroyed!

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.945 position:50% align:center
I'm going to sue you for
damages! QSQ! Castle!

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
QSQ! John!

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
Oh, this is all
one big, long con!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
It's a hunter's job to help
citizens in need, isn't it?

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
A hunter's job is to exterminate
pests like you, actually!

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
Well, you know, there are
all sorts of vampires.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
The ones that bear
ill will toward humans

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
and wish to harm them or the
inferior types you lot fight.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:46.011 position:50% align:center
Superior vampires,
vampire lords like me?

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
We're friendly, intelligent,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
and known to coexist
quite well with human society.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
So, starting today,
we're roomies!

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC screams]

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
You seem more like the
stupid, inferior, harmful type!

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
You're nothing but a target
that should be eliminated!

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] No! Wait!

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Can you stop it with the death
and the murder please?

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC screams]

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
Great! It's a party!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, please help me!
I'm desperate!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] You're the
manager from Vanima, right?

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
I'm so embarrassed,
but it's my idiot son.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Excuse me.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
There's something
behind this door!

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Sand.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
I thought I caught a glimpse
of a person back there.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
Oh, just a part-time worker.
Don't worry about it.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 01A] You just crushed
your part-time worker?!

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Bastard! You slammed
the door on me not just once,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
but twice!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Ah! A vampire!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, I can explain!
It's a funny story.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
After I defeated him,
he rehabilitated

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
and wanted to work
for me, so I said yes.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
Why would I ever want
to be your part-timer?!

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Shut up!

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 01A]
It doesn't matter.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
Both of you,
please come with me!

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
I told you, I need
help! Desperately!

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO]
Get away from me!

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
I'm going to turn into a vampire
and I don't want to get better!

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
Just calm down, Bubuo!

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO]
Don't come near me!

00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
I'll bite her! I will do it!

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:03.880 position:50% align:center
I came all the way out
here for a pseudo-vampire?

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
It appears as though he was just
bitten by an inferior vampire.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just take him
to the hospital for a shot

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
and he'll be okay.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
Even if you do nothing,

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
you won't turn into
a real vampire, you know.

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 01A]
That's what I told him, too.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
Buncha dumb adults! Why should
I believe your stupid lies?!

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.856 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure
what the air guitar

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
and scream-singing is all about.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
You're right--he is an idiot.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
If he hurts Eri,
my part-timer, it'll be bad!

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
Please, you gotta talk him down!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
Heh. I guess I have no choice.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
Why do you want to
be a vampire, anyway?

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
Come on! Isn't it obvious?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
It's because, uh-- I wanna
become a vampire because

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
they live forever, and um...

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
Freedom!

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
To, like, retreat from society.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
I want freedom, to live forever,

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
and not work at
a convenience store!

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Your motivation is lame at best!

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
I mean, to be fair,

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
I had some dumb dreams
when I was young, too.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.103 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a pole dancer,

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
and I had no good
reason, either.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
Save it for your memoirs!
You're not helping here!

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
You! If you wanna
become a vampire,

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
you'd better know your reasons!

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
You wanna be that guy?

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC groans] My cape got
caught in the automatic door.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You toddler!

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
Wh-What's up with that dude?

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
What, he's not everything
you aspire to be?

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
Hey there!
I'm the vampire, Draluc.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO stammers]

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hey.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO gasps]
What the hell?! Stop lying!

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
Stop lie-aye-aye-
aye-aye-aye-in'!

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Right now
you look like you just saw

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
the girl you like making
out with a dirty old man.

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
You cretin! A real vampire
deigned to show himself,

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
and you behave so rudely?

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
Maybe because the "real vampire"
was trapped like a beetle.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
But the plan to disillusion
him and force him

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
to face reality
seems to be working.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
Now, Lord Dral.
Die a lame death.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
Why are you talking like
a heel in pro wrestlin--

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
Sand...

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
I-I'm nothin' like that guy!

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
I'll become a way stronger
vampire than he could ever be!

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Oh, is that so?

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
But then you will have
nowhere to run from your fate!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
Because I, Vampire
Hunter Ronaldo the Great,

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
will destroy you!

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO gasps]
You're Ronaldo?

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
I just read your autobiography.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
It was really good.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can sign that
for you if you want.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo!

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
You read <i>The War</i>
<i>Chronicles of Ronaldo</i>

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
and still want to make
an enemy of hunters?

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
That's one of my main reasons!

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
Being able to fight hunters like
you makes me wanna be a vampire!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
Hey, dude.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just let your
son live out his dreams--

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo!

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I will become
a real vampire!

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
You and my old man should
just get out of my way!

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Yes, I agree your noble ambition

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
should be respected, indeed.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO gasps]

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Draluc, when did you--

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, a pseudo-vampire

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
cannot become
a full vampire, it's true.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
On the other hand, I can
give you what you desire.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
But only if you offer
me your blood, that is.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:57.053 position:50% align:center
But I don't wanna become a lame,

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
weak-sauce vampire
like you, brah.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] The level of strength
that you shall achieve,

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
the kind of ability
you shall possess--

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
it all depends on who you are.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
Are you losing
your nerve so soon?

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO] Don't make
fun of me, you bastard.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
Fine, if it'll make me a
vampire, then take my blood!

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Stop! Draluc, don't do it!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
[hisses]

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO gasps]

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Sand...

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
Young men's blood is so rich!

00:19:31.796 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
All I've been eating
is milk lately,

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
so his rich blood was too
much for my stomach to handle.

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
Someone take his vampire card.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO]
Damn it.

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
So this means I can't
become a vampire after all?

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what we've
been trying to tell you.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
[BUBUO] I thought
if I became a vampire,

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
then I could
convince Eri to date me.

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
By Eri...?

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
Do you mean me?

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Remember what you said

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
when I first confessed
my feelings to you?

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
Life is short, you know?

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
And you shouldn't waste yours
dating someone like me.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want you to
look back and have regrets.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
Vampires live forever,
so I figured that might work!

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't have to worry about
me wasting my life with you!

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.633 position:50% align:center
Look, Bubuo...

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
I was just trying to
let you down gently.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
I couldn't be honest with you

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
because you're
the manager's son.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
The truth is, you're not my
type. Like, at all.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
And, anyway, going crazy
and holding me hostage

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
is the very worst thing
you could have done.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm quitting soon...

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
...to marry a rich guy
20 years older than me.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Well, my shift's over.

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
I'm going home, Manager.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Uh! Uh, right.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
I wish I were a bird.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hang in there, bro!

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
Anyway, guess
this case is closed--

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA]
I saw the whole thing, Ronaldo!

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts]

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
You took care of
the next job fast, too!

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
And you were working
alongside a vampire?

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
[ROKUON] This is the
scoop of the century!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
Can we write this up in
<i>Vampire Hunter Weekly</i> ?

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
Wait, this isn't what you think!

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA] Oh, can we get
a comment, Mr. Manager?

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
I knew their plan
from the beginning,

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.486 position:50% align:center
and I knew I had to
help them save my son.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.780 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Don't get
intoxicated by the press!

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
One could say that this case

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
only got resolved
because I was here.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Only a
moron would say that!

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.539 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, you care to comment?

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA]
A Vampire Hunter-Vampire team?

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
How did it start?

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
No, that's not--

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA]
Tell us your plans for the new

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo Vampire Hunter Agency

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
now that you've
decided to team up!

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO chuckles]
Well, I guess...

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
We'll-We'll hunt
down any job you've got

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
and solve all your
vampire problems.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
Draluc! I knew that
you would betray me!

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:08.578 position:50% align:center
Well, betraying hunters
is what we vampires do.
