[RONALDO] Crap. I didn't
think Handa's mom would win.

it's gonna be a total disaster!

And if this fails, Mr. Fukuma
will chop me to pieces!

to get through this

and keep the peace!

Things sure are getting
interesting aren't they, John?

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
I was wondering why you
called me so suddenly,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
but it's obvious now.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you're
just sneaking around though.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center

you would go charging in

looking fo-fo-fo--

forward to this!

And yet! If I can expose
him while he's with her,

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
she'll be disillusioned
and come to her senses!

That's fine.

planning to expose him?

[HANDA chuckles] These kinds
of dates are all the same--

they usually involve
a meal and a walk.

My guess is, they'll prob'ly go
to the restaurant up ahead.

one bite and go, "Gah!"

I can't believe
you're Handa's mom.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
I mean, it is written on
page 52 of volume one

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
that you don't like celery,

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center

up on the agenda?

heart, pure as driven snow.

So, what now?

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
Okay, so first, you have
to transform into a cute bat.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
I do not think you've
done nearly enough research

about vampires.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center

you depict Draluc!

My son was so adorable
when he was young.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
Because he was weak,
I worried a lot.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
But 200 years ago, we vampires
were much more at odds

with humans than we are today.

protect that frail child

to say it like that,

This is awful!

Are you telling me that you
cause Draluc to die regularly?

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.871 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Shut up!
He dies on his own all the time!

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center

than a carnival goldfish!

right in this place?

John! No!

John's eyes look so sad.
What did you do?!

00:19:00.432 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
That was nothing! It was--

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, John!

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
I won't allow this!

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
I cannot let Draluc
stay with the likes of you!

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
I'm taking him home!

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
Fine, then take him home!

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
It'll be a relief to get
rid of that pain in the ass.

Ah...

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
Your teamwork with that vampire
was surprisingly well-received.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
The editor-in-chief would
like to see more of that.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to it.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Hold on, don't be rash;

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
let's ask Draluc
what he wants to do.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS grunts]
Oh, right.

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
But where is he?

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
He hasn't been answering
any of my texts or calls.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.506 position:50% align:center
Could it be that
he's been kidnapped?

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Let him leave the nest already!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
Be quiet! Anything could happen
to a child as cute as he is--

[ODD CREATURE]
Excuse me.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO, DRAUS]
Hm?

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, we're not open today.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Hey there,
friend! Wanna trade adult DVDs?

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
Check it out, Draluc's back.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Father.
I love this town, let me stay.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
You think me stupid?

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
Stop messing around!
I'm going to look for Draluc!

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Hey, wait up!
Fine, I'll go, too!

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
Not here.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
Bummer.

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll have to search
the places that dummy might go.

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
Draluc? Oh, I haven't
seen him today.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Tell him I want him to make me
pudding next time I do, though!

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Where's Draluc?
I haven't seen him.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.258 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's at the guild.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're his dad?

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello there.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] No, he hasn't
been here at all today.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
Oh, his hot milk tab
is growing, so send him by.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
And will you please tell him

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
to stop calling me
"Mr. Bearded Lady Lover"?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.979 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Draluc, huh?

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I haven't
seen him this evening.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
Did you get into
a fight? [giggles]

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] Hey, you idiot! I heard
you were looking for Draluc!

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Hey, come here!

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
Don't ignore me! Hey!

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Damn it.
Where did that moron go?

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS] Draluc, I came
to play with you! Draluc!

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
Are you bored in this
castle all by yourself?

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, Father.

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
I have John and
my pile of games to play.

00:20:58.383 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to worry about me.

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
With just me and John here, it's
relaxing, and then I don't die.

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
I've decided not to
bring him home.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO, JOHN grunt]

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS]
I'm happy.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
My child is having
fun in this town.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
It appears my son
has met a good human.

--[RONALDO grunts]
--[SHINICHI] Oh, there he is!

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
[SHINICHI] We went to your
office, but you weren't there!

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
We've been looking
for you, Ronaldo!

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry about that.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
Where is Dra--?

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
He's transformed into
super shiny mud balls!

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] What fun! I'm shining
like a string of pearls!

Oh, shut up, damn it!

[JOHN grunting]

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
That reminds me;

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
how's the new manuscript
coming along?

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
I lost my motivation
thanks to you guys.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
Hey, John, lemme
try the turntable.

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] We'll settle
this before dawn breaks!

[DRALUC] John! Do not worry!
We will save you!
