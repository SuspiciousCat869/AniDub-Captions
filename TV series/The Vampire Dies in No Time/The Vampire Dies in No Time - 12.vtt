00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:10.927 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA] So, this is the
last place where Tsujigiri

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.263 position:50% align:center
was heard from: Shin-Yokohama.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.473 position:50% align:center
I wondered what
kind of place it was.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
Just seems like a small town.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
How disappointing.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA chuckles]
But no matter.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
It'll do just fine
for a quick meal or two.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.370 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:04.040 position:50% align:center
Are there any pretty
young ladies in this town?

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You look quite dangerous.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
I've not seen you
before, compatriot.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
Good grief, and I was
just out for a walk.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center
I don't care what other
people eat--no judgment.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
But Shin-Yoko is my territory.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center
You will leave
this place at once!

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.602 position:50% align:center
Good evening,
my foolish compatriot.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
And what if I refuse?

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50% align:center
I would be delighted to
hear how you plan to make me.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC grumbles]

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
You have no plan?

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.739 position:50% align:center
[shrieking]
What's with this bottle?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.240 position:50% align:center
Hey! Lemme out!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
He was so much weaker than
I expected that I just panicked.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
No use.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center
No matter how
much noise you make,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
no one but me can hear you.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't want you
regenerating, now would we?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
So perhaps I'll just
throw you into the river.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC yelps]
This town's got ostriches, and

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
Vamp Control, and hunters!

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
They're all very strong! They'll
eliminate you in no time!

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
Oh? That sounds like fun.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
Change of plans then.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
My first meal in this town
will be a hunter; I can't wait!

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC grumbles]
It pains me to say this,

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
but I'm counting
on you, Ronaldo!

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.981 position:50% align:center
You'd better save me fast!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Huh? What are you doing?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Walking alone at this hour?

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.571 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ronaldo!

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Miss, it's
dangerous for a lady to--

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
Whoa, big boobies.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
Boobing your boobs alone
is booby booberous.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
You idiot! What foolishness!

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Feckless hunter!
She's a vampire!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and eliminate her!

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
You dunce, I told you;

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who
can hear your voice.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
Perfect.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
I'll take advantage
and drink his blood.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Boobs?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I've only just
arrived here in Shin-Yoko.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
Will you show me around,
Mr. Hunter?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
Hey, Assy.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
Shin-Yoko, good
places, nice mood.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
Uh, hot date spots.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
Pathetic!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
There are zero good date
spots in Shin-Yoko!

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
Anyway, aren't you supposed
to be working here?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO clears throat]

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
Well, then...
Uh, yeah, sure, Miss.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to, um...
I could, uh--

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.583 position:50% align:center
I know a place with a really
romantic view of the whole town.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
I'll show you if you want.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
And like some
other romantic stuff.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
Hopeless!

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
In that case, is there somewhere

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
you and I could go
to have a few drinks, maybe?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
I'll drink you under the table.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
But the night view is lovely.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Stop talking about
the night view!

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
You have absolutely no game!

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
Oh, I mean, drinks!
Sure, yeah! Hold on.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
Uh! Hey, Assy.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! It isn't that
I don't like night views.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.568 position:50% align:center
It's just that
I'm a little hungry.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Oh, right, of course!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
You can have this ham cutlet
I got at the convenience store!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
What is wrong with you?

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
Or the minced meat cutlet?

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
Whichever one you'd prefer,
just say the word.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
Do you actually think
she's going to eat one of them?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'll take the ham.

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Wrong move!

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
If you don't reject him sternly,
he's never going to stop!

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Would you like
me to sauce that?

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
Don't act like you're
all suave now, mister!

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50% align:center
Oh! [giggles] It's nothing!

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
Tasty ham!

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:08.224 position:50% align:center
Now, take me to this
night view you mentioned.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
Oh, yeah. I think vodka

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
should be chilled and
taken straight, in one gulp.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
I'll get him alone

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
and then surprise him
with an attack!

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
Awkward!

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
So, you said you're
a hunter, right?

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
What kind of work
does a hunter do?

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. We do cool stuff

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
like beat up naked dudes
with flowers on their junk.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
Also, we fight old guys
who make us talk dirty,

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50% align:center
but all I could say was boobs;
it was so stupid.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] He's given you the
perfect opening to kick his ass!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
Shut up! Nobody
said you could talk!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO] Huh?
--[ARANEA] Oh, it's nothing.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA giggles]

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO chuckles]
Welp, we're here.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited, I can't wait!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC stammers]
Ronaldo!

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA gasps, groans]

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
Vampire Tranquilizer Bullets!

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
You--!

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
Sorry about the bad date,
especially the bad acting.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
I had no other choice.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
But I had to bring you
out here somehow,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
without letting you get
too close to anyone else.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA gasps]

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Oh, how ridiculous.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
As if I would allow
myself to be tricked!

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
All right, then.

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll just
have to cut to the chase.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
This is the part where
I make a meal out of

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
every one of you, right here!

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
And now, I'll suck out every
drop of your blood, you worms!

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center

[SATETSU growls]

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA gasps]
Pathetic!

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA]
They must be dreaming!

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA yelps]

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Like I could ever lose to you!

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
[ARANEA whimpers]

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
[SHOT] We could've
beat her without you

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
putting on that little show.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
You say that now,
but it would've been bad

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
to fight her somewhere
with civilians present.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:20.565 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Okay...

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
But that performance was
so much like your true self

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't even
tell you were acting.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO] Was not!
--[DRALUC] Sand.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how did you figure
out what she really was?

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I knew from the start.

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
There was an alert
issued in another town.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
And besides, she
called me "Mr. Hunter"

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
before I had a chance
to tell her my name.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
Wait. Just from that?

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
Even though you're super dense

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
and have been leveling up
your stupidity?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
Sand!

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
More than anything,

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
I had a strong instinct
something was off.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Because a hot
lady was flirting with me.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Oh! Ronaldo!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center

Uh, Ronaldo.

[RONALDO grunts]

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
Happy Halloween.

[RONALDO screams]

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
What is your problem?
I'm gonna have nightmares!

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
[TELESCOPE GOLDFISH chuckles]
But you would.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
My impression of
Ronaldo when he thinks

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
someone just asking for
directions is a fan.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
[JOHN chatters]

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.782 position:50% align:center
Why, yes, I'm Ronaldo.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
I'm so flattered.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.452 position:50% align:center
I can sign an
autograph if you--uh!

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yes. It's just up
there ahead on the right,

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you!

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[TELESCOPE GOLDFISH]
Seems like something he'd do.

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Well, here's my impression
of the cursed sand

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
when he realizes he's a loser.

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Just as expected
of Ronaldo the Great.

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
I could never beat you.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
Oh, someone doesn't
understand this one, stupid!

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.596 position:50% align:center
I'd never say that,
so you lose one million points.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
My impression of Goldie.

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:25.350 position:50% align:center
Glub, glub. It's about
time for you to feed me--

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Draluc wins this one.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
My impression of
a printing press!

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC screams]
Draw the next one, moron!

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.819 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Seriously? Haiku?

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.488 position:50% align:center
Shut up. It's hard to
think of 30 things, you jerk.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:40.198 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hmph.

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
Tweety tweety bird.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
Look at the pretty mountain.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
The river is nice.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ronaldo's haiku sounds like one

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
a five-year-old wrote that
got put on a bottle of tea.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
[TELESCOPE GOLDFISH] Matsuo
Basho's rolling in his grave.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
Shut up, scum!

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
O, the rising moon.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
The moon is beautiful,
on a moonlit night.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Yours isn't much better.

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
[TELESCOPE GOLDFISH]
It's a bit trite and redundant.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
You're right, not much better.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.848 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO] Mr. Goldie!
--[DRALUC] Who won this?

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
I'm sleepy and I need to fart.

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
All right, you damn bastard!

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
This is the last match!

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
And the loser buys
the damn VS5 Pro!

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.697 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO] Huh?
--[DRALUC] Hm?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.096 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Wanna just split it?

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Yeah.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
All right! The VS5 Pro Ultra
Powerful Grade Justice X2!

We got it!

Now I can finally
play Bio Break 10-2!

[RONALDO] Now I can Netflips and
chill with Alien Pole Dancer!

--[DRALUC] Hm?
--[RONALDO] Uh?

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Ah!

[RONALDO growls]

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
 Damn, dirty, frickin' sand!

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:14.209 position:50% align:center
You big, stupid kid!
