I'm not late. What the hell?

You literally just called me!

I won't argue with fools.

Take a look at these materials.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
This is an organism we
engineered in the lab--

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.291 position:50% align:center
Ahem! I mean,
captured for research.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
It doesn't suck much blood,

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
so there is little danger
in the organism itself.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
However, because it is parasitic

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
and has abilities similar to
hypnosis or brainwashing,

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:56.096 position:50% align:center
it could exert unintended
influence on human society.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center

You idiot!

No facility is
completely secure,

somewhat unavoidable--

no responsibility.

[RONALDO] He's the director of

a household name

in the field of

He's also the one who created

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
the medicine to
treat pseudovampires.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
But he's got an overblown ego

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
and makes me clean up
his messes all the time!

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
So he creates as many
problems as he solves?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center

so I won't get in trouble

am I supposed to know?

[YOMOTSUZAKA coughs]

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
It might help to know
that the vampiric bug

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.250 position:50% align:center
gives off powerful

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center

infatuated with the host.

For real? I want that!

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center

attaches at the lower abdomen
