[screams]

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHIA] Tsujigiri Nagiri
has appeared in this town.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.486 position:50% align:center
A vampire with a danger
Level higher than A.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
He's been put on
the most wanted list.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
We request the cooperation
of the Hunters Guild.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
Be forewarned: Tsujigiri is
an extremely dangerous vampire.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
He hardens his own
blood into a blade,

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
which he uses to
slash open his victims

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
and draws out their blood.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
It's a fearsome ability,
but his immortality is scarier.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
Using supernatural means,
he's taken his soul--

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
if you can even call it that--

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
and separated it from
his body, then hidden it.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
As long as that isn't destroyed,
Tsujigiri won't budge,

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
even if he's staked
or exposed to sunlight.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
He's immortal.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.064 position:50% align:center
Therefore, our main
objectives are to arrest him,

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
then locate and
destroy his "soul."

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
I humbly ask you to
help me defeat Tsujigiri

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
and protect this town!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.165 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Jeez, I wonder
what Ronaldo and the others

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
are rushing around
for this time.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaking]

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
Eh, whatever.

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.338 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you seem to really like
digging holes, don't you, John?

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.465 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm? What's wrong, John?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
What's that you found?

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
Ah, a small coffin?
What's inside it?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
A doll, huh?

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
I could swear
I've run into something

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
very similar to this before.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
I can't remember what it was.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
Could I not touch it?

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
On the other hand, it looks fun,
so I'll take it home!

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm the type
who can't resist

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
pushing a button
I'm not supposed to!

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.993 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grumbles]

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
Hmm...

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
What? No! It's gone!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
My spirit effigy!

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
How could someone carry it off
in such a short amount of time?

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
Was it a hunter with
investigative abilities?

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI grunts]

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50% align:center
[SHINICHI]
Where is that bad vampire?

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
We'll get rid of it
once and for all!

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.066 position:50% align:center
It's dark and creepy
around here. [yelps]

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
[SHINICHI]
Hmm? What're you doing, old man?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
There's a vampire
alert out right now!

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous!

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
You little brats-- Agh!

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Old man!

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC grunts]
Oops.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Look at that hand!
This is that bad vampire!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
For real? Let's be
the ones to beat him!

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
He looks weakened.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
But wouldn't that
be kinda dangerous?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
We could always just
harass him a little bit?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chuckles]

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] All right, let's
cover him with glue and stuff!

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
Ah! Stop it, you brats!

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
Get outta here!

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
Bastards, I'll slash you into
tiny pieces!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN laugh]

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
Whoa. They're fast.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI] Now... My spirit
effigy is being hurt!

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
I need to get it back
as soon as possible!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
I'm back!

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ronaldo, I found
this weird thing by the--

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's not here.
Did he get a job or something?

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
No matter.
I'll wait for him, then.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50% align:center
Would you care for
something to drink, sir?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] A hot milk, please.
Put it on Ronaldo's tab.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI] Good. I can feel
my spirit effigy close by.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
Hm?! The Vampire
Control Division!

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Damn! She's in the way.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
Should I cut her down
and pass through?

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
[KOYUKI gasps]

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center

So hot!

[HINAICHI]
Who's there?!

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
[KOYUKI]
Did I burn you? I'm sorry.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] No, don't worry;
you just got the doll.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
Wipey, wipey.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI screeches]
Owie!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
Ouch! My eyes!

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Oh, oh, oh! Don't do that!

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI yelps] This guy looks
like he's totally hammered!

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI groans]
What?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
Who are you calling a drunk?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
Pardon. Let me get
this outta the way.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Listen good, lady. My
name is Tsuji--

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI screams]

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI screams]

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI] What? Is something
the matter, Tsuji-argh?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
Just hang in there, Tsuji-argh!

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
No, that's not--

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
That's not my name.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.808 position:50% align:center
Anyway, please
just leave me alone.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI] Are you feeling sick?
Do you need an ambulance?

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI groans]
No.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
I don't need one...
because right now

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
you're the one who needs...
who needs, uh--

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
The one... Forget it.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
You can tell me after
you've calmed down a bit.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
No need to pay me.
I found this thing.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
Yes, but it's soaking wet.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI growls] Right here,
right now, you and me--

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] We could
take off the wet clothes.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI screams] A-A flasher?
An elaborate exhibitionist?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh, no!
I'm not really!

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
What's that little guy
you've got there, Dral?

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC gasps] Nothing. I mean,
just a little doll I found,

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
but the clothes got all wet.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
Oh, the poor dear!

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
You bastard. Why the clothes?

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
I can't move around
as I please like this.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
Think! I need some
kind of clothes!

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Clothes. Clothes!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[NAGIRI]
Hm? Huh?!

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
Stop right there!
You're under arrest

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.206 position:50% align:center
for public indecency, buddy!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
No, way!

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
I at least want to be caught

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
wearing something less
embarrassing!

run off to, ya damn vampire?!

Sand!

[NAGIRI] Huh? Over there!
My spirit effigy is right there!

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
How dare you toy
with me like this!

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Bastard,
what are you playing at?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center

[SENYA]
How was the patrol?

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Uh, we couldn't find
Tsujigiri, but...

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] Well, I'm just
glad you're alright.

Okay! Too close! Too close!

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
That Tsujigiri Nagiri
bastard appeared in Shin-Yoko!

--[DRALUC] No way!

was around here?

Scary! Sand.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
Who is this guy anyway?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:49.177 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Bosatsu! Come out, Bosatsu!

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
How's it going, Ronaldo?

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Well, not good.

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
He's gotten himself behind
the plumbing somehow.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Huh. Inconvenient.

Before he poops we'd better--

--[RONALDO yelps]
--[DRALUC] Sand!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Has a vampire appeared?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
What is your freaking problem?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
I came to observe Draluc.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.113 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why did you come
up out of the floor, moron?

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
Last time, that idiot Handa

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
came in my place without
permission, so I thought I'd--

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Don't tell me you made a path

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
down there without asking?
What is wrong with you people?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd formally--

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Anyway,
what about your other work?

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
You have a lot of free time?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Mm!

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Sorry. I went too far.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
Long time no see,
beautiful young lady--

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
Shut up.
I'm disappointed in you.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Sand! Why? What did I do?

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what were
you guys doing up there?

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, there's
this neighborhood stray.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
Got himself stuck up there.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
He always looks
like he's smiling,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
so we call him "Bosatsu."

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
But he won't come out
even when we call.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.899 position:50% align:center
[BOSATSU grumbles]

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Maybe he just doesn't like you.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You didn't have to say it...

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
All right, I'll help
you guys get him out!

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Oh, yeah? You really
must have a lot of free time!

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Free time...

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
Come on. Stop goofing
around. Let's go!

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
What should we do?

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center
Toss a bunch of
lemon peels up there?

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Poke him with a stick?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
Though, that might
have the opposite effect.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
What if we have
John talk to him?

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] John, convince
the cat to go outside.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaking]

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Huh? What's wrong, buddy?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It looks like
his little back is caught.

--[JOHN squeals]

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Ah! Hurry up and pull him out!

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
Maybe Bosatsu freaked out 'cause
an armadillo just showed up.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be better to try
and lure him out with food?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
I have some leftover
cookies I baked yesterday.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
He's a cat, not a toddler.

[HINAICHI grunts]
Mm! Bastard.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
What... What's in these things?!

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.627 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Welcome home.
I made your favorite dish.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Thanks, hon. I'm starved.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI] You little, are you
trying to seduce me again?

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] No, I was trying
to lure Bosatsu out.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
It's prob'ly faster to scare him
and chase him out than lure him.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
What if we make a loud noise?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Or we could do this:

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] You just want
an excuse to kill me!

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
You don't have any
respect for my life!

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:11.027 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Okay, Hinaichi.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
You catch the cat
when he's running away.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.072 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Leave it to me!

Stop! I'm trying to help!

Huh? Get him, Hinaichi.

are you all right?

capture those two rapscallions.

Yes, Master Bosatsu.

She's being controlled!

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
That guy!
Even though he's a cat,

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
he has the ability
to hypnotize people!

better powers than you.

cat away from Hinaichi!

Please come quietly!

You may as well give up now
and become my servant.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
Bad kitty, Bosatsu.
Why are you even doing this?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.061 position:50% align:center
With my hypnosis,

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
I will transform all of
humanity into cat worshippers!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
Humans will be slaves to cats.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
I envision a world where
hu-meow-nity's sole purpose

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
is to feed its cat masters.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center

has bigger ambitions

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center

you pet my soft, fluffy butt.

[RONALDO] Wh-- I don't
wanna pet your butt!

Kinda looks like he does to me.

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Go on, Ronaldo!
Hurry up and become a cat lover!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
If you do, then, you know.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center

are cute, or--

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center

to use brute force!

my feeble compatriot.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.174 position:50% align:center

a cat call me compatriot?

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center

but it looks like

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
my hyp-meow-sis doesn't
work on you friend.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
So, instead, I'll capture you
and use you as kitty litter.

Fate worse than death!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50% align:center
One moment, Master Bosatsu.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.646 position:50% align:center
He may be more useful as a cook.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
His cookies were delicious!

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
It'd be a waste to
just use him as litter.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
You do make a good point.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
Then, for three days
a week, he'll be my chef,

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
and he can be kitty litter
the remaining four.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center

food cooked by your toilet?

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
That's enough impertinent talk.

I've got you, Draluc.

What did you do, Dral-- Agh!

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
What was this urgent business
you had with me, Draluc?

you're bound to catch a cold.

He's our lethal weapon!

Aww, cute kitty!

than I love deadlines!

[DRALUC yells]
This is it for humanity!

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center

the cornerstone

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
of my plan to rule
over humanity--

Don't do it! Don't do it!

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
I can't. I can't stand it.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
No cat should ever
have its heart broken

here on earth just for us.

be treasured for all eternity.

Jeez, I can't believe a hunter

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center

just let that happen!

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
You're right.
I'm ashamed of myself.

Oh, shut up!

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center

able to stop him, either!

Hmph!

Oh, uh, Mr. Fukuma!

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
Sorry for all the trouble
with the cat and whatnot.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
No need to apologize.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
So what's in that carrier?

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
Oh, it's little Bosatsu.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.944 position:50% align:center
I decided to keep him as a pet.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.988 position:50% align:center
Really? How's that
working out for you?

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
Are you hypnotized?

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
I'm not. He's a very good boy.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
[BOSATSU]
Yes, it is the best home.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Thank you for letting
me be your pet kitty.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I've completed the
event and gotten all the items.

[JOHN squeaks]

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Ronaldo's
taking a long time.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
He said he was just
going to Vamima.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
Is he reading Champion
in the store or somethi--

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:43.151 position:50% align:center
I have come for you,
Vampire Draluc!

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
[JOHN, DRALUC shriek]

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Handa! Are you
here to search the house again

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
under the pretext of
surveillance?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.200 position:50% align:center
No, fool! I'm off duty today.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.452 position:50% align:center
If that's true,
then why are you here?

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.245 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Isn't it obvious?

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
Last time,
the two of us presented

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.083 position:50% align:center
a united front together.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
Also, you're a vampire
and I am a dhampir.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
Do I have to spell it out?

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm not following you!

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.300 position:50% align:center
Give me one, teeny little hint.

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Here's your hint:
I wanna hang out!

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh, okay.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
I've made a strange new friend.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Ronaldo isn't
home yet, so it's just us.

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
And he can stay out!

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
I don't want him
ruining my day off!

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
So, in order to keep
him away from home,

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
I went ahead and set up
dozens of celery traps

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
all around this building.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You're not kidding.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
He's sent many texts
asking for help.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
I get the whole
thing with your mom,

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
but you don't
mess around, do you?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
My mom? Ah!
This isn't about her!

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo's always been my enemy.

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Oh, yeah, you two went
to high school together, right?

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:42.877 position:50% align:center
Interesting!

00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
I'd love to hear
about the good old days.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
Hah! You're a real busybody,
aren't you, man?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. I'll tell
you about his past.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Whoa, you brought
a projector and everything?!

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
Weirdo!

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
Shut up! You're the one
who wanted to hear about it!

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
Look, I have lots
of documentation!

00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
So, what, do you, like,

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
carry that thing
around with you?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
You wanna hear, or no?

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
More than anything in the world.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
All right, then shut it!

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
Now, let's begin! Please remain
quiet during the screening!

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Hold on, lemme
just put my phone on silent.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Let's see, first--

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
My eyes!

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
To hook the audience,

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
I made a slideshow of
Ronaldo's shameful antics.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Skip it, please.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
Let's hear how your rivalry
got started to begin with.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Tch. Fine then, if you insist!

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
It was the first
day of school...

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Handa! You wanna
join Vamp Control, right?

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Well, I wanna become a hunter.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:32.886 position:50% align:center
Let's team up.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] You think you
can compete with me?!

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
Learn your place!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
I'm coming after you
before the vampires!

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
And so I understood

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
that he was a man
to be defeated.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Ronaldo walked right
into a human minefield, huh?

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
That's not what happened!

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
I just thought I should crush
any future business rivals

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
early on in the game!

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
It's unusual to see someone
who has as few friends as you.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
On that fateful day,

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
I started working hard
to defeat Ronaldo.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Talk about wasting
your whole adolescence.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
By ingesting blood pills,
we dhampirs are able to

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
give our physical
abilities a hefty boost,

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
but the effect is temporary.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
Using these abilities,

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
I dug pitfalls on
Ronaldo's route to school.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
For real?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] I wrote propaganda
about him with desks!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
And bought all the
bread at the school store

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
before Ronaldo got any!

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.848 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Why would that
require heightened ability?

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.975 position:50% align:center
Also, who took these pictures?

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] There was
a newspaper club member--

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.437 position:50% align:center
a total weirdo--
who followed me around.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] The article
looks like an exposé!

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
So, these are the chronicles of

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
how you were basically
a pain in Ronaldo's ass?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
"pain in his ass"? You moron!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
Hah! Okay, then,

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
why don't I tell you
about how I saved that guy?

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center

he's been no match for me.

Let me hear it!

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Can you go any faster, Ronaldo?!

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
said you'd clean up.

doing it, too, damn it?

Ronaldo, say cheese.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
You should help, too, Kameya.

Right, you can handle the rest.

We can break down the door!

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
No way. It's metal.

You'll never succeed as a hunter

to be aware of danger!

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make any sense!
Get outta my face!

00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] That would be
a vampire! What's it doing here?

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.139 position:50% align:center
Oh, jeez! Now what?

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA]
Someone!

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
Take a picture with
the whole thing in frame!

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
The flash setting's fine as-is.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Whoa, Kameya!

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
You'll definitely make it
with that attitude!

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
Get off of him! Jiggly bastard!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
Hey, man, are you okay?

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
[LAND CLIONE squealing]

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
I just had some
blood sucked out of me.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
But my clothes
are a little melted.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Kameya!

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[KAMEYA] Take a picture of me.
I'll use it as a victim photo.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Have some self-respect, my dude!

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Crap, they'll think
we all wear high-cut briefs!

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Calm down, you idiot!

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
You call yourself
a future hunter?

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
Before whining about it,
you should defeat this thing!

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Okay, but how?

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
Kicking it didn't
seem to do anything.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Look, I have a plan.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Ten seconds...
Distract that thing for a bit!

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Uh, right!

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.898 position:50% align:center
Damn it. You punk!

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yells]

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Let go, you glorified jellyfish!

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
[HANDA yells]

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
[LAND CLIONE whimpers, shrieks]

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.454 position:50% align:center
Eyes up her,e you fool.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
See, most vampires
are vulnerable to fire.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thanks for saving me.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
I have one note, though.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
I think it'd be better
if you'd done it sooner.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A]
Hey, is anyone in there?

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO gasps]
--[HANDA] Hm?

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A] Did you get
yourselves locked in?

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A yells]

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
It's not what you think!

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A]
What're you boys doing?!

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
No, there was a vampire here!

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A]
Kameya, you, too?!

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Right, Handa? Handa?!

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 05A]
Is this some kind of ritual?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.521 position:50% align:center
Like, a Warlock's Sabbath
or something?

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
It is not a sabbath!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
That was one of the
more interesting events.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It's hard to
tell whether Ronaldo

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
was actually saved, or not.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
But I do think he feels that
he's indebted to you somehow.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
Hah. Naturally.

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
One question:

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
why would an inferior vampire
be in a school shed?

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.249 position:50% align:center
Because I brought it
there, that's why!

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.500 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Guilty!

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo was supposed to
be trapped there alone.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
Little oversight.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
Still it all worked out!

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
It was hilarious watching
that clueless dupe

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
thank me in that
high-cut bodysuit!

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yells]

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center

[JOHN squeaks]

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
You think we can get them
to pay for the window this time?

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
That might be a difficult sell.

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
We're up against my family.

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
I am a hunter, you know!

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] He's the strongest,
most troublesome

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.081 position:50% align:center
vampire in the family.
