I'm here for a consultation?

Great, welcome. Come on in.

[RONALDO, JOHN scream]

What? What're you?
What kind of creature are you?

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
Some new kind of bioterrorism?

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
What is wrong, Ronaldo?
Why so loud--?

[DRALUC gasps, grunts]

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.286 position:50% align:center
I understand why
that would kill you.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Oh, a compatriot!

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.082 position:50% align:center
I suppose this means
the rumors were true!

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
Wha--? "Compatriot"?
Does that mean that you're a--?

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Yes.
As you can see, I'm a vampire.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] No offense,
but that is not what I see.

[ODD CREATURE grunts]

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Sorry for
neglecting to introduce myself.

I am the vampire commonly
known as Aud von Kreatur.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.486 position:50% align:center
I'm aware it's quite strange,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center

me "Odd Creature."

You call yourself that?

[RONALDO]
Ehem! Well, then?

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
What in the world could
a vampire want with me?

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.080 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] I thought a
hunter familiar with vampires

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
would be the ideal candidate
to help me with my problem.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
On top of that, you've even
teamed up with a vampire,

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
so I know you're open-minded.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
I had no choice

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.509 position:50% align:center
but to take advantage
of such a bizarre idiot!

[RONALDO]
Can I punch this guy?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Whatever.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Anyway, what did you need?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE laughs]
Isn't it obvious?

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.144 position:50% align:center
My problem is the way I look!
You are an idiot!

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Really, can I punch this guy?!

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Actually,
it's not quite as simple

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
as not liking my looks.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
I'm a vampire who can
appear however I choose.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
The only trouble is that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
I'm not very good at
controlling my power.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
I'm quite bad, in fact.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
I don't expect much from you,
but I was hoping you could

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
just help me improve
upon this a little.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
Even his dumb explanation

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
gets on my very
last freaking nerve.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
Is it possible to have so little
control over your own power?

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
It's not that unusual,
as a matter of fact.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
You will find that
transformation is among

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
the most complex of a vampire's
supernatural powers.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
One small misstep

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
and you'll turn into something
strange, unable to change back.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
Now, kill me.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You could've just told me!

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50% align:center
I get the situation now,

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
but whether I can help
is another matter.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
If there's a possibility that
you'll use that power for evil,

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
then so help me, I'll stop you--

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
weird creature fetish
or something?

Stop you!

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
Why'd you transform into
something so disgusting?

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE] Pardon, my power
is going out of control.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
What do you mean
out of control?!

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
You suddenly got all huge and
grotesque!

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE]
What? Did you say

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
you're really turned
on by my size?

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center

are you talking about?!

[ODD CREATURE sighs]
Oh dear, please excuse me.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
When my power slips
beyond my control,

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
I transform into
something truly bizarre.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
But when I think of
something perverted,

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.686 position:50% align:center
my power runs off without me!

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:30.770 position:50% align:center

TMI!

[ODD CREATURE]
On the way here today,

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.940 position:50% align:center
I saw the Kanagawa
Prefecture logo

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
and turned into this
thing you see now.

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Like a teenage boy!

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
You piss me off,
but unless this stops,

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
you're a veritable menace.

[ODD CREATURE] So, you're saying
I need to stop

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
getting brain boners in public?

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] I didn't put it like
that, but yes!

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to do that?

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
Draluc could send you a nude.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
How rude!

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
You barely changed at all!

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE]
Well, it did make me limp,

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
but when you put it
in my face like that,

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
it's just not enough of
a shock to do the trick.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're not nearly
as emaciated as I expected.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Let go of me, Ronaldo.
I'm going to slap him. I must!

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
It's not worth it.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center

turning in to sand.

to make your
brain boner go limp,

what if we distracted
you instead?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center

cute animal?

have John's head now?!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.050 position:50% align:center
[ODD CREATURE]
When I saw his roundness,

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
it reminded me of boobs,
and then this happened.

Oh, no... John's really shocked!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
Can you blame him? I mean,
his own face just told him

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
his roundness was
reminiscent of boobs.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center

Shut up!

Stop messing around!
Do you even wanna control this?

it won't be long before

you up and kills you!

I hope they catch you, idiot!

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
One moment, Ronaldo.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
I've got it.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
It appears that even the most
trivial, mundane suggestion

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
will drive you crazy.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
Though you're a pervert,

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
there's no evidence
of sexual experience!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
In other words, you are a late
bloomer who's never scored,

Who? Me?!

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
Making a guy like that
go limp and control himself,

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
is like expecting a middle-
school boy to reach nirvana.

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
You can't!

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Instead, you should be building
up experience and tolerance

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
to sexual thoughts!

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
Treating it with immersion
rather than abstinence.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
Why, what novel idea!

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
Take this! It's like shock
therapy for perverts!

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
Is this your personal
collection, Ronaldo?

at an amazing speed!

to the stimulus

Oh, my.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
your carefree days
are officially over.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
Handa? Why are you here?

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
Uh, Ronaldo, who is this man?

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.699 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's just
an old acquaintance,

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
who happens to be a dhampir.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
He uses his ability as
a member of Vamp Control.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
He's an annoying turd

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
who will jump at the
slightest chance to rush me.

00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
I thought Hinaichi was
supposed to be com--

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Vice-Captain Hinaichi is busy!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
I'm here in her place.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
Are you disappointed that
I'm not a pretty woman?

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.218 position:50% align:center
You think with that
tiny thing in your pants!

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
If the law permitted,
I'd chop it clean off!

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Too close!
And I think you're projecting!

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
[HANDA chuckles]
You get off easy this time.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
I'm not even here for you.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.479 position:50% align:center
I came for that vampire.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC yelps]

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
I'll interrogate you thoroughly
to ensure you aren't dangerous.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
You'd better prepare yourself!

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
Save me, Ronaldo! I beg of you!

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Step away from him!

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
I need to clean.
I'm embarrassed. Gimme a sec!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I suppose I'm just
chopped liver to you.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
I need to begin.
Out of my way, Ronaldo.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
Leave us at once.

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
You might put ideas in his head.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
Now, listen up, vampire!

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
You try lying or keeping
secrets, I'll kill you!

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
You got that?

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
This is oppression by
a government entity!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
Listen, idiot. If you
tell that guy anything

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.475 position:50% align:center
that'll make trouble for me,
I'll kill you! You got that?

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC yelps]
Why's everybody wanna kill me?

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
Well? You have me now.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
So what do you want
me to talk about?

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
I'm searching the house, stupid.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
What does it look like?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
I know. I meant
why are you doing that?

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
I thought you wanted
to ask me questions.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
I truly couldn't
care less about you!

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Then what did you come here for?

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] I came in the
guise of observing you

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
to find Ronaldo's weakness!

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.631 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Well, honesty is a virtue,

00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
but what has Ronaldo
ever done to you?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
I could list hundreds of
reasons why I should kill him.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
Above all,

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
I must avenge my mother!

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.977 position:50% align:center
[HANDA sighs]

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
My mother was once
a noble vampire.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
But she became obsessed with

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
<i>The War Chronicles of Ronaldo</i>
and is a huge fan now!

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ugh! That sucks.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.990 position:50% align:center
Ya know what's worse?

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
I went to high school with
the guy! Can you imagine?!

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
Hearing the excitement build
in your own mother's voice,

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
talking about your classmate?!

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
It's only natural that I would

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
wanna beat the
stupid bastard to death!

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?! [yells]

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
Stop taking your
anger out on me!

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] I'll expose
his shame to the world

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
and erase him from society!

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
I won't rest until I bring my
mom to her senses!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
Your breath stinks!

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] Now that you understand
where I'm coming from,

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
tell me all the
secrets you know!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
No, I refuse.
If Ronaldo is destroyed,

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
then we will no longer
have a place to live.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
What if I gave you this?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
It's a limited edition of the
new <i>Age of Vampires</i> game.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
O, descendant of my compatriot,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
I shall give you
what you desire.

[HANDA] That guy's weaknesses,
his secrets, anything!

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.705 position:50% align:center
Tell me!

00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
Let me see. One,
Ronaldo doesn't like celery.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
Two, he likes big boobs.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
Don't play! Those are
both common knowledge!

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Really?

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Idiot.

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
First, about the celery.

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
On pages 152 and 215 of <i>The</i>
<i>Ronaldo Chronicles</i> volume one--

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
This guy is a certified weirdo!

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.018 position:50% align:center
Anyway, can't you tell me

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
anything scandalous,
or embarrassing at least?

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
Something like he
wanders the streets at night

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
in nothing but a hat,
boots, and gloves?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.362 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC sighs] If he did,
I would have left long ago.

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
[HANDA]
Damn it! You're no help.

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll have to search
the whole house on my own.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Would you stop?

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
has to clean that up!

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.831 position:50% align:center
I need to clean.
I'm embarrassed. Gimme a sec!

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
--[DRALUC] Hm.
--[HANDA] What?

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
Did you think of something?

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I'm the one who
always cleans the house.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
So, what did Ronaldo
have to clean up?

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
And, he seemed so panicked
when you tried to go in.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
It's not good to keep
secrets from your teammate.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
It might get in the way
of our work, you know?

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
This sounds promising.
I tip my hat off to you, sir.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
It's something he could
hide in a short amount of time.

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
Documents proving tax evasion?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] All right!
Let's split up and look!

[RONALDO grumbles]

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
I'm getting restless. Hm?

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.582 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lord Dral, I--

00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?!

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
Idiot! We were just playing
a game of hide-and-seek!

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
In my house?!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Is John panicking 'cause
he can't move fast enough

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
to find a hiding place?
Poor little John!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] Shut your mouth!
He panicked because you came in!

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
Now get out!

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Yeah! We were having
so much fun before you came in!

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
Hide-and-seek? When did you
two become such good buddies?

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
Okay, I get it.
I know when I'm not wanted.

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
They're excluding me!
That hurts my feelings!

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[HANDA grunts]
Looks like we dodged a bullet.

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
Eh, good thing he's an idiot.
Let's finish this quickly.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Hm? This closet is
locked. What's that about?

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
Say what?! Could his
secret be in here?

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Hey, Lord Dral,
I forgot to ask you--

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Haven't you heard of the cactus?

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
One of the most well-known
cheerleading stunts of all time!

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
I know, but why the
hell are you doing it now?

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
Why do you keep coming in?!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
Stay in your lane!
What's wrong with you?!

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
I got hungry, so I just
came in for a snack!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
I'll bring you some rice balls!
Now go away, dammit!

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center

Aww! You guys are big meanies!

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
He's being quite troublesome.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
John, please deliver
the rice balls,

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
and then keep
Ronaldo out of here.

[JOHN grunts]

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
Heh. Stupid Ronaldo, do you
honestly think you can stop

00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
the Vampire Lord Draluc with
naught but a measly little lock?

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
Now give me a
good chop right here.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center

through the gaps of the door.

I can't open the lock
from the inside!

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
It's so cramped in here!

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[HANDA] Jackass! Hit your head
on something in there and die!

[RONALDO]
What are you saying, John?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you saying, "Let's play
a game together, Ronaldo"?

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
You're trying to cheer me up?

You really are a good egg, John!

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Hey, you bullies! What did you
bastards do to sweet little--?

[RONALDO gasps]
Stop it!

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
Don't touch those!

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center

Uh, yeah, I...

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be shocked if
you happened to see all those.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Your mom writes me tons of
letters, my man.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
[HANDA groans, screams]

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center

[HINAICHI]
Hm?

You have a call

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI sighs]

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center

[RONALDO]
It's Ronaldo.

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.356 position:50% align:center
