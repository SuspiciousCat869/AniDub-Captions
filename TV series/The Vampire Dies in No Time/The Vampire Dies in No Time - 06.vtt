Help! Please help me!

Uh, okay, but who are you?

[DRALUC]
Hey, Ronaldo, this is--

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.810 position:50% align:center
I'll explain all that later!
I'm being chased!

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
Just hide me, please! Hurry!

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
This is so sudden!
I can't think of anywhere!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
How about up in the ceiling?

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Why are you being
chased? Who are you?

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
Who's after you?

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
Shh! Be quiet, she's down there.

Adamppi. Where are you?

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Sand.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Come bite me!

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.357 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI] Is being a
late-blooming blood sucker

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
really even a thing?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll just have
to turn into a vampire

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.364 position:50% align:center
so I can stay by your side.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI] Hurry up
and come out! Bite me!

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC, RONALDO]
What the hell?

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Now tell us who you are!

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.460 position:50% align:center
Talk, already!

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
Why is that woman
chasing you around?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Ronaldo.
This man is a--

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll talk.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.384 position:50% align:center
My name is Adam. I'm a vampire.

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
What?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:58.720 position:50% align:center
I'm a fool.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
A vampire who has been trying to
make a life among humans.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
You are a fool; why would
a vampire seek refuge here?

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.103 position:50% align:center
Who was that brave
lady, compatriot?

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
[ADAM sighs] It's a long
story, but it here goes.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Two months ago,
I was down and out--

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
wandering the streets of
Shin-Yokohama starving.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 06A]
And then he--

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI]
And then he what?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
[GIRL 06A]
Oh, sorry, I got distracted...

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] A cute,
delicious-looking young lady!

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
If I make friends with her,
she might let me suck her blood.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Hey there, gorgeous!

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
You're really cute.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna maybe go
grab a bite to eat with me?

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.254 position:50% align:center
Wow, forward much?

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
S-Sure, if you promise not
to try anything weird.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
No! I wasn't talking to you!

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI]
Oh, my God, you're so hot!

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
My name is Maremi Gekkoin!
Nice to meet you!

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
I want your number,
sexy! Tell me!

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Help me!

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] I panicked,
Blurted out, "I'm a vampire!"

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
That backfired, and she
started following me around,

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
begging me to bite her.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
Please, help me get rid of her!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
Go home.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.367 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
But you hunt down solutions
to vampire problems--

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
that's what I heard!

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.830 position:50% align:center
Where'd you hear that,
in a game of "telephone"?

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
This is just foolish,
misguided passion.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] S-Stop! Please!
Don't go down yet!

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I was in the
middle of a game. Hmph.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI]
A presence!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
Just let me love you,
please. Please!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.428 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. This isn't him.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
Who's this, slipping
silkily from my grasp?

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
Adamppi, you meanie!

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
Bite me!

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
As her love grows and
her passion intensifies,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
she gets more aggressive.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.188 position:50% align:center
That's scary.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
You see? You have to help me!

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
Are you dumb?

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
anyone can do about this!

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Fine, then I'll just skip town!

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
You can help me make a getaway
without her getting wise to it!

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
I swear I'm gonna have
to change my title

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
from Vampire Hunter
to Idiot Magnet!

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
All right, look:

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
you can get to the hallway
upstairs from right there.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
While that freak's
stalking the office,

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
run down the stairs
and keep on running.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
Then, you're on your own, man.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I owe you one.

[JOHN crying]

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] John, we'll
collect Lord Dral later.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
Come here!

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] All right,
the coast looks clear.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Come on, keep your voice down!

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
She's in the choir
at her college,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
so she's got really good ears.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
We have to be quiet.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
Why do you know things
like that about her?

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
Well, she kinda forced
her dating profile on me.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
[MAREMI]
Ohh...

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
Adamppi! Found you!

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
Enough hide and seek--I won!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
But it's a win-win, 'cause I'm
gonna let you suck my blood!

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
Then I'll become
a vampire like you,

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
and you and I will be
together forever and ever

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center

It's fine! That's not necessary!

If you want me to love you,
don't hold back!

[DRALUC]
I told you, not this year.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
I cannot attend
the New Year's party.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS] What? But I'm
your father! I miss you!

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
I'll be in
Shin-Yokohama, Father.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS] Then we'll bring the
party to you!

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
We can rent out
the Vrince Hotel.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I have plans with the
human I was telling you about.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS]
Bring that human with you.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
I'll give him
a New Year's gift, too.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ronaldo,
do you want to come

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
to my family's New Year's party?

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
Have you gone insane?!

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
Well, Father, I shall
see you at the party.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
I am a <i>vampire hunter</i> . You do
know what that means, don't you?

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
That's like inviting a ball of
boric acid to a cockroach party.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] We simply won't
tell them you're a hunter.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
I only want to introduce you
to my family... as my friend!

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I know what you actually want!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Is that what you think of me?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
I think it'll be a good story
for <i>The Ronaldo Chronicles</i> .

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
Can it, moro--

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Wait a minute,
a gathering of vampires.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.334 position:50% align:center
As a hunter,
I should supervise them.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
If I don't go,
and they raise hell,

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
everyone will say it's my fault!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
I'll stop by, but that's it.

Ah, Draluc!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
My son, how I have missed you!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
Long time no see!

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Here's your New Year's gift.

Here's one for John, too.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, John, I'll hold onto
yours until we get back home.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
I take it Mother
is still working?

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid so.
Mira is always so busy.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
Why, hello there, human male.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
I've heard much
about you from Draluc.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
Ah. Oh, hello.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA] He tells me
you're a pole dancer?

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO gasps]
I'm gonna kill you, Draluc.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.012 position:50% align:center
So, how did a pole dancer

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
come to be acquainted
with Draluc?

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Yep, gonna kill you,
bastard. Five times in a row.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Uh, funny story.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I met him
while he was performing

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
in front of the station.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
Like, a pole dance?

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You bastard!

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
Oh, I mean, excuse us a moment.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.610 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA gasps]

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
Don't say that we met
at the station!

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.363 position:50% align:center
What in the hell?

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
What am I supposed to say?

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
Should I tell them how
we destroyed the castle?

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Don't drudge
up the distant past!

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
That castle belonged to
my grandfather originally.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
I figure he'd be kind
of mad that it was ruined.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
"Kind of mad"?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
I think that would be
putting it mildly, don't you?

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] You were complicit
in the castle's destruction.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
You should get your story
straight, for your own sake.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
Did you forget
that I'm a hunter?

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Even if you and your whole
family ganged up on me,

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be scared!

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] We're a family
that's friendly to humans.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Even if they do find out
the castle is gone,

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.770 position:50% align:center
my father and the others
won't get violent.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
But that's not to say they
wouldn't sue you, though.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Come on!

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
So, we have to
hide the truth from them.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
You can pretend to be
a pole dancer for one night!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
You just think it's funny!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center

Hello again, human male.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
Uh... So, you're--

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
I am Draluc's aunt, Gorgona.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
Oh, my name is--

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA] If I search your name
online, will I get any hits?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
You're a pole dancer in
Shin-Yokohama, right?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
My name's Pole, I mean, Paul.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah, uh, Paul McCartney.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
Great name.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
It just sounds like a pole
dancer, know what I mean?

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] That was close!
If she'd searched my real name,

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
<i>The Ronaldo Chronicles</i>
would've come up.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
She'd've found out I was
a hunter. Not only that--

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
I wrote about destroying
Castle Draluc in there!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:14.150 position:50% align:center
If anyone here reads it,
I'd be sued for sure!

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
Huh, nothing...
Except some Brit.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm just a
third-rate pole dancer.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA]
What else could I search?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
People you've performed with?
Places you've performed?

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Why are you so
obsessed with my pole dancing?

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.079 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hey, why are you yelling, Rona--

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.331 position:50% align:center

Hey, John's feeling lonely!

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center

[DRALUC]
That's a good name.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
Do you want your family

Oh. Sorry.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS] "Rona"? Why would
you call him that?

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, this guy's pole-dancing
nickname is Rope Nasty.

are you teaching my son?!

He's the improper one here!

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
Now, Draus, we do not
kink shame around here.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
Unless his fetish hurts others.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] What kind of
help am I getting here?

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA]
I, for one, cannot wait

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
to see this young man's
pole dance and bondage play.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
There's not even
a pole to dance on!

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Um, Draluc, why be friends
with a deviant like him?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
His pole dancing is
revolutionary;

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
he's created a new artform.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
As an art lover, I'm curious:

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
what are you expressing
through your pole dancing?

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hell if I know!

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
Uh, the four seasons
here in Japan?

S-Sand.

Don't die laughing!

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
The vicissitudes of passing
time shown through pole dance?

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
And Draluc was able to pick up
on those subtle nuances?

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
I'd expect nothing less.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Don't you know
crap when you smell it?

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] I was an idiot to
think I should supervise this.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
No! Grandfather really
is hard to deal with!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.919 position:50% align:center
His stamina and energy
are like that of a monster,

00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
and he makes the
whole family go along

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
with his hobbies and whims!

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Next we ride bikes!

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
At last year's New Year's party,

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
he forced the whole family
to complete a triathlon

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
because he thought
it would be fun!

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
He's like a nightmare boss.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
This year, I brought my own

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
homemade board game.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
--[VAMPIRES] No!
--[DRAUS] Who does that?!

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
No one wants to play that!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR] But wait, I even
brought prizes for the winners,

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
like a flat-screen TV,
a fancy noodle maker,

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
and a live dairy cow.

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
Ooh, and this book set
the bookstore recommended.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.619 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO screams]

00:15:11.703 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
Whoa. What's the matter, Paul?

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Is this your favorite series?

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's it.

00:15:17.292 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
If anyone else wins the game...

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] ...and gets <i>The Ronaldo</i>
<i>Chronicles</i> as a prize...

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
...they'll read it...

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
...and find out everything.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Grandfather, is it
possible to just take a prize?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
That would be cheating.

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
So, it's come down
to this, has it?

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.692 position:50% align:center
We have to beat this old man
at his own game. Literally.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
The game he made solely to
amuse himself, apparently.

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
Then we must claim
my books as our prize,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.158 position:50% align:center
or your family will find out
we torched the castle and sue.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
Do your best!

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I don't want
them to find out, either!

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
And, yes,
this is no normal game.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
We are up against
my family here.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Unlike me, they're all
vampires with great power--

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
formidable adversaries!

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
They're at my father's level,

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
and he can use pretty
much all vampire abilities.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
So, that's why everybody's
so serious about this?

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.304 position:50% align:center
'Cause they're scared?

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that just great?

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Of course they're scared.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
Grandfather is comfortably

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
situated at the
head of the family.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Whew.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.938 position:50% align:center
Well, for starters,

00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
the entertainment Grandfather
picks is never safe.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
Somebody's gotta
stop him, dammit!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
Do you think we haven't tried?

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Here are the rules.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
You are the game pieces.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
You'll roll the die and move
that number of spaces.

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Like so.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
One, two, and three.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
Flip the panel where you land
and then do what it says.

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Panel, open.

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Sand!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Now, let us begin.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
No way!

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
So we know a three means death.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
They could all mean
death for all we know!

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Let's find the safe
spaces and only use those!

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] I have an idea,
Father, let's play as a team.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center
How about this: I roll the die,
and you can be the game piece.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You shitty bastard!

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Daddy will try, son.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
--[DRALUC] Yay!
--[RONALDO] Don't baby him!

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaking]

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Father, it's a five!

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
All right, good job.
We have escaped the landmine.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
Two, three, four, five!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
And panel, open!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
It-It's warm in here.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Father, no!

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
I am so sorry, Draluc.
I've failed you as a father.

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?
This will be big trouble for me!

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get out of there!

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.518 position:50% align:center
You scum!

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
You're next, Gorgona.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA] I don't want
to repeat Draus's failure.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
I'll use my power
to manipulate the die.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
Yes, a six! That will do!

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
I'll just go on
ahead, Draus. [laughs]

00:17:58.787 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS]
So warm.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA]
Quite relaxing.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Paul, you're next!

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO screams]

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] I have a
50 percent chance of dying!

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
[yells] Daddy doesn't
wanna die, die!

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
All right! Good job, me!

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
I'm unstoppable!

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO growls]

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
So, now we know the
bunny space is safe!

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
That beats the landmine any day!

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
You must roll a four
at all costs!

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Dignity is such a fragile thing.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Now, who will roll next?

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center
[STELLA] Predict the traps
with super-intuition.

00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
[FINN] Manipulate the die
with psychokinesis.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
[LUNA]
I got a four!

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
[EDDIE]

[RONALDO grunts, yelps]

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
All right!

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
Only five more spaces to-- Ah...

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
--to the goal, meow.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.305 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR] I'm so glad
you're enjoying the game.

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much, meow!

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Rona-- Er, Paul.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
We can win this thing!

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
If one of us gets a five,
then we're done!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
Right, Father, let's
put an end to this.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
Yes, I am counting on you, son.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Meow.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
Draluc Dice Roll! Hah, hah!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.371 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You idiot, meow!

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
[GORGONA] 
h, look.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
I caught up to you. Meow.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yelps]

[RONALDO]
Crap, crap, crap!

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
If I don't win this right now,
then it's over for me!

Paul, you're up next.

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center

Hell yeah!

[PROGENITOR]
Congrats, choose your prize.

00:19:57.989 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
I recommend the cow.

[COW 06A grunts]

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:03.078 position:50% align:center
No! I'd rather have
these awesome books!

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Well then, let's continue

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
until everyone finishes.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
Nah, we're cool
just to end it here.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
Someone already won!

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
Three cheers for Paul! Meow!

Glad that's over with.

Yes, excellent work,

I'll kill you.

[PROGENITOR] Speaking of
cleaning up, on the way here, 

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
I stopped by Draluc's castle
and found it blown to bits.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
What on earth happened to it?

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
What? Blown to smithereens?

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
It was completely destroyed.

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS yelps]

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo did it, not me!

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
Wha--?!

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.983 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] He's actually
the Vampire Hunter, Ronaldo,

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
and--oh, you can find all the
details written in this book.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS, PROGENITOR]
Hmm?

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
It... It's all over.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
Wha... What should I do?

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
Ask them not to sue me?

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Eliminate them
before they try to sue?

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
No, that's too much,
even for me.

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.084 position:50% align:center
[DRAUS]
I mean, Ronaldo!

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
I read your books,
and I must tell you,

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
I was incredibly moved!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
Draluc has been weak
ever since he was a child,

00:20:58.216 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
so I didn't think he would
ever be able to live on his own.

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
My son has grown strong enough
to fight alongside a hunter?

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
My Draluc works as your equal,

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
eliminating our
evil compatriots?

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
In the face of such
radical transformation,

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
what's a little castle?

[RONALDO]
Do you hear yourself right now?!

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
It's just a castle. It's fine.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
For real?!

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
Well then, why don't we close

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
with three cheers?

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
[VAMPIRES]
Yeah!

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.408 position:50% align:center
Funny how that worked out!

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
I'll count on you from now on.

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:29.873 position:50% align:center
Draluc!

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
No!

Arise, Draluc.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Yes?

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
[PROGENITOR]
I hope you will always

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
cherish your human friend.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
Yes, grandfather.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Is this some kind of metaphor?

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.581 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Whatever you do,
don't touch that guy's beam!
