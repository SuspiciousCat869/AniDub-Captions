[DRALUC] This is more
interesting than I expected.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.180 position:50% align:center
You were so full of yourself

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
that you gave me your
autobiography when we met,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:19.060 position:50% align:center
but this isn't bad--Sand.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center
I will kill you.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
I mean it!

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
Your experience as a hunter

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
translates well into quite
an entertaining narrative.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Shut up!

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.449 position:50% align:center
Your brown-nosed flattery
is pissing me off!

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
Also, I bought some Hokkaido
Special Select Milk.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.286 position:50% align:center
You can have it if you want.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You're an easy mark.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
You'd buy ocean-front property
in Mongolia over the phone.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
Who're you to
call me an easy mark?

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
Yello, Ronaldo here--

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
Hello, it's me, Fukuma,
from Autumn Books.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts]

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hm?

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
The manuscript for

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
<i>The War Chronicles of</i>
<i>Ronaldo Volume 2</i> --

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
Is it ready yet?

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:02.395 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Thanks to the popularity

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.534 position:50% align:center
of <i>The Ronaldo Chronicles</i> ,

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
a second volume is
scheduled to be released!

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
The manuscript for
that was due today!

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.834 position:50% align:center
Later. I'll be going
into hiding now.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Did you forget about it?

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I've had a lot going
on lately, mostly 'cause of you!

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
My only options now
are to flee the country

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.301 position:50% align:center
or to hide out in
an underground bunker!

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
Or you could apologize
and start writing it now.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
You've never incurred Mr.
Fukuma's unbridled wrath, man!

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
You don't know how he can be!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Is Mr. Fukuma the
person who called earlier?

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.855 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
Mr. Fukuma is the editor
for <i>The Ronaldo Chronicles</i> .

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
He's young, but capable
and confident--

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
the top editor at Autumn Books.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
Sounds like he's way
too good for you.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Fighting style:

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
Fist of the South Star
Editorial Battle-Axe.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
Weapon: Battle-Axe--
hence the name.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center
What the--?!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
Why does an editor have mastery

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
over such a scary
fighting style?

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
Everyone who works
at Autumn Books does.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
It's a prerequisite
to get the job.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] What kinda
weird policy is that?!

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
Soon after I first
met Mr. Fukuma,

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.219 position:50% align:center
I started writing my book,

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
but it was just something
I was doing in my free time.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA] Ronaldo, your progress
on the manuscript seems slow.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, sorry! My day job's
been keeping me busy.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
Is that so?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
[VOICE 02A]
Wow!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I vow to do better.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
One should meet their deadlines

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
in any job they
choose to take on.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
That day, I decided that I
would never defy him again.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
If he finds out I haven't
written anything yet,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
he'll chop off what's in my
pants this time, and I'll die!

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
And if I survived that,
I'd have to live as a lady!

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Oh, Ronalina.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Nope. Stop.
I don't want to imagine it.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
That's what will happen--

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
--[phone rings]
--[RONALDO screams]

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Uh, yes, this is Ronaldo!

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA] This is Fukuma.
How's the manuscript going?

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, you know, it's uh--

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
I simply can't wait to devour

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
the next installment
in the series.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Thanks. What's that banging
noise in the background?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA] Oh, I'm testing
the strength of the door

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
on the new iron
maiden I purchased.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
He's gonna kill me!

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA] I heard you've
teamed up with a vampire,

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
so I'm particularly interested
in reading about that aspect.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
Um, well, it's, ah, I mean, uh--

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
No! Draluc, don't hurt me!

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
Are you all right, Ronaldo?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunting]
Draluc!

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
He's attacking me--

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO groaning]

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:07.599 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Don't--Don't worry
about me or the manuscript!

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA] Are you going
to be okay, Ronaldo?

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Yes, but the manuscript, uh--

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
I understand.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
I'll be right over to eliminate
that pesky vampire.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
If I get rid of him, you'll have
the manuscript for me, right?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
Hah?

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
[phone clicks, beeps]

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
I don't want to enter a
death pact with you, you idiot!

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
You die alone!

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I had no
idea he'd react that way!

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
John, please help me!

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
Protect me!

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Hey, don't put pressure on John!

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
You don't have to sacrifice
yourself for him, John!

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
So what do we do?

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
Once Mr. Fukuma gets here,
you and I are toast!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
We must devise a plan
to avert this disaster!

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:49.432 position:50% align:center
This may be futile, but let's
power up the eye-beam thingy.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
You've got dozens
of those at home--

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.310 position:50% align:center
why didn't you
bring all of them?!

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Stop yelling!
Quiet down and help me plan!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts] Uh. Okay,
I dunno, what if we, uh, uh--

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
Light a bunch of fires around
the agency or something?!

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
What'll that do?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
I can't think! I can't think!
I can't think! I can't think!

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
Cats! Get a bunch of cute
kitties and surround him--

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Calm down! Take a deep breath!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.620 position:50% align:center
The fastest thing
would be to just run away!

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.122 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
--[footstep]
--Or hide--

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
Run.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't be stupid.
There's no way he could get from

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center
Tokyo to Shin-Yokohama
that fast. [chuckles]

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I can hear his battle-axe

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
dragging on the ground!

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.196 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
This is your problem, not mine!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
You deserve to be
chopped up for your lies!

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Can't you be my decoy?

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo Junior won't
regenerate like you!

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[BOTH scream]

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
A blackout! What?!

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Oh no, the eye-beam
thingy went into sleep mode!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yells]
Where's the flashlight?!

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Where's the flashlight?!

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
What kind of dumb human
runs around in the dark--?

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Wait! I can see in the dark,

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
so what's to stop me
from escaping on my own?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
Farewell, Ronaldo!
I'm abandoning you!

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Oh.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] If I use a flashlight,
he'll be able to see where I am.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
Damn it, where's Mr. Fukuma?

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ronaldo! This way!

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why, is something
over there?

--[RONALDO grunts]
--[DRALUC] Hah!

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center

[FUKUMA]
How very kind of you, Draluc.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.465 position:50% align:center
Hello, there, Ronaldo.
Can I have your manuscript now?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Mr. Fukuma I--

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
How dare you betray me, Draluc!

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC chuckles] Vampires are
supposed to betray hunters.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
Besides... Mr. Fukuma
said they had extra games

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
in the editorial department
I could have, so.

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Whoever heard
of a vampire falling

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.774 position:50% align:center
for childish bribes?!

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
And anyway...

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
Stupid of you to assume you're
strong enough to restrain me!

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center

We should discuss my pay.

Huh?!

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
Is it monthly?

What kind of vampire is it?

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
A creature that the
Vampire Research Center

had captured escaped somehow.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
it's a type of vampire

with the power to
control plant life.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center

put that up and then left.

You underestimate my cunning and
treachery.

It's your tragic flaw,
for I, Draluc,

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.984 position:50% align:center
will hunt down the inferior
vampires before you.

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center

making the whole agency mine

Excellently done,

Oh, take your praise
and shove it!

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Why'd you run off, man? Rude!

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
Fine, but you've got to admit

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
that I worked
pretty hard tonight!

[RONALDO] Hmph. Well, I guess
you did all right.. for you.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
I did, indeed,

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
and you should compensate
me for my work!

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
A million should do it.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
Okay, I think this
is about worth that.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
[YOMOTSUZAKA] I didn't
think it'd work so well.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
It's just a supplement,
after all.

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center

What the hell?!

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.943 position:50% align:center
Why is the lid of your coffin
in the middle of the floor?

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
Ouch! Look, there's blood!

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Oh, your blood?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
Well, that doesn't
sound very appetizing.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
I'll kill you!

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
No offense. For a vampire,
the most delicious blood

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
is the sweet lifeblood
of a young virgin.

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
I'm mad about the lid,
not the insult!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
I have only been
drinking milk lately.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
It's about time I had some
blood that's full of life. Oh.

Good evening.

Evening, sir, might this be
the residence of a Mr. Ronaldo?

Should I call a lawyer?

[POLICE OFFICER 02A]
Why? Have you committed

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
some sort of crime?

we did not come here

So, Hunter Ronaldo,

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
the reason we've come is to
investigate your vampire.

Right, guess we'll
leave it to you, then.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
Thank you for showing
me the way here.

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Well?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
What exactly is it you're
planning to investigate?

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
All you'll find
is that the idiot

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
has the danger level
of an earthworm.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Just a precaution.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
So, tell me then,
has he said anything violent

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
that would indicate a
desire to harm humans?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
You guys love to
worry for no reason.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Nothing like that would
even cross that dummy's mi--

Oh, crap, but it has!

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center

I long to take a bite out of

00:17:51.905 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
the pretty nape

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center

He totally fantasized about

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
causing a human harm earlier!
Oh, this is bad!

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
If she hears that,

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
he might drag me down
with him and ruin my life!

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
Damn it, why did Vamp Control
have to send a woman?

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
And a cute one at that!
This is definitely entrapment!

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
If he sees her, that idiot
will let something slip--

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
no doubt about it!

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
I can't let them meet.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
I can feel it: if he
gets one glimpse of her,

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
this is all gonna end terribly!

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
I gotta think of something!

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.184 position:50% align:center
Something!

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I'll kill him!

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
I'll kill that idiot
before they meet!

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
To do that I have to keep
the girl in the apartment

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.610 position:50% align:center
but away from him.

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
Then find a way
to off him somehow!

I saw a bug,
so I was trying to squash it.

Why do you keep acting like
you've just pulled a fast one?

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] It was another
attempt to kill him,

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
this time with the
vibrations in the floor, but...

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
Maybe vibrations aren't enough?

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
It's hard to tell if he's died
without seeing him.

[DRALUC] Those of my blood
believe that human society,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center

and useful to us,

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.490 position:50% align:center
