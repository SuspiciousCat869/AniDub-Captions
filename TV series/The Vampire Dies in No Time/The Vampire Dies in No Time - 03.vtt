He's guessed that
he's being watched,

pretending to be weak

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
[HINAICHI]
Sure.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
Oh, <i>The Ronaldo</i>
<i>Chronicles Volume Two</i> ?

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.694 position:50% align:center
It's out?

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah, somehow.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
I guess getting tossed into

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
the iron maiden was
worth it in the end.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
Please don't
remind me about that!

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.578 position:50% align:center
I suppose I should
stop by the guild

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
and do a little PR for the book.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
The guild?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
The Hunters' Guild is a group

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
of all the vampire
hunters in the area.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
It's a gathering
place for all of us.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
We go there to trade
information.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
Pick up jobs and stuff.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
Oh? Have fun, then.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
You're coming, too!
I'm introducing you!

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Me, for real?
At a gathering of hunters?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
Wait, this is all so sudden--

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
I don't even have
a special autograph yet.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
It's not a welcoming
party. Relax!

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Why would the hunters
welcome you, anyway?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
You got flowers growing
between your ears?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Speaking of growing,
does my hair look okay?

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Seriously?

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Your hair always looks like the
dad from Sally the Witch, moron!

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Oh, so this is
the hunters' lair, huh?

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Why do you have
to make it sound so sketchy?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
Shin-Yokohama Highball?

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
The guild master's side job.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm comin' in!

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.255 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Hey, welcome in, friend.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
It's been quite
a while, huh, Ronaldo?

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Long time no see, Master.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
Here's volume two of
<i>The Ronaldo Chronicles</i> .

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Thanks for thinking of us.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
I would be happy to
display it here again.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
Who's your companion?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
Is this man the
vampire in question?

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
He's the weakling
who gives me grief.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
Yes, yes. I am
the vampire, Draluc.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
And this place feels
like a dressing room

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
for failed comedians.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You douchebag!

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Shut up! We're not comedians!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
In this business, you have
to make yourself stand out!

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
And costume upkeep
is expensive, damn you!

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
[SHOKA]
Yeah, those fees add up.

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:39.621 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, these people
act just like you.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] If you're not careful,
I'll tape your big mouth shut!

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
Seems weird for a vampire
to team up with you.

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.543 position:50% align:center
Kinda suspicious.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
Isn't that fratricide?

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
Fratricide? How impertinent.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
The only ones
we consider brethren

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
are those of the same blood.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
[JOHN squeaks]

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
And those of my blood

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
believe that human society is
convenient and useful to us

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
and should be preserved.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.894 position:50% align:center
So, we want the
inferior vampires

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
and foolish
compatriots who do harm

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
to that society
to be driven away!

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
In other words,
humans are just fun,

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
so we're happy to help
your species thrive.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
You should be very grateful
to us, if anything!

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
[SHOT] It's kind of refreshing
that he's so shameless.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ow!

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
Until I finish my business here,

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.412 position:50% align:center
don't move or talk--
just stay dead, y'got it?

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Fine, jeez.
You're so high-strung!

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
This is important to me
and I don't need you--

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Good evening. Why are
you wearing a baseball uniform?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
Do you play?

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] I said shut up or die!
That's none of your business!

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.842 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
I was just curious.

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
It's not my fault you're such a
funny band of merrymakers.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I'll kill you!

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
'Sup bro! I'm Homerun Batter.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
I'm a hunter who fights
with a bat and ball!

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
The bat's fine, but hitting
vampires with a ball is hard!

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] You really don't
have to be nice to him, Batter!

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
Hi, what's your name again?
The arm guy?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.277 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess.
My name's Satetsu--

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Stop wandering away!

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
What's that you're wearing?

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
Can I see what you
look like under there?

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Have some freaking boundaries!

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.493 position:50% align:center
That is such a
violation, you dunce!

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Vamone is a really strong
and popular hunter, you know!

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] Oh my, Ronaldo!
It's been an age!

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
Oh, is this another hunter?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.837 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
Gah! Who is this?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
He is presh!

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC shrieks]

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.842 position:50% align:center
This is that vampire, right?

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness,
he's so sweet! What a dear!

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.264 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, tell them
about those "boundaries"!

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:25.185 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Allow me to introduce
vampire trainer, Sinya Siriski.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
This is a hunter who
hunts down vampires,

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
catches them, and trains
them to obey orders.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Scary!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
Your pallid skin
and emaciated body

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
are right in my strike zone!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
Even as a pile of ashes,
you ooze luxury!

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
No! Th-That tickles!

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] Ronaldo! Give him to me!
I need a new plaything!

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You can't do this to me!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
This isn't funny! You did
team up with me, didn't you?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
I don't care!
We're disbanding now.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
I was getting tired of
protecting you, anyway!

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
You can just leave
John's care to me,

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
and Senya will
take good care of you!

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
'Kay, Sweetie!
Hurry up and change into this!

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
What?! You call
that thing a uniform?!

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
[SATETSU]
Senya. You're being too pushy.

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Can't just break up
a team like that.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Arm Guy!

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
This makes up for you
doing absolutely nothing

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
the other day.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
Uh, wha...?

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Now, now, Ronaldo,
you shouldn't be so quick

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
to dissolve your team,
in my humble opinion.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
So what do you think about
letting me intervene?

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
I will happily play host
for a Senya vs. Ronaldo,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Battle for Draluc Match!

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
No! My fate decided
by a sideshow!

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
As for the battle rules,

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
let's have the first to win
three matches take the prize.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
We'll have the
contestants take turns

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
deciding what to
do for each event.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.546 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO chuckles]

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] All right,
place your bets here,

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
and no pushing, please.
It's a one-drink system.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
[MEDOKI] Master's
a natural-born capitalist!

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
Gentlemen get first pick!

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
So, what will the
first event be, hon?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
You think I'm a gentleman?
Then I pick arm wrestling.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Contestants, positions please.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
Ready, fight!

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Well, I lost.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Ronaldo!

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
Senya, you're strong!
There's no beating you.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
You didn't even try!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
[SENYA chuckles]

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
No!

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, you heartless brute!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Making it Senya's
fault is an excellent strategy.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
I can finally get
some peace and quiet.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Later, Lord Dral.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
Only losers don't try.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
Yeah, put up a fight, dumbass!

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any balls?!

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Enough from the peanut gallery!

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
That bastard!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
He's definitely looking
for a reason to be rid of me.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
This is bad. I need to act fast.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
[KOYUKI]
Circle.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.265 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Now then, what should
we do for the second match?

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
Let's see, how 'bout
a nice game of poker?

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Excellent, I'll be the dealer.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
Poker... Hm...

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.860 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
It's your turn, Ronaldo.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
All right.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.989 position:50% align:center
I can lose with this hand.

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Would you like to draw a card?

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
No, sir. I'm keepin' these.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Whoops! I am just so clumsy!

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
[JOHN grunts]

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Stop trying
to interfere, you idiot!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Right,
I'll turn your cards, then.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
--[HUNTERS, SENYA gasp]
--[MASTER] Ooh, a full house.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
That was a good hand.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:58.838 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
What the--?

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
Yes! [chuckles]

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
[JOHN cheers]

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
Lookie, I have four of a kind!

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Good luck for you,
bad luck for me!

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC groans]

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] That bastard
tried to scheme his way out.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, he messed up.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
All his scheming
was for nothing,

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
and I bet he regrets
it now, that dum--

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hm?

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO gasps]

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] Yes, thanks for your
patience! This is Ronaldo!

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
Hello, Ronaldo.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
I have good news regarding <i>The</i>
<i>Ronaldo Chronicles Volume Two</i> .

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, good news?

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
[FUKUMA]
Yes.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Your teamwork with that vampire
was surprisingly well-received.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
The editor-in-chief wants
more along those lines.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:43.717 position:50% align:center
--[RONALDO] Huh?
--[FUKUMA] With that in mind,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
let's make your hunting
as a team with Draluc

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
a focal point for The Ronaldo
Chronicles from now on.

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
I'm so looking forward to more.
We're counting on you.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
[phone clicks, beeps]

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
You sure bolted out of here!
Who was that?

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] What would you
like to do for the next game?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.157 position:50% align:center
Will you at least try
to put up a fight now?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] You don't have to tell
me twice.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:13.788 position:50% align:center
I'll put my damn life on the
line to win this if I have to!

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] Oh, my. What's got
you all fired up, hunty?

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.840 position:50% align:center
Something's changed,
and I can't afford to lose.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
Did you finally
recognize my importance?

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
Took you a while, but then
your brain's not the fastest.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Sand! How dare you
sucker punch me?!

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
Appearances be damned.
I'm in it to win it!

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] So, then, what do you
want to do for the next event?

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
Marksmanship.

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.522 position:50% align:center
[MEDOKI] Oh, is he choosing
what he's good at now?

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
[SHOKA] He doesn't
care about appearances,

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
but he's still
following the rules?

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
I'm a hunter, too, you know.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
I do know how to use a firearm.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
I have prepared some targets

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
and a gun that
can be used indoors.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
Who has that stuff
lying around?

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Ready, begin!

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
[SHOT]
Whoa! He fired like lightning

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
and hit
all the bullseyes!

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
[MEDOKI] He really is getting
serious!

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
[BATTER] He isn't called Ronaldo
the Peerless for nothing!

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
[SHOKA]
Oh, he's a little embarrassed.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[MEDOKI]
He is!

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
[MARIA] Yeah, compliments
make him uncomfortable.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
Shut up, bystanders!

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
What was up earlier, anyway?
You weren't trying to win?

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.350 position:50% align:center
We got money riding
on this! So, fight!

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way, I bought
your second book!

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too, man.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
Be quiet, idiots!
But thanks for your patronage!

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
Banter with the audience
is so fun during a match.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
It sure has gotten
more exciting!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
You just want attention!

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] I don't know
what changed his mind,

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
but I can't win now
without a solid plan.

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
If I want little Draluc,
I'd better get serious.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
[KOYUKI]
X.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] So, what will
you do for the next event?

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
A game I'm good at that Ronaldo
seems like he'd be bad at.

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.257 position:50% align:center
Ooh, Twister!

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I hate you!

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Here's a jumbo Twister
mat especially for adults.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Why do you have all this stuff?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Ah, this Twister
mat is a treasured item

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
upon which my wife and I have

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
made some white-hot,
spicy memories.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, the memories
are getting me all excited.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.189 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Super inappropriate!

00:17:03.273 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
Now circles of four
colors have appeared.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
What manner of contortionist
positions will Ronaldo take?

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] I like you much better
as a pile of sand, you moron!

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
[SENYA chuckles]
Save it for the mat, Ronaldo.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you asked for it, cupcake!

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
[SENYA] Oh, snap,
there's a fire in his eyes.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
In a man's life

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
there are some fights
he can't afford to lose!

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
I just don't want to wind up
inside the maiden, 'kay?

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
Oh, I'm not chaste.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Now, let us begin.
I will call out the colors.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Senya, right foot, green!

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
[SENYA grunts]

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Ronaldo, right foot, blue!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts]

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Senya, right hand, yellow!

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
Right!

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Ronaldo, left foot, yellow!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
Senya, left foot, blue!

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Ronaldo, right hand, blue!

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
Senya, left hand, blue!

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, left hand, green!

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
[SENYA, RONALDO grunts]

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It's already
heating up over there!

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Senya, left foot, green!

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, left hand, green!

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
Senya, right foot, blue!,
Ronaldo, right foot, blue!

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
Senya, left hand, green!

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, right hand, blue!

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
Senya, right hand, red!

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, left foot, yellow!

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Both players are holding out

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
longer than expected.
It's getting very awkward!

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
How much longer
is this gonna go on?

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
Something's awakening in me
and I feel uncomfortable.

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Both players, right hand, green!

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO, SENYA grunting]

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:31.319 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] Oh, dear, looks like
they both might be in trouble!

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
Not bad. Is this one a draw?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts]
You have got to be kidding me.

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
I don't know the word "draw"!

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
That's not in Ronaldo
the Great's dictionary!

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
And Ronaldo pulls it off!

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm way more
flexible than I thought!

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Lame catchphrase, though!

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
A stunning upset!

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
Our contestants are now tied
two and two! All right!

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO] That's what you
get when you challenge

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo the Great!

00:18:57.929 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
I didn't get my
back blown out. Yay!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
Ronaldo, you should
look that phrase up

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
when you have a chance.

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
Well, congrats!
The last match is coming up.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
Do your best, for my sake--

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Thanks, buddy!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
All right,
ready for the last bout?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
I think we should
choose an event

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
where we're equally matched.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.280 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC]
Disagree!

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
Please choose an event that
you're sure you can win!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
How 'bout...

[DRALUC, JOHN scream]

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
...Knock Down the Pole?

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:26.082 position:50% align:center
Can't little Draluc easily
help you cheat that way?

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess you've
got a good point there.

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[JOHN, DRALUC scream]

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] I, the guild master,
will be taking over commentary.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
Now, the final match
in the Battle for Draluc!

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
Senya vs. Ronaldo!

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
Vampire Knock Down the Pole
Without Honor or Humanity!

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
Fight!

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
I refuse to lose, Ronaldo.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Going first is Senya.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
With a quick attack,
he takes a large pile of Draluc.

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
Big yikes. It's like he's
tearing down a gravestone.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I won't let
you have this, Senya.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC groans]

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] Countering, Ronaldo
stretches out his arms

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
to take ashes
from the other side.

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
What a boring cheap shot.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Resorting
to cheap tricks?

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
How pathetic and futile.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
Feast your eyes on this.

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
I'm stronger than you!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Hey!

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Oh my, Senya's attacked!

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
Well, then? You can
surrender now, if you want.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
I'll do nothing of the sort.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO chuckles]

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
[SENYA shrieks]

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.067 position:50% align:center
Behold, Ronaldo
the Great's power!

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
[MASTER] An upset!
Ronaldo returned the favor!

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Don't forget;
this idiot and I are a team!

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
I know exactly how much
of him can be taken away!

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
If you want to risk toppling the
cross, then try and take more.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
I dare you.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:54.004 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
I can't take it! He's all yours!

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[MASTER]
Winner! Ronaldo!

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO chuckles] Justice
always wins out in the end.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
[SATESTU] The cross is
actually stuck into the table.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
[SHOT] So, when you were
thumping that around earlier.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO grunts]

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
[MEDOKI] You were
cheating the whole time?!

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
[MARIA]
You owe us!

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.236 position:50% align:center
Oh, just shut up!
I'm done with this charade!

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
I see. So that's
how it was, Ronaldo.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Huh? What? No, that's--

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
Love won the battle here today!

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.037 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO]
Uh, "love"?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
[SENYA]
You love little Draluc so much

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
that you were willing
to cheat for him!

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
Hold on just one minute.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
I never would've pegged you

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
as someone so full of
tenderness and passion!

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
It's been ages since
my heart fluttered so.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
I never imagined falling
for a non-vampire!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, Senya, I'm not--

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
Now, sweetie,
put this uniform on!

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
[RONALDO yelling]

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
Heh. This is where I say
"serves you right." 

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
Would you care for
something to drink?

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
A warm milk.
Put it on Ronaldo's tab.

00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] You, descendent
of my compatriot.

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
I will give you what you desire.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:10.413 position:50% align:center
This guy is a dhampir, right?

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:16.336 position:50% align:center line:10%
