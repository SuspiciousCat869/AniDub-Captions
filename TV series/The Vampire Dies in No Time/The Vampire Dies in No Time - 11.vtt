you shouldn't use him
as a ball, you scum!

[JOHN screams]

00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:09.305 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] One day, we received
word from the villa caretaker,

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
that John's parents
had been found.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:14.144 position:50% align:center
[JOHN]
Nuu!

00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:15.520 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] It turns out they were
attacked

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.313 position:50% align:center
by a giant vampiric mosquito

00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:20.483 position:50% align:center
and separated from
John when he was a baby.

[JOHN'S DAD, JOHN'S MOM squeak]

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:23.278 position:50% align:center
[JOHN]
Nuu!

00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:27.407 position:50% align:center
[JOHN'S DAD, JOHN'S MOM chatter]

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hmm.

00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:35.206 position:50% align:center
I will take the utmost
care of your son.

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:39.461 position:50% align:center
[DRALUC] A long time
has passed since then.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.379 position:50% align:center
But to this day,

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
we remain close with the
armadillos on that hill.
