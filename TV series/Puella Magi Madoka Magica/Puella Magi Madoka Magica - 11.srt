1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,460
Homura Akemi.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,200
You're a time traveler.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,750
You've traveled across several different timelines
and relived this month over and over,

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,360
always looking for a way to
change the outcome into the one you want.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,360
The truth about you does answer
one important question though.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,720
It solves the mystery of why Madoka Kaname has
so much incredible potential as a magical girl.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,630
At last I have a theory that explains it.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,900
A magical girl's potential is based on the
weight of the karmic destiny she bears.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,190
If she were a queen or Messiah, I could've understood,

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,710
but Madoka was given an ordinary life.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,130
So it was hard for me to understand why she
would be the focal point for so many destinies.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,950
But now, say, Homura,

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,620
could it be that Madoka's potential to
become the most powerful magical girl

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,440
is because you kept turning back time?

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,510
I thought so.

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,540
You are the cause of it,

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,960
or rather, a side effect of your
magic caused her to become that way.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,330
What do you mean?

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,720
There's only one reason you
kept repeating this timeline,

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
to save Madoka Kaname.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,170
By turning back time over and over,
and each time for the same reason,

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,890
you unknowingly caused these
multiple timelines to converge.

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,700
And they all converge around Madoka Kaname.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,080
The threads of fate of all the Madoka's in all
the different timelines were never linked before.

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,230
But if they converged upon a single point,
the Madoka in this timeline,

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,440
then that would explain why she has
the powerful magical potential she has.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,520
All of the karmic destinies,
from all the different timelines you affected,

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,760
eventually attached themselves to Madoka Kaname.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,050
After all, she's the reason this happened.

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,130
Excellent work, Homura.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,580
You've made Madoka the most powerful witch ever.

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,950
Tragic news, the body of an 8th grade
student from Mitakihara Public Middle School

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,540
has been identified as Sayaka Miki.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,540
She's been reported missing
since the 12th of this month.

35
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,080
Her body was discovered today
in a room of a downtown hotel,

36
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,980
and police are still investigating
whether her death was murder or suicide.

37
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,820
Up next, the weather.

38
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,170
Heavy rain tonight,
moderate wind coming from the northwest.

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,010
Come inside.

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,980
Hey, Madoka.

41
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,870
Huh?

42
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,250
Are you sure you don't know anything
about what happened to Sayaka?

43
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,750
Yeah.

44
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,150
I can't believe Sayaka and Kyoko are dead...

45
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,650
It shouldn't come as such a surprise.

46
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,930
It would've happened sooner or later.

47
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,420
But that doesn't make it okay!

48
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,610
It's your fault they're dead
and you act like it doesn't matter!

49
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,340
Do you feel any guilt to remorse
for the livestock you consume?

50
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,540
Have you ever thought about how those
animals become the food you eat?

51
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,520
No, stop it.

52
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,470
Your reaction isn't very rational.

53
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,880
If you don't like the things you saw just now,

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,980
I'm afraid you're missing the big picture.

55
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,440
Humans chose livestock to be food.

56
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,240
In exchange, they're fed,

57
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,380
allowed to reproduced and protected
from predators all their lives.

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,400
Cows, pigs, and chickens have a much
higher rate of survival in captivity,

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,200
more than they would in the wild.

60
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,750
So you see, the relationship is
mutually beneficial for both parties.

61
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,550
Is that how you see us?

62
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,130
On the contrary,

63
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,020
we treat humans with much more respect
than humans treat their livestock.

64
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,860
We acknowledge your species as a sentient
one and try to deal fairly with you.

65
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,360
Don't you believe me?

66
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,540
Would you like me to show you proof?

67
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,620
Human and the Incubators have shared history together.

68
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,700
We have intervened in your civilization's
development since prehistoric times.

69
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,330
Throughout the ages, countless girls
have made contracts with Incubators,

70
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,530
had their wishes granted and then succumbed to despair.

71
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,730
Stop it...

72
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,270
Beginning with a wish
and ending with a curse,

73
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,100
it's the cycle every magical
girl has repeated up till now.

74
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,730
Some have started revolutions that changed history,

75
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,340
while others elevated human society to new levels.

76
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,860
That's enough!

77
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,830
They trusted you...

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,610
All of them,
they trusted you and you betrayed them!

79
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,960
Oh no, we weren't the ones who betrayed them.

80
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,190
You could say their wishes did though.

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,330
Wishes are things that don't
exist in the current reality,

82
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,890
and anything that deviates from reality
is bound to create a distortion.

83
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,570
So why does it surprise anyone
that these things end in disaster?

84
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,740
It's the natural outcome after all.

85
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,980
If they think that's some kind of betrayal,

86
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,080
they shouldn't have made the wish in the first place.

87
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,230
Don't get me wrong,

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
I don't think they're foolish.

89
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,790
It was thanks to their sacrifices that
human society developed as far as it has.

90
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,490
It was the suffering of all the
magical girls throughout history

91
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,460
that laid the foundation of the life you have now.

92
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,270
If your civilization benefits from their sacrifice,

93
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,070
why should the lives of a few people
matter in the grand scheme of things?

94
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,250
You spent all that time with them,

95
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,430
didn't you ever feel anything?

96
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,190
Didn't you ever try to understand?

97
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,700
Couldn't you see how much pain they were in?

98
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,140
If we were capable of comprehending such things,

99
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,570
we wouldn't have come to your planet in the first place.

100
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,690
You see, in our society,

101
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,610
the phenomenon you call emotion
is considered a mental disorder.

102
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,180
We were surprised when we discovered the human species.

103
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,420
We never imagined there could be a world

104
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,630
where each individual had their own set of emotions,

105
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,250
yet still managed to co-exist with one another.

106
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,190
So then, if your kind had never
come to earth then none of this...

107
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,820
The truth is you humans would
most likely still be living naked,

108
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,950
in caves.

109
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,170
It's a shock.

110
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,940
Losing one of your own students like this is...painful.

111
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,600
Yeah.

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,010
We still don't even know what really happened to her.

113
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,230
They told us one of the 9th graders was missing too.

114
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,650
All of the teachers are concerned.

115
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,640
And no one knows anything about it?

116
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,280
I heard that, Sayaka was having some
problems with a friend over a boy,

117
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,560
her friend's taking this pretty hard too.

118
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,790
This is something that usually
passes after a little heartache,

119
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,160
but instead it turned out this way.

120
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,250
The police say it was an accident,

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,380
that the stress of running away from home got to her.

122
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,360
Yeah, but...they don't know for sure.

123
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,870
How's Madoka taking it?

124
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,140
I don't know.

125
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,260
My gut tells me she knows more
about it than she's saying.

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,340
She's not telling me but she's not lying.

127
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,110
It's the first time I can't see
what's going on in that head of hers.

128
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,520
Isn't that pathetic?
I mean she's my own daughter...

129
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,550
You've never had that problem before?

130
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,660
Well, she hasn't been acting like herself lately.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
I can tell there's something heavy on her mind,

132
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,560
and usually she'd come talk to me about it.

133
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,070
She knows she can come to me with
whatever problem she's got...

134
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,880
Yeah, but it's hard with kids that age...

135
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,810
I mean one day you turn around
and they're all grown up.

136
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,220
That's gotta be quite a shock for a parent.

137
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah, I guess you're right.

138
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,450
You've got no choice but to trust them.

139
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,980
All Madoka needs right now is a little
time to get a handle on her feelings.

140
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,350
Just be patient.
She'll come around.

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,730
But it's so hard 'cause I feel so helpless...

142
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,140
Patience was never something
you were good at, was it, Junko?

143
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,600
Mind if I come in?

144
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,120
That's...Walpurgisnacht, isn't it?

145
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,950
Kyoko told me about it.

146
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,870
She said you were teaming up.

147
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,020
She also said it was so strong one
magical girl couldn't beat it by herself.

148
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,190
Is this where you're getting ready?

149
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,240
The city is in danger, isn't it?

150
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,870
This witch is different from the others.

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,290
It's so powerful,
it doesn't need to hide in a labyrinth.

152
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,840
And once it appears,
thousands of people are going to die,

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,290
just like that.

154
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,840
Since ordinary humans can't see it,

155
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,170
they'd think the destruction was caused by
an earthquake, tornado, or other disaster.

156
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,920
Okay, then it has to be destroyed no matter what.

157
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,270
Now that Kyoko's dead, you're alone...

158
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,000
You are the only magical girl left and
you're going to need someone's help to beat it.

159
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,970
What if I...

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Maybe Kyoko couldn't do it.

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,880
But I can certainly defeat Walpurgisnacht on my own.

162
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,990
To tell you the truth, I never really needed her help.

163
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,890
I just agreed so that she wouldn't feel bad.

164
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,330
Is that true?

165
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,440
I want to believe you.

166
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,500
I do.

167
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,290
I don't know why, but...

168
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,550
I guess I...

169
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,580
I guess I don't wanna think you'd lie to me.

170
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,060
But I don't think you're being honest with me right now,

171
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,620
and I don't think you're gonna be alright on your own.

172
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,780
How can I be honest with you?

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,740
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

174
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,660
Homura...?

175
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,540
The thing is...

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,340
I'm...

177
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,080
you and me...

178
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,070
We're not even from the same time!

179
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,230
Ah..

180
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,270
The truth is,

181
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm from the future.

182
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,590
I've met you over and over.

183
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,570
And every time-

184
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,740
and every time-

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
I've had to watch you die.

186
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,780
What could I have to do to save you?

187
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,560
What do I have to do to change your fate?

188
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,480
I've kept doing this month over again,
searching for the answer.

189
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,220
What'd you...

190
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,400
huh...

191
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,250
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,210
I'm not making any sense.

193
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,910
I'm scaring you, aren't I?

194
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean you barely know me.

195
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,250
I just started going to your school
so it's not like you really know me.

196
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,790
But I know you.

197
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,160
I know you so well and you're my...

198
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,770
Everything's messed up.

199
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,570
The more I redo this time,
the further apart we get.

200
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,420
My feelings, my words,
nothing gets through to you.

201
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,810
I'm out of options.

202
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,100
I don't know what to do anymore.

203
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,620
Homura...

204
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,710
I will save you.

205
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,850
That's the one thing I wished for.

206
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,690
That's how it started.

207
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,030
And now, it's the only thing I have left to guide me.

208
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,810
And it's okay if you don't
understand anything I'm saying.

209
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,060
But, please...

210
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,850
Please... let me protect you.

211
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,160
The updraft's speeding faster now,
check out those clouds.

212
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,150
A supercell is forming,
no doubt about it!

213
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,070
Issue the evacuation order!

214
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,410
Due to extreme weather conditions,

215
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,570
an evacuation order has been issued for 7 am.

216
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,140
Attention. This is a public service
announcement for Mitagihara city.

217
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,930
Due to extreme weather conditions,

218
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,360
an evacuation order has been issued for 7 am.

219
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,480
It's here.

220
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,020
Daddy, we go camping tonight?

221
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,570
We're going camping with everyone here!

222
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,530
Homura...

223
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,210
Okay then.

224
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,110
This time I'll finish you.

225
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,310
What's wrong, Madoka?

226
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,290
Going to the bathroom.

227
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,830
Do you think Homura's gonna
be able to beat it all by herself?

228
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,900
If I told you no, what difference would it make?

229
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,180
You wouldn't believe me.

230
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,140
Explanations are pointless now.

231
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,770
If you wanna know,
you should go have a look.

232
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,060
See for yourself how Homura Akemi
is doing against Walpurgisnacht.

233
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,060
Do you know why she's being so stubborn about it?

234
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,030
Because she hasn't given up hope.
That's why.

235
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,690
If things don't work out,

236
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,990
she'll just negate this timeline
and start it all over again.

237
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,280
She'll go on and on,
and keep right on fighting,

238
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,820
and continue this meaningless chain of events.

239
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,600
At this point, it's not possible
for her to stop or give up.

240
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,390
That's not an option any more.

241
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,260
You see,

242
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,300
the moment she acknowledges that
everything she's done is pointless,

243
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,370
and your fate's impossible to change,

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,690
Homura Akemi will fall into despair
and turn into a Grief Seed.

245
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,420
She knows it to be true.

246
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,230
And that's why she has no choice.

247
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,990
She has to keep fighting,
regardless of whether she can win or not.

248
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,400
So you're saying as long as she thinks there's hope,

249
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,480
she's doomed?

250
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,570
That's right.

251
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,630
Just like it was for all the past magical girls.

252
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,740
Remember, Madoka.

253
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,070
You've seen it.

254
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,170
But...

255
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,570
But...!

256
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,840
But...!!

257
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,490
Where do you think you're going, huh?

258
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,810
Mom?

259
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
I have to go outside,

260
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,980
to save a friend.

261
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,140
The fire department can take care of it.

262
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,770
You need to stay here.

263
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,450
But I'm the only one who can do this!

264
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,140
You can't just go off and do what you want!

265
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,400
Don't you know how much we worried about you?!

266
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,910
You just went out there without saying anything to...

267
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,790
I do, Mom. Really.

268
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,620
I know how you and dad would feel
because I love you too.

269
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,480
I understand how much you and dad care about me,

270
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,660
and I know I have to be careful.

271
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,840
I do.

272
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,850
But this is different.

273
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,430
I have to protect you because
of how much I care about you.

274
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,720
And I can do it.

275
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,060
But the only way I can help
is if you let me go right now!

276
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,270
Sure you don't want to tell me what this is about?

277
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,400
Okay, then I'm coming with you.

278
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,960
Mom, it's better if you stay with dad and Tatsuya.

279
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,010
Someone has to make sure they're safe too.

280
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,320
You told me once,

281
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,730
that you did a good job of raising me
and you're right, you did.

282
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,820
I don't tell lies,
and I don't do bad things.

283
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,400
I need you to trust me now.

284
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,420
I need you to trust that I'm doing the right thing.

285
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,380
And you're sure you're not making a mistake?

286
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,550
No one's lying to you or trying to trick you?

287
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,510
I'm sure.

288
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,750
Thank you, mom. I love you.

289
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,380
That's enough.

290
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,060
You've done more than enough, Homura.

291
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,780
Madoka...

292
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,510
Madoka...

293
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,180
don't do it!

294
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,030
Homura, I am sorry.

295
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,110
If someone ever tells me it's a mistake to have hope,

296
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,350
well then, I just tell them they're wrong,

297
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,430
and I keep telling them 'til they believe,

298
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,750
no matter how many times it takes.

299
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,540
My very best friend.

300
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,210
I can handle it by myself.

301
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,330
You've got it, little guy.

302
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,080
Camping! Yay!

303
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,540
I know.

304
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,930
<i>I have to stop it.</i>

305
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,150
<i>If it gets any closer to the evacuation center...</i>

306
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,170
<i>Whatever happens, I can't let it get any further!</i>

307
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,770
<i>Oh no...!</i>

308
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,040
<i>Why...?</i>

309
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,080
<i>Why...?!</i>

310
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,140
<i>No matter how many times I've tried,</i>

311
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>why can't I beat it?</i>

312
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,470
<i>If I go back again...</i>

313
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,140
<i>I'll only make Madoka's destiny worse...</i>

314
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,480
<i>Everything I've done...</i>

315
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,700
<i>Everything I've tried to do...</i>
