1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,830
I'm Mami Tomoe.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,520
I'm a 9th grader at Mitakihara Middle School.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,430
And...

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,850
once I made a contract with
Kyubey, I became a magical girl.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,300
I had another weird dream.

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,150
Huh?

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,500
Good morning, Madoka.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,910
Ah!

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,350
Hehehe...

10
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,690
Madoka.

11
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,560
You got in pretty late last night, didn't you?

12
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,710
I got invited over to a friend's house.

13
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,730
I don't wanna start cracking down
on you with curfews and stuff.

14
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,950
Next time, let us know where you are before dinner.

15
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,020
Mm-hmm.

16
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,100
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,930
Wow.

18
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,230
Cool apartment.

19
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,400
I live alone, so make yourselves at home.

20
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,270
Although as far as refreshments go, I don't have much.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Wow, Mami.

22
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,310
This is so delicious!

23
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,850
Mm, super delicious!

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,690
Thank you.

25
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,680
Since Kyubey chose the two of you, that means
you're both involved in this, like it or not.

26
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,160
I though it might be good if we had a talk.

27
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,330
Mm-hm.

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,160
Go ahead, ask us anything you want.

29
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,960
Sayaka, you've got it wrong.

30
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,830
Ah, pretty!

31
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,680
It's called a Soul Gem.

32
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,390
When Kyubey chooses a girl,
it's created when she makes a contract with him.

33
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,140
It's the source of our magic,
and it also proves that we're magical girls.

34
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,380
What's this contract?

35
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,080
I will grant each of you one wish, any wish you desire.

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,110
Huh?

37
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:56,980
For reals?

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,290
Anything at all?

39
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,430
Anything at all.

40
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,290
I can grant the most impossible of miracles!

41
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,740
Oh, we could wish for treasure.

42
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,310
Or eternal youth?

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,610
Or 108-course banquet?

44
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,950
Maybe that last one's a bit much.

45
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,250
In exchange for that wish, your Soul Gem is created.

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,480
But if you have a Soul Gem,
it would be your duty to fight witches.

47
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,430
Witches?

48
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,610
Um, hey Mom?

49
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,620
Hm?

50
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,970
This might sound silly but,

51
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,500
um, if someone could grand any
wish you wanted using magic,

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,620
what would you wish for?

53
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,770
I'd wish for those two trustees to
get kicked right out of the company.

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,190
Hehehe...

55
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,530
Come to think of it,

56
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,230
There's the CEO.

57
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,990
He's too old to keep up the pace like he used
to, so maybe I'd wish for him to retire.

58
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,600
Thing is, he hasn't named a successor yet.

59
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,550
What would you do if you became the new CEO?

60
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,210
Ah, how would I go about it?

61
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,250
If I can get enough support from the Sales Department,
the Planning Committee and General Affairs,

62
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,610
that leaves old Baldy in the Accounting.

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
Interesting...

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,990
Mom, your eyes are scary.

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,380
What is a witch anyway?

66
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,430
Are they different from magical girls?

67
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,780
If magical girls are said to be born from wishes,
then witches are creatures born from curses.

68
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,470
Magical girls bring hope to the
world, witches bring despair.

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,970
And since they're invisible to humans,
they are that much more insidious.

70
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,030
Anxiety and mistrust, rage and hatred...

71
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,400
They sow the seeds of disaster all over the world.

72
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,110
Suicides that can't be explained and murders without motive,
a witch's curse is most likely the cause of such things.

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,080
It festers within a person,
and grows and grows until it consumes them.

74
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,730
If there're things like that out there,
how come people don't know about them?

75
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,890
A witch is careful about not letting humans see them.

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,550
They hide deep within the labyrinths they create.

77
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,830
You know that maze-like place you were in today?

78
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,810
That was a labyrinth.

79
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,380
Actually, you were both in a lot of danger.

80
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,070
If a human ever wanders into one,
they seldom make it out alive.

81
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,350
Is that what you do?

82
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,530
You fight these horrible creatures, Mami?

83
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Yes, I risk my life.

84
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,120
That's why the two of you should
think carefully before you decide.

85
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,750
Kyubey chose you and offered a rare chance,
it's true you'll grant whatever wish you can think of.

86
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,050
But remember death is part of that deal.

87
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,220
Huh?

88
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,320
Oh, now I'm stressed.

89
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,350
I know it's a tough decision.

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,100
But maybe if you went on a few witch hunts with
me, it'll help you decide.

91
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,840
Huh?!

92
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,100
See for yourselves what it's like to fight a witch.

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,280
Think about the offer a little longer.

94
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,030
Think long and hard.

95
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,340
Ask yourselves, is this something you want so badly
that is worth putting your life in danger for?

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,780
Good morning!

97
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
Oh, good morning!

98
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,650
Hey! Urgh...

99
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,070
Good morning, Sayaka!

100
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,420
Ugh.

101
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,780
You look ill.

102
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,830
Is something the matter?

103
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,740
Look like we're the only ones who can see him, huh?

104
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,820
I guess so.

105
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,680
What are you...?

106
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,360
Nah... it's nothing.

107
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,660
Well, let's go!

108
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,370
Huh?

109
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,450
Excuse me.

110
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,250
What's going on between you?

111
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,590
Why do you keep staring at each other?

112
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,830
Huh? Oh... Uh...

113
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,250
It's...just...

114
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,980
I can't believe it!

115
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,110
Just by looking at each other,
you know what the other's thinking?

116
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,390
Oh, for two people to become
that intimate after one night?

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,840
What did you do after I left yesterday?

118
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,190
I can't believe she's going there.

119
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,830
Well, actually...

120
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,810
lots of things happened but...

121
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,350
That's enough! You can't be serious!

122
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,030
You're both girls!

123
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,540
Girls can't love girls!

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,010
Girls can't love girls!

125
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,430
Girls can't love girls...

126
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,410
Hey, wait!

127
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,430
You forgot your bag!

128
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,420
Huh, what's wrong with her?

129
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,870
Hitomi's acting just like you today.

130
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,050
What the heck is that supposed to mean?!

131
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,580
Are you sure this is okay?

132
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,600
I mean tagging along to school and everything.

133
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,250
That transfer student, you know the new girl in class?

134
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,970
Is she the same as you? A magical girl?

135
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,300
She is.

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,540
There's no doubt.

137
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,060
And she is a very powerful one, too.

138
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,170
Then she is a good guy.

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,690
I mean if she fights withes and stuff like you, right?

140
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,770
But then, why would she do something like attack Madoka?

141
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,390
It was me she was after.

142
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,290
I think she was trying to keep me from
making a contract with a new magical girl.

143
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,660
Yeah, but...

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,710
If we're fighting the same enemy,
wouldn't it be better if there were more of us?

145
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,440
No, not necessarily.

146
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,800
It's more common for magical girls to fight each other.

147
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,120
Really?

148
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
But how come?

149
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,580
When you defeat a witch, you acquire certain rewards.

150
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,670
That's why, depending on the situation, magical
girls will fight, and the winner gets the reward.

151
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,180
Okay, hold up, so the reason the weird transfer
student was staring at Madoka yesterday,

152
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,250
was 'cause she knew Kyubey was trying to contact her?

153
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,760
Most likely, yes.

154
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,690
Anyway, the form of the verb we're talking
about is called the 'active voice.'

155
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,110
For the ones taking notes, that's when the subject
to the sentence is doing something to the object.

156
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,820
Now, the flip side of that is the 'passive voice.'

157
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,720
That's when the subject to the sentence is
having something done to it by the object.

158
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,700
Take a sentence, "he likes me," the subject is 'he.'

159
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,470
And since he is the one doing
something, the sentence is in the act...

160
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,030
Here.

161
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,600
Hey, Madoka.

162
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,820
You have any luck trying to figure
out what you're gonna wish for?

163
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,470
Uh-uh.

164
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,680
How about you?

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,310
I don't have a clue.

166
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm totally stumped.

167
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,060
I've thought about it so much
my brain is starting to hurt.

168
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,950
I mean, there's a bunch of
stuff I wanna have or do, but...

169
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,760
Maybe it's the risk-your-life
part, maybe that's holding me back.

170
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,310
Yeah well, nothing I want's worth that
much, that's for sure.

171
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,090
Mm...

172
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,730
That's so odd.

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,060
Most girls accept my offer right away.

174
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,340
Then...

175
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,590
I guess we don't know any better, do we?

176
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,720
Really?

177
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,980
Do you think so?

178
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,570
Yep. We're blissfully ignorant.

179
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,700
Just think about it for a sec.

180
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,960
Have you ever wanted something so
bad, you'd trade your life for it?

181
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,740
There's tons of people out there,
with a lot less than we have,

182
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,510
who'd jump at a chance like this.

183
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,590
You see, we can't figure out what to wish for,

184
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,630
'cause we don't know what it's
like to want something that bad.

185
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,820
We're blissfully ignorant to any kind of suffering.

186
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,720
Why us?

187
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,880
Why did we get this chance?

188
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,690
Uh...

189
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,620
It's not fair, is it?

190
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,000
I get to have a wish, but you know,

191
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,170
there's other people out there,
who deserved it a lot more.

192
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,550
Sayaka...

193
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,880
Back for more, huh?

194
00:12:59,330 --> 00:12:59,950
No.

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,640
I haven't come to fight.

196
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,520
I wanted to kill it,
before it made contact with Madoka Kaname.

197
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,790
It's too late for that now.

198
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,730
Well, now what?

199
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,370
Are you going to become a magical girl?

200
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm, uh...

201
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,350
Yeah, right.

202
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,040
Like it's any of your business.

203
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,500
I warned you, remember?

204
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,680
Yes.

205
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,980
Very well then.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,000
I hope my warnings aren't in vain.

207
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,350
Good bye.

208
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,610
H-Homura.

209
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,480
Um, wait!

210
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,270
I'd like to know what you wished
for when you became a magical girl.

211
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,140
Hitomi!

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,230
Oh, something private?

213
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,400
Well, uh...

214
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,950
I'm so jealous!

215
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,490
I guess it's true what they say how two's
company, and three's a crowd!

216
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,380
You got it all wrong, again...

217
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,220
Miss Akemi,

218
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,200
We're going for coffee after school, wanna come with us?

219
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,510
Not today.

220
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,300
I've got some stuff to do.

221
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,590
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,110
Aww.

223
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,910
Well, time to start Lesson One
of the Magical Girl Experience.

224
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,910
That's what I'd like to call it, anyway.

225
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,800
I hope you're ready.

226
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,010
I don't know if it'll make a difference but...

227
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,750
I brought this!

228
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,690
I mean it's better than not having anything, right?

229
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,620
Well, let's say I'm glad you're
going into it with that spirit.

230
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,600
How about you?

231
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,560
What'd you bring?

232
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,470
Huh?

233
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,490
Nothing...

234
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,600
Just this.

235
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,560
Ooh...

236
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,160
I-I sort of thought...it'd be good to
have some costume ideas just in case.

237
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,580
Ha ha ha...!

238
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,430
Huh?

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,770
Well, you certainly have the right spirit.

240
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,030
That's so awesome!

241
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,530
I can't top that!

242
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,200
Ha ha ha!

243
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,840
It senses the magic residuals
of the witch we saw yesterday.

244
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,060
When we hunt, we have to scout the city by foot.

245
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,180
Once your Soul Gem picks up a trail,
follow it until you find the witch.

246
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,470
Really?

247
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,540
That's it, huh?

248
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,000
What now?

249
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,810
Your Gem's not going any brighter.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,940
That's because it's been a whole
day since the witch escaped.

251
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,070
The trail has almost faded away.

252
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,110
Then, if you'd gone after it right away last night...

253
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,260
I might have been able to finish it off.

254
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,310
But I would've had to leave the two of
you alone and I didn't wanna risk it.

255
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,820
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,950
It's fine.

257
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,980
Yep! You really are an ally of justice, Mami.

258
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,770
Not like that psycho.

259
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,260
What's her deal anyway?!

260
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,600
She really pisses me off!

261
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,700
Hey, Mami.

262
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,420
When you're tracking a witch,
do you look any place special for them?

263
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,050
Sometimes you'll find traces of
witches' auras about fatal car crashes.

264
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,300
So I check streets with heavy traffic.

265
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,860
Then the Red Light District,
where fights usually break out.

266
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,160
Also I check places people go to commit suicide.

267
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,190
Then I check the hospitals,
the worst place for a witch to hide.

268
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:05,250
It's unbearable to see them draining the life force
from a helpless person, who's already weak from illness.

269
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,310
It's picked up some powerful magic.

270
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,730
It's close.

271
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,040
There's no mistake.

272
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,200
It's here!

273
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,910
Look up there!

274
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,490
Ha!

275
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,610
A Witch's Kiss.

276
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,090
I knew it.

277
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,980
Is she dead?

278
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,020
She's okay.

279
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,490
She just fainted, is all.

280
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,400
Let's go!

281
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,420
You won't escape this time.

282
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,390
Whoa, look at that!

283
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,420
Oh, wow!

284
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,540
It's not much, I know.

285
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,270
But it'll help you fight off
anything that tries to attack.

286
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,060
Stay close to me once we're inside, okay?

287
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,500
'Kay!

288
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,710
Get back!

289
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,960
Get back!

290
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,010
How about it?

291
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
Are the two of you scared?

292
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,390
Yeah, as if.

293
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,090
Keep going.

294
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,200
We're almost at the center of the labyrinth.

295
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:38,890
Look.

296
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,130
That is a witch.

297
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,610
Eww... Gross!

298
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,750
It's awful!

299
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,740
Are you really gonna fight it?

300
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,960
I'll be fine.

301
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,750
I could never lose.

302
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,810
Stay back! Don't move!

303
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,820
Oh, no!

304
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,310
Mami!

305
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,670
I'm okay.

306
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,810
I can't let myself look uncool in
front of my magical girls trainees!

307
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,450
Let's wrap this up.

308
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,400
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

309
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,520
So, you won?

310
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,450
Awesome!

311
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,220
This is a Grief Seed.

312
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,670
It's a witch's egg.

313
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,740
An egg?

314
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,570
Witches will carry them sometimes.

315
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,020
If you're lucky you'll find one after a battle.

316
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,120
Don't worry. When they're like
that, they're perfectly safe.

317
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,960
In fact, they're valuable because of what they do.

318
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,730
The color of my Soul Gem looks staler
than it did last night, doesn't it?

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,780
It does.

320
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,340
But, if I do this with the Grief Seed...

321
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,970
See?

322
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,570
Wow! It cleared right up.

323
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,070
Uh-huh.

324
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,090
And the magic I used during the
fight has been restored, too.

325
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,360
Remember those rewards that I talked about?

326
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,490
This is it.

327
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,430
It should be good for at least one more use.

328
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,270
Take it!

329
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,570
I'm giving it to you.

330
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,870
Miss Homura Akemi.

331
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,260
Her again.

332
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,570
Hmm...

333
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,050
Maybe you're not the sharing-with-others type.

334
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,450
It was your kill.

335
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,030
So, keep the reward for yourself.

336
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,460
Fine.

337
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,970
If that's what you want, so be it.

338
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,280
Seriously!

339
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,130
She bugs the hell out of me!

340
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,250
But why can't we be friends with her?

341
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,140
She has to want to be friends, right?

342
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,590
What the...

343
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,440
Huh?

344
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,840
Where am I?

345
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,250
Ah! I... Oh, god!

346
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,150
No...

347
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:12,900
I just...

348
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,880
I just...

349
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,340
I jumped but I don't know why...

350
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,150
It's okay.

351
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,450
Don't worry. You're safe now.

352
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,930
See?

353
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,340
You were just having a nightmare, is all.

354
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,590
Well, I guess that's it.

355
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,030
Case closed, huh?

356
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,200
Mm-hm.

357
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,620
Hey, sorry but we sort of have a
couple of errands to run, so...

358
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,420
I just pretend to be cool.

359
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,530
When I'm scared or hurt, there is no one I can talk to.

360
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,980
All I can do is cry on my own.

361
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,430
It's not fun...

362
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,440
...being a magical girl.

363
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,310
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

364
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,840
<i>People really can't see him.</i>

365
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,390
<i>We can communicate like this,
just by thinking to each other.</i>

366
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,440
<i>You mean we already have magical powers?</i>

367
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,350
<i>For reals?</i>

368
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,760
<i>No, not yet.</i>

369
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,460
<i>I'm letting you communicate your thoughts through me.</i>

370
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>But it's kind of a handy trick, don't you think?</i>

371
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,270
<i>It feels sort of...weird.</i>

372
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,680
<i>Why not?</i>

373
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,510
<i>That psycho chick who was trying to kill
you yesterday just transferred to our class.</i>

374
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,020
<i>You're sort of risking your life being here.</i>

375
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,150
<i>Actually, I think the school is the safest place for me.</i>

376
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,520
<i>Besides, Mami's here.</i>

377
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,090
<i>Mami's a 9th grader,
she's way over on the other side of school.</i>

378
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,410
<i>Don't worry, I can hear all of you perfectly.</i>

379
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>She's not that far, so my telepathy can still reach her.</i>

380
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,220
<i>Oh, uh, um, good morning!</i>

381
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,680
<i>I promise I'll keep a close watch over you.</i>

382
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,830
<i>Besides, she doesn't seem like the
type who would attack you in public.</i>

383
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,180
<i>If you say so...</i>

384
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,430
<i>Ugh... Speak of the devil.</i>

385
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,580
<i>Don't worry, Madoka.</i>

386
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,360
<i>If she steps out of line and tries anything
funny, I'll punch her lights out.</i>

387
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,520
<i>Besides, Mami's got our back.</i>

388
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,460
<i>That's right.</i>

389
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,590
<i>I'm here, so everything will be fine.</i>

390
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,170
<i>Regardless of Sayaka and her punches.</i>

391
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,260
<i>What do you mean 'regardless?'</i>

392
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,270
<i>It's okay.</i>

393
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,640
<i>I wonder...</i>

394
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,050
<i>Is she really a bad person...?</i>

395
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,860
<i>I'm scared...</i>

396
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,070
<i>But...</i>

397
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,110
<i>It's still really hard for me
to figure out what I'd wish for.</i>

398
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,270
<i>It's not something I can put my finger on that easily.</i>

399
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,550
<i>But Mami tries so hard to save people.</i>

400
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,300
<i>She looks so amazing doing it, too.</i>

401
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,890
<i>If someone like me could do that,
go around helping people who're in trouble?</i>

402
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,890
<i>Well, I think that would be...</i>

403
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,980
<i>...truly wonderful.</i>
