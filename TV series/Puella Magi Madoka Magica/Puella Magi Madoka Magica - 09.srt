1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,210
Ah!

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,330
For all the happiness you wish for someone,
someone else gets cursed with equal misery.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,000
That's how it works for magical girls,
and that's how it is for me.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,030
I was stupid...

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,180
so stupid...

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,420
Ah, Sayaka!

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,390
What the hell...?

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,970
What are you?

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,220
What have you done to Sayaka?!

10
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,510
No, get back.

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,860
Take my hand.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,300
What are you gonna do?

13
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,600
Just do it!

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,740
It's stopped!

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,610
Do not let go of my hand.

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,550
You'll be frozen in time if you do.

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,600
Hurry!

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,160
What the hell is going on?

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,640
Where did that witch come from?

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,580
That witch used to be Sayaka Miki.

21
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,630
You saw, it happened right in front of you.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,090
We're just gonna run away?

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,230
We could stop her now and kill it.

24
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,350
Just drop that useless baggage and we'll go back.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,800
Shall we?

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,810
Teal, like hell!

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,650
You can't fight and carry her.

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,040
You'll get us both killed.

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,490
We're leaving for now.

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,270
Huh?

31
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Sayaka!

32
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,380
Sayaka! What happened?

33
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,180
Where's her Soul Gem?

34
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,240
Wh-What happened to her?

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,510
Her Soul Gem disappeared.

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,640
It transformed into a Grief Seed.

37
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,960
A witch hatched and it vanished.

38
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,210
No...

39
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,530
It can't be...

40
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,910
It is.

41
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,900
That's the final secret of the Soul Gems.

42
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,810
When our gems get too tainted and turn completely black,

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,670
we transform into Grief Seeds.

44
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,220
Then we are reborn as witches.

45
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,540
See?

46
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,730
This is the destiny which no magical girl can escape.

47
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,160
It's not true.

48
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,150
It can't be true.

49
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,270
Right?

50
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,520
But...

51
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
how...?

52
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,320
She...

53
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,540
She only wanted to protect people from witches.

54
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,980
She wanted to be a hero.

55
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,420
That's why she became a magical girl.

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,100
Why?

57
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,320
Her curse became as powerful as her wish.

58
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,110
It was only a matter of time, really.

59
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,450
And from now on, for each person she saved,

60
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,420
she'll curse another in return.

61
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
Why you...!

62
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,030
What the hell is your problem?

63
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,130
You're trying to impress us with
your big brain or something?

64
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,490
How can you stand there talking crap like that?!

65
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,090
She was Sayaka's...

66
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,480
She was her best friend!

67
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,480
You understand now, don't you?

68
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,200
The thing you wanted so much to be.

69
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,810
This is it.

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,430
Oh, and the body you brought along,
it's your responsibility now.

71
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,790
You better be careful getting rid of it
though, or it'll cause problems later.

72
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,740
And do you dare call yourself human?!

73
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,340
No, of course I don't.

74
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,050
Neither should you.

75
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,010
Ugh.

76
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,890
May I come in?

77
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,300
I'd like to talk with you.

78
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,720
You're still alive...

79
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,600
That stuff Homura was saying, is it true?

80
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,160
It's true enough that I can't deny it.

81
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,580
Then...

82
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,350
you turned us into magical girls,
so...we become witches?

83
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,130
Please don't misunderstand our intentions.

84
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,420
We don't do what we do because we
harbor ill will towards the human race.

85
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,090
Everything we've done is to
prolong the life of the universe.

86
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,260
Madoka, do you know what the word "entropy" means?

87
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
Here's an example.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,350
The energy a bonfire gives off is not equal to
the energy it took to grow the wood that fuels it.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,510
When energy changes form, some of it gets lost.

90
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,680
We found that the amount of energy
in the universe is decreasing.

91
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,340
So we began searching for a form of energy that
wasn't limited by the laws of thermodynamics.

92
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,590
And then we found the energy,
created by magical girls.

93
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,140
What are you...

94
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,840
really?

95
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,900
My civilization created a technology that

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,170
converts the emotions of a
sentient lifeform's into energy.

97
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,540
Unfortunately, our species doesn't possess
the capacity to experience emotions.

98
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,480
So we searched the universe
and studied all the various species,

99
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,130
until we finally found you humans.

100
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,170
With the size of your population
and the rate at which you reproduce,

101
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,240
we saw how the amount of emotional
energy produced by a single human

102
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,890
is greater than the amount used
between its birth and growth.

103
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,310
The human soul is the energy source we need
that counteracts the effects of entropy.

104
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,660
The most effective energy came from females
in their second stage of development,

105
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,420
when they have the most intense
fluctuations of hope and despair.

106
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,520
At the precise moment when your Soul
Gems flare out and become Grief Seeds,

107
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,140
an enormous amount of energy is created.

108
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,260
As an incubator, my job is to
gather up that expended energy.

109
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,790
That's all we are to you...

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,060
disposable?

111
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
You want us to die for you.

112
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,550
And you don't even care.

113
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,030
Do you know how many civilizations
there are in the universe?

114
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,370
Can you even comprehend the amount
of energy they use each second?

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,680
There will come a day when you humans
figure out how to leave this planet,

116
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,820
and you'll join the rest of the universe.

117
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,130
When you do, you wouldn't wanna find the
universe empty and desolate, would you?

118
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,230
If you consider the long term, this is a good deal,

119
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,950
for you and everyone else.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,170
How can you say that?

121
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,020
Do you think it's okay for Mami to die...

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,070
and Sayaka to suffer...

123
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,730
some crazy reason like that?

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,580
That's not right!

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,330
That's so mean!

126
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,190
But we always ask for and make sure to receive
your consent before making the contract.

127
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,430
That alone should show you that
we don't mean you any ill will?

128
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,700
But you do it by tricking us into it!

129
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,900
We don't understand this concept of "tricking you."

130
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,350
Why is it that when humans regret a decision they made

131
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,360
based on their own misunderstanding,
they feel resentment toward the other party?

132
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,730
I can't do this.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,780
You're not saying anything.

134
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,810
I don't understand you at all.

135
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,270
We've had such a hard time understanding
you humans and your values system too.

136
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,770
With a current population of 6.9 billion
which increases by a rate of 10 every 4 seconds,

137
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,480
it's a mystery why you would care so
much about the loss of a tiny handful?

138
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,550
If that's how you think about us, then I guess...

139
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,800
you really are our enemy.

140
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,410
I came here try to explain ourselves to you.

141
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,960
I was genuinely hoping you'd understand how much
good humanity sacrifices have done for this universe.

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,030
I guess I wasn't successful.

143
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,640
Of course, you weren't!

144
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,430
I still believe that one day,
you'll become the greatest of all magical girls,

145
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,910
and then the worst of all witches.

146
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,670
And when that happens, we'll have access
to an unbelievable amount of energy.

147
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,150
So if you ever feel like dying for
the sake of the universe, call me.

148
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,510
I'll be waiting.

149
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,020
What are you hoping for by using all
that energy just to keep her body fresh?

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,540
Is there a way to get her Soul Gem back, the way it was?

151
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,280
If there is a way, I'm not aware of it.

152
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,380
That's funny.

153
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,740
It looks like even you don't
have all the answers, do ya?

154
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,000
The existence of magical girls defies logic.

155
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,180
So I wouldn't be surprised if you turned out

156
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,910
you were capable of doing all kinds of amazing things.

157
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,620
Then it is possible.

158
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,610
It hasn't happened before so I'm not
really sure how you'd go about it.

159
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,530
Unfortunately, I can't advise you on the matter.

160
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,450
Hell like I needed.

161
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,870
Who'd ask...

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,640
for your...

163
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,760
advice...

164
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,820
now?!

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,640
Madoka, you're looking a bit under the weather today.

166
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,250
Are you okay?

167
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,690
Mm-hm.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,710
I just didn't get enough sleep.

169
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,550
That's too bad.

170
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,870
And it looks Sayaka's staying home again.

171
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,440
Maybe we should go and see how she's doing.

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
Although, I don't think she'll be too happy to see me.

173
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,260
Things've been...

174
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,650
a little bit awkward between us lately.

175
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Madoka?

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,120
Mm...

177
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,620
Hitomi, sorry.

178
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,930
I can't go to school.

179
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,560
I-I better go back home!

180
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,130
But, Madoka, wait!

181
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
Um, you wanted to talk?

182
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,750
Uh-huh.

183
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,780
You wanna save Sayaka Miki?

184
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,070
Ah? Do you think there a way, really?

185
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,600
If there wasn't, you just gonna leave her like that?

186
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,990
Um...

187
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,270
That came out the wrong way, my bad.

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,860
I know this sounds kinda crazy but...

189
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,650
the thing is...

190
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,720
we don't know she can be saved yet or not.

191
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,380
So if there's still hope for that,
I'm not gonna give up.

192
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,130
Even if she was turned into a witch,

193
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,240
maybe she'd be able to remember the voice of her friend.

194
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,410
I was thinking,

195
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,640
maybe if you call out to her,
she'll remember being human.

196
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,990
If anyone could get through to her,
it'd have to be you.

197
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,030
You think that'll really work?

198
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,780
Oh, how the hell should I know?

199
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,310
Hehe.

200
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,430
Nobody knows, that's what I wanna try!

201
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,050
Hell, it's worth the shot!

202
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,830
Check it out, what if when I cut that witch in half,

203
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,600
instead of getting the usual Grief Seed out of it,

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,590
what if Sayaka's Soul Gem comes
popping out of it instead!

205
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,880
Wouldn't that be something?

206
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,550
It'd be like one of those stories where
love and courage triumph and stuff.

207
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,790
Wanna know something?

208
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,370
And this is between us,

209
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,370
the reason I became a magical girl
was 'cause I love stories like those.

210
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Can't believe I forgot that.

211
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,410
And Sayaka was the one who reminded me.

212
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,210
It's cool if you don't wanna come,
I'm not gonna force you.

213
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,450
I mean, it's gonna be pretty dangerous for sure.

214
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,340
And you know, if things start
getting super hairy in there,

215
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,430
I can't promise I'll be able to protect you.

216
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,620
Uh-uh.

217
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,130
I'll help.

218
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,070
I really wanna help.

219
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,970
My name is Madoka Kaname.

220
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,940
Oh, seriously?

221
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,710
Man, you're so cramping my style.

222
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,360
Huh?

223
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,090
I'm Kyoko Sakura.

224
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,990
Pleased to meet ya.

225
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,690
Uh?

226
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,710
Uhh...

227
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,500
Excuse me.

228
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,430
May I go to the nurse's office?

229
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm not feeling well.

230
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,160
Hmm?

231
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,160
Okay. Who's the nurse's aide for this class.

232
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,630
Miss Kaname is.

233
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,870
But she's not here today.

234
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,070
Hmm...

235
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,270
I guess we'll have the class rep take you then, uh...

236
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,870
Maybe Homura would wanna help.

237
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,270
What do you think?

238
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,390
Doubt it.

239
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,770
Not really her style.

240
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,390
Aren't you guys friends?

241
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,970
Not really.

242
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,390
Well, we sort of got the same goals, I guess.

243
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,750
We kinda teamed up so could beat
whatever we couldn't beat by ourselves.

244
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,910
In a couple of days,
Walpurgisnacht is gonna come to this town.

245
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,140
Walpurgis...?

246
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,040
It's an insanely powerful witch.

247
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,020
This one's so nasty, neither of us could beat it alone.

248
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,810
That's why we decided to team up to kill it.

249
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,270
I guess that's how it is between us.

250
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,600
This is it.

251
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,250
Are you sure it's really Sayaka?

252
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,730
I mean it might be another witch or something?

253
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,630
The magic residue is the same as yesterday.

254
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,560
It's her.

255
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,670
No doubt about it.

256
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,210
Okay, "point of no return" time.

257
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,430
Are you sure you're ready for this?

258
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,190
Actually, I'm used to this part.

259
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,210
The thing is, all I ever did was tag along before.

260
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,950
I've never really been able to help much.

261
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,050
But I'm ready, so take me with you.

262
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,420
You are such a weird girl, ain't ya?

263
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,290
Hey, Kyoko?

264
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,370
Yeah?

265
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,390
I feel bad I can't help.

266
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,470
Everyone else's always done the fighting for me.

267
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,740
Anyway, I sort of feel like a coward.

268
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,430
Why the heck would you ever wanna become a magical girl?

269
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,300
Why?

270
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,200
Um...

271
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,270
Uh-uh.

272
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,230
Don't underestimate this stuff.

273
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,090
This ain't a job anybody can do.

274
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,100
But...

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,730
If you get to eat good food every day
and live a happy life with your family,

276
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,950
why would you give that up
if you're not sure it's what you really want?

277
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,050
You thinking about becoming a
magical girl on some stupid whim?

278
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,940
I'd never allow that to happen.

279
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,650
Hell, like I kick your ass before you could.

280
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,990
If you do this, then you're putting your life in danger.

281
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,360
The only people who should do this are
the ones who's got no other choice.

282
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,070
Anybody else who sticks their
nose in it is just messing around.

283
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,590
And that's dumb.

284
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,260
You think so, huh?

285
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,170
But you never know, right?

286
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,740
Maybe there will come a time

287
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,060
when your back's gonna be up against the wall
and you have to stand up and fight.

288
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,160
If that day ever comes,
you can think about it then.

289
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,360
Mm...

290
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,420
Hey, Kyoko, why did you...

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,630
Ah!?

292
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,550
She knows we're here!

293
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,400
She's coming!

294
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,780
Okay.

295
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,240
Do it just like we planned.

296
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,800
Right.

297
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,830
Hey, Sayaka.

298
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,370
It's me, it's Madoka.

299
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,130
Can...can you here me?

300
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,250
Do you recognize my voice?

301
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,720
Don't be scared! Keep talking to her!

302
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,760
Sayaka, please stop!

303
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,570
Try to remember, please!

304
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,310
I know you never wanted to hurt anyone.

305
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,300
You said you wanted to be a hero, remember?

306
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,340
Please, Sayaka, turn back into your old self!

307
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,040
Man, you're really stubborn.

308
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,490
Come on, Sayaka!

309
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,820
Snap out of it!

310
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,500
Ah!

311
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,140
Kyoko!

312
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,060
I'm okay.

313
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,680
This is nothing.

314
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,790
I have worse...

315
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,650
Just keep talking to her.

316
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,240
Come on, Sayaka!

317
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,050
Stop it!

318
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,490
Please just stop!

319
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,640
Sayaka!

320
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,870
Please try to remember!

321
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,490
Heh.

322
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,080
Oh, I get what you're doing.

323
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,760
This is payback, ain't it?

324
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,180
Funny...

325
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,970
When we met, we tried to kill each other then, too.

326
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,290
I thought you were a wuss.

327
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,800
But no matter how hard I beat you,

328
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,120
man, you just kept getting right back up, didn't ya?

329
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,190
I know you're mad.

330
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,860
You can't forgive anyone for what happened to you.

331
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,630
I get it.

332
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,030
Once you get over that stuff, come back to us, okay?

333
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,270
Sayaka...

334
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,680
Please...

335
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,900
Stop it...!

336
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,830
Dammit, Sayaka!

337
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,300
Come on!

338
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,560
You told me you believed in your power!

339
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,980
You said you were only gonna
use it to help people, remember?

340
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,870
Huh?

341
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,170
Kyoko!

342
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,810
Hey...

343
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,350
Are you...?

344
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,610
Me and my stupid ideas.

345
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,050
She shouldn't have come.

346
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,480
Take care of her.

347
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,400
Uh...

348
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,560
You can't fight and carry her 'cause
you'll just get us both killed.

349
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,040
It's okay.

350
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,930
And you were right.

351
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,140
You've gotta focus on the one
thing that means the most to you,

352
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,760
and protect it to the end.

353
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,650
Heh, it's kinda funny.

354
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, this whole time...

355
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,820
that is exactly what I thought I was doing.

356
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,640
Get out of here.

357
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,140
Don't worry.

358
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,850
I'll take care of her.

359
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,650
I know, Sayaka.

360
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,060
It sucks to be alone.

361
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,830
Believe me, I know.

362
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,230
But it's okay now,

363
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,600
'cause I'm here with you,

364
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,080
...Sayaka.

365
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,200
Kyoko...

366
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,800
I want to know the truth.

367
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,480
Was there any chance for Kyoko
Sakura to save Sayaka Miki?

368
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,780
Of course not.

369
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,930
She should have known that was impossible.

370
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,230
Really?

371
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,390
Then, why didn't you try to stop her?

372
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,490
I would've stopped her if I
thought her dying was pointless.

373
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,620
But the fact is, her death actually
serves a more important purpose.

374
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,680
Walpurgisnacht is coming,

375
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,040
and you're the only magical
girl left to stand in its way.

376
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,650
There's no way you can beat it all by yourself.

377
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,790
So, if Madoka wants to protect this city,
she'll have to become a magical girl.

378
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,320
That won't happen.

379
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,840
I swear it.

380
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,140
No one will believe me about the future.

381
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,330
No one will accept the truth about the future.

382
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,090
I won't rely on anyone anymore.

383
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,190
Huh?

384
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,620
<i>Hitomi, There's something...</i>

385
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,760
<i>Seriously?</i>

386
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,620
<i>After all that's happened,
you're gonna go to school today?</i>

387
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
<i>Think you could meet me somewhere?</i>

388
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,330
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

389
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,740
<i>Hey, God, if you're there, my life sucked.</i>

390
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,250
<i>So, for once...</i>

391
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,550
<i>please...</i>

392
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,960
<i>let me have a happy dream...</i>
