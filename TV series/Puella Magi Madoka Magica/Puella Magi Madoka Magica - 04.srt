1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,940
Oh, are you here to see Kyosuke?

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,520
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,550
His examination got moved up.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,640
He's in Physical Therapy right now.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,090
Oh, okay then.

7
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,720
Thank you.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,950
She comes to see him a lot, doesn't she?

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,870
It's good she does.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,800
He's a difficult case.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,690
He needs encouragement and I think she gives him that.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,340
He was a musical prodigy before the accident, wasn't he?

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,480
The violin?

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,330
Yes.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,830
But even if he figures out how to walk again,
his fingers will never recover enough to play.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,880
Why did it have to be Kyosuke?

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,410
I can move my fingers as much as I want.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,710
But they don't do anything special.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,320
Why couldn't it have been me instead of Kyosuke?

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,970
If I used my wish to heal Kyosuke,
how would he feel about it?

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,590
Would he just say "thanks?"

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,700
Nothing else just "thanks" and that's it?

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,780
Or am I hoping for something more to happen?

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,850
What am I thinking?

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,880
I'm horrible.

26
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,870
Uh-oh.

27
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,400
Hold still.

28
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,440
Oh, got it.

29
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,660
Madoka.

30
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,690
Fast move, kid, you're gonna be late for school.

31
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,730
Mm-hm.

32
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,010
Huh?

33
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,380
Why's Sis crying?

34
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,180
What's wrong? Don't you like your breakfast?

35
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,580
Yeah... it tastes good...

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Really good...

37
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,150
I'm alive...

38
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,730
And your cooking... it tastes so good, Dad...

39
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,480
I was all like "Jeez, Yuka!" really!

40
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,190
I mean, after all that she still doesn't get it.

41
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,120
And then, oh and then, she gets all weepy and goes

42
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,030
"What did I say something weird again?"

43
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,060
I wanted to laugh so hard but I
held it in for as long as I could.

44
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,210
...Me, too!

45
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,620
I couldn't, so I just sat there choking back laughs.

46
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,350
That's so funny.

47
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,980
Ahem.

48
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,530
Let's use the prime age for
childbirth in women as an example.

49
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,310
Sure, it's based on certain medical
facts, but counting backwards from there,

50
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,670
to determine whether a woman's
suitable for marriage is incorrect!

51
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,740
Women over the age of 30 are
absolutely suitable for marriage.

52
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,290
And there's no scientific proof to the contrary.

53
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,020
Now, having said that, and hoping it's
absorbed by your fertile little minds,

54
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,240
we should use the present progressive tense here-

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,370
It sort of...feels like we're
in another country, doesn't it?

56
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,880
Even though nothing's changed, our school is the same,

57
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,290
our class is the same, Hitomi, nothing's changed.

58
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,240
But I feel like I'm surrounded by strangers.

59
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,830
No one else knows, that's why.

60
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,510
No one knows about witches, or Mami.

61
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,620
It's like everyone else is living in
a totally different world than us.

62
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,020
You and me, we are the only ones who know about
all the stuff that's been happening lately.

63
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,040
Sayaka...

64
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,450
Everything changed a long time ago, didn't it?

65
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,740
And the two of us should've figured
that out sooner, don't you think?

66
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,530
So after all this, what we've seen,
do you still wanna be a magical girl?

67
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,870
Yeah, I thought so.

68
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,550
Hey, I understand.

69
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,460
I-I know it's unfair.

70
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,650
I know it's selfish to back out now.

71
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,360
But I...

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,950
I can't...

73
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,040
Just thinking about the way she died...

74
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,530
Even now, it gets so hard to breathe...

75
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,150
I'm scared...

76
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,670
I don't want that...!

77
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,210
Mami...really was the nicest person.

78
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,470
But in order for us to understand what it takes,

79
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,190
the kind of courage it takes to fight,

80
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,580
she can't...

81
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,530
Hey, Kyubey.

82
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,020
What's gonna happen around here now?

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,470
Since Mami's gone, is there someone else around
who's gonna protect everyone from the witches?

84
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,520
This town's been Mami's for a long time.

85
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,090
Once the other magical girls find
out she's gone, they'll come.

86
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,530
I'm sure someone will arrive soon to pick up the hunt.

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
And then what?

88
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,180
All they're gonna care about is finding Grief Seeds.

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,130
Just like that transfer student.

90
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,350
It's true.

91
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,790
Most magical girls hunt for their own benefit,

92
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,060
and it's normal to wanna be paid for your work.

93
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,280
But Mami was a rare breed.

94
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,370
But then...

95
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,870
You don't have the right to judge their actions though.

96
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,220
Only magical girls have that right.

97
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,520
They share the same destiny after all.

98
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,890
Phew.

99
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,930
I understand what you're thinking.

100
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,990
It's a shame, but I can't force you, can I?

101
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,120
Good-bye then.

102
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm off to search for other girls,
who have a greater need to make a contract with me.

103
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,070
I'm sorry, Kyubey.

104
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,700
No, I apologize for getting you mixed up in all this.

105
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,070
We weren't together for very long, but it was fun.

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Thank you, Madoka.

107
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm sorry...

108
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,940
I'm sorry...

109
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,410
for being so weak.,,

110
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm sorry...

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,330
Homura...

112
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,370
You shouldn't blame yourself for what happened.

113
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,100
It couldn't be helped.

114
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,170
Huh?

115
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,560
No one can criticize you for anything.

116
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,830
I mean that.

117
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,320
No one.

118
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,750
I won't allow it.

119
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,970
So then, have you accepted my warning?

120
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
Uh-huh...

121
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,140
I keep thinking, if only I'd listened to you before...

122
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,270
If you had, it wouldn't have changed Mami Tomoe's fate.

123
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,510
I was able to change yours though.

124
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,630
That's good.

125
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,250
So at least I saved one person.

126
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm glad about that.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,020
Um, you know, Homura.

128
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,160
I get the feeling you're a veteran at this too.

129
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,590
I mean like Mami, but different.

130
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,850
Perhaps.

131
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,350
I can't deny it.

132
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,750
And I guess...

133
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,670
you've seen lots of people die horribly, haven't you?

134
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,740
I have.

135
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,310
How many?

136
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,500
I gave up counting long ago.

137
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,570
And her place...is it just gonna stay like that?

138
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,710
Most likely.

139
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
She didn't really have any family to speak of.

140
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,830
And it'll be a very long time
before she's reported missing.

141
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,530
Then, no one's gonna notice Mami's dead?

142
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,110
It can't be helped.

143
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,730
If you die in a labyrinth, your body stays there.

144
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,280
That means in this world,
she'll be considered a missing person forever.

145
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,850
It's a fate all magical girls come accord to,

146
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,160
eventually.

147
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,100
That's awful!

148
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,680
She was all alone, she fought to protect everyone...

149
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,630
And now you're saying no one will know she's gone..?

150
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,920
That's horrible!

151
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,660
It's a condition of the contract we
make, in exchange for our powers.

152
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,200
We're not protectors.

153
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,510
We fight for the sake of our wishes,
and this is how we pay for them.

154
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,490
If we die and no one remembers us,

155
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,030
I guess that's just the way it is.

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll remember her.

157
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,110
I'll never forget her,

158
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,500
never.

159
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,600
I promise!

160
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
I see.

161
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,960
Mami Tomoe is lucky.

162
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,760
She'd be happy to hear that.

163
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,170
How I envy her.

164
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,570
I won't forget you either!

165
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,340
I swear I'll never forget you, Homura,
and how you saved us yesterday!

166
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,710
I'm always gonna remember you!

167
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
Homura?

168
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,990
You're too kind.

169
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,170
Huh?

170
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,380
Remember this, and take it to heart.

171
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,080
Kindness sometimes leads to even greater tragedy.

172
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,610
What are you listening to?

173
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,380
The Girl With the Flaxen Hair.

174
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,950
Oh, that's Debussy.

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,530
It's a beautiful song!

176
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,340
Uh, you know what?

177
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,470
It's kinda funny but...

178
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,920
I don't think people really see me as the type
who listens to stuff like classical music.

179
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,130
And whenever I can name a piece correctly,
seriously you should see their faces.

180
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,570
It's like they're impressed
that I know about that stuff.

181
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,770
Everything I know about it is 'cause of you.

182
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,620
Seriously though, I would never
even listen to classical music ever,

183
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,540
if it wasn't for you, you know.

184
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,190
Hey, Sayaka...

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,160
Huh?

186
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,210
Yeah?

187
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,560
Cut it out.

188
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,350
Stop torturing me already.

189
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,360
Why do you keep coming here?

190
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,450
You think I like listening to this music?

191
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
It's like you're trying to hurt me.

192
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,820
But, Kyosuke, I-I thought you loved music.

193
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,340
I don't wanna hear this crap anymore!

194
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,220
What's the point if I can't play!

195
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,780
All I can do is listen!

196
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,700
I...

197
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,700
I just...

198
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,460
I just, ah!

199
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
I can't move it...

200
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,950
I can't even feel the pain anymore!

201
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,700
My hand's useless.

202
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,170
It's gonna be okay.

203
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,050
I'm sure someday, somehow...

204
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,390
Don't give up hope!

205
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,050
Don't figure something now!

206
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,050
But they came and told me to give up.

207
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,800
They said I'll never play again.

208
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,750
The doctor told me, he said the
current medicine can't help anymore.

209
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,860
My hand is never gonna move right again.

210
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,730
Unless magic and miracles suddenly become real.

211
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,090
But they are!

212
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,040
Miracles, magic, they are real!

213
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,410
Huh?

214
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,080
Is that Hitomi?

215
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,470
Hey, Hitomi!

216
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,020
I thought you were in a practice today.

217
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,570
Where're you...huh?

218
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,220
Hitomi!

219
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,940
Hey, Hitomi come on!

220
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,390
Ah, good evening, Madoka. How are you?

221
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,640
Huh? What happened to you?

222
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,340
Do you know where you are, where you're going?

223
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,930
Where am I going?

224
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm going somewhere wonderful, that's where.

225
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,240
Hitomi...

226
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,780
Oh, yes.

227
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,000
And you simply must come with!

228
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,410
Yes. You'll see.
It'll be so wonderful!

229
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,780
I'm worthless.

230
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,800
It's true.

231
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,060
A failure.

232
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,160
I couldn't even keep this little factory's
door open long enough to turn a profit.

233
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,800
There's no room for a person like me in today's world.

234
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm...obsolete.

235
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,380
Pay attention, Madoka.

236
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,360
These bottles look the same, but this one is dangerous.

237
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,760
Never mix the two of these together, understand?

238
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,990
We could all get really sick and die if you do.

239
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,670
Do not mix them up.

240
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,510
No, stop it!

241
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,160
Don't do that!

242
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,190
This is a sacred ceremony.
We can't have you interrupting it.

243
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,290
But those chemicals're really dangerous!

244
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,190
If you mix them together, everyone here could die!

245
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,500
Yes, and we're all going to go on a wonderful journey,

246
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,850
to a magnificent new world.

247
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,280
Don't you see what an amazing opportunity this is?

248
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,350
We can finally get rid of
these bodies that hold us back.

249
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,320
Oh, Madoka, in a little while you'll understand too.

250
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,530
Let go of me!

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,620
What do I do?

252
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,080
What do I do?

253
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,950
No...

254
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,430
Go away...

255
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:52,880
No.

256
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,520
Someone help me!

257
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,870
Help me!

258
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,020
Sayaka?!

259
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,540
You're so going down!

260
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

261
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,480
I guess I cut it too darn close, didn't I?

262
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,390
Sayaka...

263
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,190
Your clothes.

264
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,480
Huh? Oh, hahaha.

265
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,070
Well, uh, you could say I sort of had a change of heart.

266
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,140
Don't worry. I'll be okay!

267
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,950
I mean I did pretty good for
my first time out, didn't I?

268
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,390
Yeah, but...

269
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,040
How could you..?!

270
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,760
Huh.

271
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,470
You're late, Transfer Student.

272
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,770
I didn't expect you to show up.

273
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,150
I came all this way 'cause I heard old Mami bought it.

274
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,570
So, why don't you tell me something?

275
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,620
What's the deal, huh?

276
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,480
This isn't anything like what you said.

277
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,520
Sorry, but this territory has been
taken over by another magical girl.

278
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,840
She made a contract with me a little while ago.

279
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,390
What the hell?!

280
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,790
That pisses me off!

281
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,620
I mean, I couldn't live with myself

282
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,020
if I just handed prime territory
like this over to some rookie.

283
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,750
That'd be crazy.

284
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,700
What are you going to do, Kyoko?

285
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,750
Simple.

286
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,570
I'll just...

287
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,700
put her dumb rookie ass out of commission.

288
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,190
Permanently.

289
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm excited about this.

290
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,900
Seriously.

291
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,920
From now on, I'll promise that
I - Magical Girl Sayaka

292
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,280
- will do my best to protect
the peace of Mitakihara City!

293
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,080
There's no way I'll ever regret it.

294
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,700
<i>Now that I think about it,
I really didn't understand anything back then.</i>

295
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,850
<i>What it meant to pray for a
miracle, or the price of one.</i>

296
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,450
<i>Sayaka, I need to talk.</i>

297
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,290
<i>Sorry, not now.</i>

298
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,800
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

299
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,830
<i>When I was talking with Homura,
it felt like we could be friends.</i>

300
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,830
<i>I wonder why she and Mami didn't get along?</i>

301
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,590
<i>Huh? It's like what that woman had on her neck!</i>

302
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,660
<i>What should I do?</i>

303
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,110
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

304
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,590
<i>I have to call Homura.</i>

305
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,280
<i>Oh, but I can't!</i>

306
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,990
<i>I don't have her cell number.</i>

307
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,460
<i>I wonder if this...</i>

308
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,520
<i>is my punishment.</i>

309
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,590
<i>For being...</i>

310
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,580
<i>a coward...</i>

311
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,890
<i>and a liar.</i>

312
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,460
<i>I guess this...</i>

313
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,960
<i>is what I deserve.</i>
