1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,370
Homura...

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,520
I am sorry.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,290
But I wanna be a magical girl.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,640
Madoka...

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,060
Don't do it!

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,810
I finally figured it out what I wanna wish for.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,420
I know what I want now more than anything else.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,380
And I'm ready to trade my life for it, with no regrets.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,430
But you can't!

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,650
If you do then,
everything I've fought for...

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,810
...it's all for nothing!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,920
You've been protecting me for a long time,

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,530
and I'll never forget that.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,400
I know you're the reason
that I'm the person I am today.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,620
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,920
I really want this.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,100
It's the answer I've been looking for,

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,430
I swear.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,590
I promise I won't ever let your efforts be in vain.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,720
Believe me, Homura.

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,810
Madoka...

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,300
You are the center of karmic destiny
from many different timelines,

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,360
so no matter how enormous your wish,

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
it most definitely will come true.

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,880
You're sure it will?

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,160
Of course!

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,970
Madoka Kaname,

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,390
what is the wish which you would trade your soul for?

31
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,900
I wish...

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,450
I wish I had the power to erase
witches before they're born.

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,050
Every single witch,

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,270
from the past, present and future,

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,550
everywhere.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,420
Ah...

37
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,190
That wish...

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,990
Once it's granted,
it would unravel the fabric of time itself!

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,770
It violates the laws of karmic destiny!

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,180
Uh? Are you trying to become a god?

41
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,160
I don't care what I become.

42
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,020
All the magical girls,

43
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,010
who believed in hope and fought witches,

44
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,590
I don't want them to suffer or cry anymore.

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,880
I want them to be at peace.

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,570
And if that goes against the laws of universe,

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,550
then I'll just rewrite those laws.

48
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,220
That's the only thing I want.

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,980
It's what I wish for.

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,970
Now, grant my wish,

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,930
Incubator!

52
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,780
Madoka, do you know how scary that wish you made was?

53
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,020
Sort of.

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,240
You'll be fighting an endless battle,

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,820
one that stretches from the past to the future,

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,230
and for all eternity.

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,680
You'll never be the same.

58
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,270
You won't exit as a physical entity anymore.

59
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,890
Dying would be a kinder fate.

60
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,960
For the rest of time,
you'll live on as an entity,

61
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,260
whose sole purpose is to destroy witches.

62
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,440
I know.

63
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,970
And I'm ready.

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,980
If someone ever tells me it's a mistake to have hope,

65
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,240
well then, I'll just tell them they're wrong,

66
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,250
and I'll keep telling them 'til they believe.

67
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,030
No matter how many times it takes.

68
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,660
Sounds good to me.

69
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,940
Huh?

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,110
If you think you can do it, do it!

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,070
I mean, you've found your reason to fight, yeah?

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,520
And you ain't running away anymore, right?

73
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,190
So, there's nothing holding you back!

74
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,020
Anyway, now it's time to get your
ass in gear and go full steam ahead!

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,990
Thanks a lot, Kyoko.

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,880
If that's what you really want,
then it's time you got this back.

77
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,290
Here you go.

78
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,680
Hehehe...

79
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,710
You are not just giving us back our hope,

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
but you are becoming hope itself,

81
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,980
the hope of magical girls everywhere.

82
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,400
That's enough.

83
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,970
It's all right now.

84
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,240
You don't have to hate anyone anymore.

85
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,960
And you don't have to curse anyone anymore either.

86
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,960
I'll go back before you turned into this,
and take the burden of all your pain.

87
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,120
Uh...

88
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,310
Ah!

89
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,260
Where is this place?

90
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,250
The universe is in the process of reordering itself,

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,790
based on Madoka's new laws of reality.

92
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,340
That's right.

93
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,420
Your magic gives you the power
to travel back and forth in time.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,640
Would you like to see how the existence
called Madoka Kaname meets her ultimate end?

95
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,590
That's the Soul Gem her wish created.

96
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,020
Impressive, isn't it?

97
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,420
No way...

98
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,460
The wish she made carries a heavy burden,

99
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,650
imagine all the curses she'll have to take on now.

100
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,450
With all the hope she's harnessing,
she's giving birth to a new universe.

101
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,770
But that means her eventual despair will be so great,

102
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,040
it would destroy another universe.

103
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,240
It's only natural.

104
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,150
Ahh...

105
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
No, it's all right.

106
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,390
Ah...

107
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,850
Remember?

108
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,450
I wished for the power to erase all witches.

109
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,610
And if what I wished for really did come true,

110
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,420
then even I...

111
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,270
...don't have a thing to worry about,

112
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,700
ever!

113
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,640
Madoka...

114
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,830
Because of your wish,
your life has no beginning or end anymore.

115
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,770
The proof of your life on earth is gone.

116
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,120
The memories people had of you don't exit.

117
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,900
You've crossed over onto a higher plane.

118
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,910
Your physical body is no more.

119
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,760
You're now a concept.

120
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,460
No one will ever sense your presence again,

121
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,790
and you will never be able to interact with anyone.

122
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,050
You are no longer a part of this universe.

123
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,030
What are you saying?

124
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,790
Do you honestly think Madoka would want this to happen?

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,470
After everything she's done,
this is her reward?!

126
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,460
I don't believe it!

127
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,120
I can't believe it...

128
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,160
This is worse...

129
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,450
than death...

130
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,340
Uh-uh.

131
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,990
That's not true, Homura.

132
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,460
Now I can see everything that's ever happened,
and everything that ever will.

133
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,130
I see all the universes that could have been,

134
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,480
and all the universes that are waiting to be born.

135
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,570
Really.

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
Madoka...

137
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,980
I see it all,
and I finally know...

138
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
I know all the things you've done for me

139
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,600
through out all those different timelines.

140
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,140
All of it.

141
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,780
All the times you cried and all the time you got hurt,

142
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,390
but you kept fighting for me.

143
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,950
I'm so sorry I never knew until now...

144
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,450
I'm so sorry.

145
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,650
Mm.

146
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,060
I had to become what I am now,

147
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,720
to really know the kind of person you are.

148
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,440
And you were there all alone,

149
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,640
the most amazing friend
someone like me could ever have.

150
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,470
I'm so glad I know now.

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,540
So, thank you, Homura.

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,240
For all that's happened,
you truly were my very best friend.

153
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,050
But...

154
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,350
what's gonna happen to you now that you're like this?

155
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,520
You don't have a home to go anymore...

156
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,200
You'll never be able to see your family and friends...

157
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,750
And you'll be stuck here,

158
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,840
alone by yourself forever and ever..!

159
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,750
Mm-hm.

160
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,340
But I'm not alone.

161
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,090
You're always going to be with me,
and so will everyone else.

162
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,660
Because from now on,
I'll be everywhere for all time.

163
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,780
Even if you can't see me or hear me,

164
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,630
I'll be right there by your side, Homura.

165
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,000
Madoka...

166
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,380
Is that what you want?

167
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,810
Even if I don't remember you ever again?

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
How am I gonna know you're there

169
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,400
when I can't even feel you're
standing next to me anymore?

170
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,470
Uh-uh.

171
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,750
It's a little soon to be giving up hope.

172
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,600
You managed to follow me all
the way out here, didn't you?

173
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,880
Besides, even though you're going back to your world,

174
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,040
maybe you'll still remember me.

175
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,210
I mean, you never know, right?

176
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,550
You'll see, everything will be fine.

177
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,380
Just believe.

178
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,950
Madoka...

179
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,810
We are magical girls, remember?

180
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,930
We make hopes and dreams come true.

181
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,310
They might not happen all the time,

182
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,060
but there's no doubt miracles can really happen.

183
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,450
Don't you think?

184
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,550
Madoka!

185
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,920
Please don't go!

186
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,300
Sorry.

187
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,240
I've gotta go meet the others now.

188
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,730
I don't know when, but I will see you again, Homura.

189
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,920
Promise.

190
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,330
So, until then, take care of yourself, okay?

191
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,170
Madoka!!!!

192
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,020
No.25, Kyosuke Kamijo.

193
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,680
I will be performing "Ave Maria."

194
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,600
Sorry.

195
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,780
I guess I caused you a log of trouble.

196
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,930
No.

197
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,610
I should apologize to you.

198
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,450
In order to save you,

199
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,920
I don't have a choice but to
erase everything that's happened.

200
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,350
But I if I do that, this future will have to disappear.

201
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,030
I know this isn't the way you
thought things would turn out,

202
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,990
but I do think this is the way you'd want it to be.

203
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,410
Your wish was a precious gift,
and you sacrificed so much for it.

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,910
I have to honor it, respect it.

205
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,920
Because it wasn't meaningless.

206
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,460
So...

207
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,370
Mm-hm.

208
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm okay with that.

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,320
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

210
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,890
I mean, all I really wanted was
to hear him play again, you know.

211
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,220
I wanted everyone to hear him play that violin of his.

212
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,110
The more people the better.

213
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,030
Just remembering that again is enough for me.

214
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,580
I don't have any regrets anymore.

215
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,920
I guess one thing still bothers me a little.

216
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,620
That is Hitomi, so let it slide.

217
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,530
Kyosuke doesn't deserve a girl as cool as her.

218
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,200
I'm sure the two of them will be very happy, won't they?

219
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,430
Mm-hm.

220
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,360
Well, are you ready to go?

221
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,600
Yeah...

222
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,730
...Sayaka?

223
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,390
Ah!

224
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,260
Where's Sayaka?

225
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,590
What's up? She was just here!

226
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,300
She's gone.

227
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,130
The Law of Cycle said it has to be this way.

228
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,830
Sayaka used up all her power just now.

229
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,600
That last attack drained all of her magic.

230
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,150
That idiot!

231
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,670
What the hell? She didn't have to go out like that,

232
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,360
especially over some guy she was crushing on..!

233
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
Dammit!

234
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,140
We were just getting around to being friends...

235
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,120
It's the fate of all magical girls though.

236
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm sure you understood that fact
when you first got your powers.

237
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,080
We're supposed to bring hope.

238
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,860
But once it turns into despair,
we have no choice but to disappear...

239
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,680
forever.

240
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,700
Madoka...

241
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,690
Huh?

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,420
What, Homura?

243
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,530
Who is this, Madoka?

244
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,770
Yeah, who is she?

245
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,380
Oh...

246
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,910
Madoka, Madoka!

247
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,750
Uh-huh.

248
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,360
You draw really well.

249
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,700
Looks just like her.

250
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,640
No, Tatsuya! That's not nice.

251
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,160
Don't go around pulling girl's hair, okay?

252
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,690
Madoka, Madoka, Madoka!

253
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,090
Oh, I'm fine.

254
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,190
I was walking by and noticed his drawing.

255
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,830
Madoka, is that right?

256
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,590
...Uh-huh.

257
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,470
Here I come!

258
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,450
Come on, then!

259
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,930
Yeah!

260
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,070
That's it!

261
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,170
Tatsuya came up with an imaginary
friend to play with when he's alone?

262
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,290
I guess it is not that strange for someone his age.

263
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,660
No, it's not.

264
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,450
I used to do that, too.

265
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,610
Wait.

266
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,630
Do you know who "Madoka" is?

267
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,270
Is she some kind of anime character or something?

268
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,150
I don't know, maybe.

269
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,590
I've heard that name before,
but I'm not sure where.

270
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,170
I must've met her somewhere...

271
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,530
maybe when I was out with Tatsuya..?

272
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,160
Hm...

273
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,490
It's funny...

274
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,140
I don't know why but when I heard that name,
I started getting all nostalgic.

275
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,530
Madoka...

276
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,820
It's cute name...

277
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,630
You know that the ribbon has
got to be the cutest thing ever.

278
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,920
And exactly the kind I like too,
same color, same style, everything.

279
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,900
You can have it if you want.

280
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,080
Hahaha...

281
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,970
Thanks, but I'm a little too old to make it work.

282
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,340
But if I had a daughter,
I would've made her wear one just like it.

283
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,210
Hmm...

284
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,390
Interesting.

285
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,470
I suppose the system you just
described could work, theoretically.

286
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,740
It was real.

287
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,310
Nothing theoretical about it.

288
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,940
Well, either way, how would we prove such a thing?

289
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,620
This reality with its rules,
it's the only one we have to go by.

290
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,030
So if the laws of the universe were all altered,

291
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,280
the method to verify it wouldn't exit.

292
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,210
And since you're the only one who remembers that world,

293
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,780
there's no way to prove your memories are real,

294
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,180
or it's something your imagination cooked up.

295
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,740
I'll admit, we don't know why Soul Gems
shatter when they can't be purified anymore.

296
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
That's the phenomenon we're still trying to figure out.

297
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,220
But going back to this witch concept of yours,
I find it very interesting.

298
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,150
As a method of collecting the energy
of human emotions, it's very appealing.

299
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,030
If that kind of system really existed,

300
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,590
us Incubators would've come up with a
completely different set of tactics.

301
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,890
Naturally, after all,
that's the kind of creatures you are.

302
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,600
There were a lot of intriguing
things about that witch world though,

303
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,240
we didn't have to fight wraiths as we do here.

304
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,370
Collecting curses in that other world
seems like it was a much simpler process.

305
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,400
It wasn't really as simple as you think.

306
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,580
And our relationship with you was
...a little on the rocky side.

307
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,880
Hmm...

308
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,920
I guess I'll never fully understand human values.

309
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,750
The air's thick with dread tonight, isn't it?

310
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,060
And these wraiths just keep coming
no matter how many we destroy.

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,690
There's no end to them.

312
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,340
Your complaining isn't going to help.

313
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,580
Come on, let's go.

314
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,760
Ah!

315
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,430
Sorry about that.

316
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,890
Are you okay?

317
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,820
<i>Don't worry.</i>

318
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,840
<i>I won't let your wishes end in despair.</i>

319
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,750
<i>None of you have to hate anyone,
or curse anyone.</i>

320
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,460
<i>I'm here to take all that burden for you.</i>

321
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,250
<i>So please,</i>

322
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,460
<i>keep believing in yourselves,</i>

323
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,260
<i>to the very end.</i>

324
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,530
<i>Even though witches aren't born into this world anymore,</i>

325
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,410
<i>that doesn't mean the curses of the
world have complete disappeared.</i>

326
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,790
<i>They just changed their form, is all.</i>

327
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,670
<i>Now, they attack us from the shadows...</i>

328
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,520
<i>This world isn't worth saving,
tragedies and sadness will never truly disappear.</i>

329
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,510
<i>But even so, it's the place she once tried to protect.</i>

330
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,070
<i>I remember that.</i>

331
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,530
<i>And I will never ever forget it.</i>

332
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,310
<i>That's why...</i>

333
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,710
<i>I keep fighting.</i>

334
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,330
<i>Do your best...</i>
