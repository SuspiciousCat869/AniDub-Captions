[MEGUMIN] Alright, let's see
how you get out of this! Ha!

[AQUA]
Oh, Kazuma,

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:33.167
your goddess demands
her rightful spot by the fire.

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:34.500
Huh?

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.958
See what that says?
Level twenty-one.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.583
So I'm the highest level
in our party.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:41.167
You know what that means,
don't you,

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.792
you poor old
low-level underling?

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:44.625
It means your superior
gets the couch,

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.583
so show some respect
and shoo!

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.083
[annoyed grumble]

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.000
-Uh, wait.
-Huh?

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:51.417
[KAZUMA]
What's up with your stats?

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:53.833
They haven't gone up at all
since we got our cards.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.583
That doesn't mean anything!

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.042
All my stats were maxed out

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.292
from the very beginning,
obviously!

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.125
Don't make the mistake
of lumping me in

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.500
with ordinary adventurers
like you!

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.792
My only choice is to use
my diabolical teleport.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.083
Hey, you cannot use
that now!

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:10.833

[KAZUMA]
Poor thing. She can level up,

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.333
but her intelligence
will always stay the same!

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:28.333
What's wrong with you?
What're you tearing up for?

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.167
You've got this pitiful look
on your face,

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:32.292
like I said something stupid.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.583
[KAZUMA] [crying]
Goodnight.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.292
Wait, Kazuma?!

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.958
[KAZUMA] We got ourselves
a mansion to live in,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.708
and that solved
the problem of us making it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.208
through the winter
without freezing to death.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.000
[sniffling] But there's
some problems we'll never solve.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.000
Geez! What's wrong
with you?!

Dang it, Kazuma, don't go
sneakin' up on us like that!

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.083
[KAZUMA] So, this here's
Keith and Dust,

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.500
a couple adventurers
I met a little while ago.

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:19.542
You guys are acting
way shifty.

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:21.875
What's up?
Is something goin' on down here?

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.500
[BOTH whistling]

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:28.125
Listen, if I tell you,
you gotta swear

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:29.792
-you won't tell the chicks.
-Okay.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.125
There's a shop down there
run by succubi.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:33.417
And they'll give you
the hottest,

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.167
kinkiest dreams

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:36.208
[gasps]

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:38.958
Keep talking.

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.667
[giggling]

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.375

Hah!

00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.292
No way would I ever set foot

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.833
in a place
like this on my own.

-[SUCCUBUS] Welcome!

00:04:34.583 --> 00:04:36.792
Right this way, handsome.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.792
Um. Sure.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.208
You boys can come with us.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.542
-R-right!
-Oh, man.

Whoa! You!

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.792
Welcome to the doorway
to Hell.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.625
Don't dream anything
I wouldn't, tough guy!

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:05.417
-[laughs]
-No, I won't.

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:07.333
[GUILD MEMBER] [chuckles]
Yeah! I bet!

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:11.750
[KAZUMA]
Occupation, artisan weaver?

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:14.792
That dude ain't even
an adventurer?!

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.375
[SUCCUBUS]
Sir? Sir?

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.333
Um! Yes?!

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:20.500
Relax, sweetie!

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:22.333
Is this your first time
visiting our shop?

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:23.708
Y-Yes?

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.417
Then, I'll tell you
about our service.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.458
[KAZUMA]
Yes, please.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.667
We succubi have

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:29.792
a mutually beneficial
relationship

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.833
with the male adventurers
of this town.

00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:33.125
-[KAZUMA] Uh-huh.
-I'm sure you've noticed

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:35.333
how many of them
are forced to live in stables?

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:37.208
-Yup.
-In a situation like that,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.708
it's normal to get "pent-up."

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.208
And without any privacy,
releasing one's tensions

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.208
-can be risky.
-Mm-hmm.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.750
I know I shouldn't
feel guilty about being here,

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:48.333
but still...

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.083
On second thought, I got
nothin' to feel guilty about!

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:53.375
For example,
if one forced himself

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.625
on a female adventurer
sleeping nearby,

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:58.250
his stable-mates would notice
and beat him so bad,

00:05:58.292 --> 00:05:59.792
-he'd pee blood for a month.
-[KAZUMA yelps]

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:02.250
There's also a chance
the female whips out a dagger

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:04.500
and cuts off her attacker's
you-know-what,

00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:06.625
which would be
both fatal and messy.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.375
H-has that happened
to someone here before?!

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:13.333
That said, we succubi
give male adventurers

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:16.875
erotic dreams that bring them
relief without any risk.

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:19.875
We take a tiny bit
of your vitality in return.

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:21.250
But don't worry,
it's not so much

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:23.625
that it affects your daily life
or adventures.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:24.667
[gasps]

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.333
This is awesome!
This is so awesome!

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:31.667
If every guy did this
on the regular,

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:33.625
there'd be no more war!

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.333
Please fill out this form

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:38.250
and if you have any questions,
don't hesitate to ask.

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:43.667
Huh? So, like, it's asking
for my preferred situation,

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:45.875
gender, and appearance
in my dream.

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.792
Can I be anything?

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:50.042
Yes, you can choose
to be a king or a hero.

00:06:50.083 --> 00:06:51.417
Whatever you want.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.500
Experiencing a dream
as a female

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.458
is also a popular choice.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.083
Oh, you don't say,

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:01.250
Some customers choose
to be a young boy again.

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:03.625
Their dreams usually
involve them being subdued

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:06.042
by a strong female adventurer.

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:07.625
[ADVENTURER chuckles]

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:10.625
[KAZUMA] This town's got some
supremely kinky dudes in it.

00:07:12.042 --> 00:07:14.625
Um, about this
"partner preferences" one,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.333
how detailed can I get
with it?

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.792
You can choose
their looks, personality,

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:21.250
speech patterns,
and even how much they like you.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:25.083
Your partner can be anything
or anyone, real or imagined.

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:27.542
-No way, really?!
-Yes, really.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:30.667
So then even if I pick
a celebrity or a girl I know

00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:33.000
or a 2D waifu,
you can make it happen?

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:36.167
Yes. Even a "2D waifu,"
whatever that might be.

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:38.083
[clears throat]
I won't get in trouble

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:41.167
using someone's image
without their okay, will I?

00:07:41.208 --> 00:07:43.708
No, not at all.
It is just a dream.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.792
Yeah, you're right, it is!

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.250
Hey, while we're on the subject,
is there an age restriction

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.083
on the type of girl
I want in my dream?

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.833
Not that I'm some kind
of pedo or anything.

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.083
Just curious.
Askin' for a friend, in fact!

00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:56.708
[SUCCUBUS]
There's no restriction.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.083
Choose the age you like.

Um, you sure about that?

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:04.458
There's no, like, laws
about that kind of stuff?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.542
No, there's not.
It is a dream, after all.

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.792
Yeah, you're right, it is!

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.625
Of course it's okay,
it's just a dream!

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:14.042

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.792
I'm so happy
I joined this party!

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.833
Are those things really
that big a deal?

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:08.458
Absolutely!

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.208
If you told me
I could eat this crab

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.167
as long as I didn't blow up
anything for one whole day,

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.125
I'd gladly restrain the urge!

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:16.500
They're that delicious!

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.708
And then I'd unleash
a ferocious Explosion

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.042
right after I ate!

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.792
Wow, that good, huh? Wait.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.042
What'd you say
at the end there?

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:24.958
[shell cracks]

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.167
Aah!

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:39.417
[BOTH fawning]

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:40.625

Yum.

[slurps]

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.917
Oh my god!

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.417
I can't stop myself!

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:53.958
[slurps]

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.333
Crack!

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:56.333
[slurps]

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:58.083
Crack! Mm!

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.292
Crack!
[slurps]

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.125
[eating noisily]

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:03.375
[AQUA]
Hey, Kazuma!

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:05.333
Could you light
this stove up for me?

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.125
I know a tasty way
to drink this stuff,

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:08.417
and I wanna show everyone!

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.000
-[KAZUMA] Mm-hmm.
-[MEGUMIN] Mm-hmm.

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.083
[KAZUMA]
Tinder!

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:14.625
[AQUA] You put a shell
filled with crab guts

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:16.583
on the grill and then...

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.625
[hums, giggles]

00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:22.417
It should be ready now.

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:24.750
[slurping]

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.750
[gulps]

[exhales]

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.875
[KAZUMA/MEGUMIN/DARKNESS]
Gulp.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:32.625
[KAZUMA]
I wanna try!

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.750
[humming]

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:35.708
[gasps]

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.125
No, you idiot!

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:39.625
That succubus lady said
no alcohol!

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:41.250
I might drink too much
and get hammered,

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:42.500
and I won't get
my dream!

00:10:43.917 --> 00:10:47.000
[DARKNESS] Having
second thoughts? Very well.

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:50.292
[KAZUMA] Calm down, dude.
You don't need to drink tonight.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.750
It's just booze,
so keep your eyes on the prize

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:54.792
and you'll get through this!

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:57.958
[gulping, exhales]

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.042
This is delicious!
And so light!

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:01.250
[KAZUMA]
Don't be tempted!

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:03.042
You're stronger than that!
Resist!

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:05.583
Once you get a taste,
you know you'll have another!

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.958
Please give me a little sip!
It won't hurt me or anything!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.375
You are still a child!

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:12.417
Do you want your life
to end up in the gutter?

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.292
-Fill your shells and drink up!
-Hmm?

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:15.875
I'm in such a good mood

00:11:15.917 --> 00:11:18.417
I'm gonna show you
all my brand new party trick!

00:11:18.458 --> 00:11:20.292
With a flick of my fingers,

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:22.667
I'm the mobile fortress,
Destroyer!

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:24.625
Whoa, no way!

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.625
Th-that's the Destroyer,
alright!

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:28.375
That's exactly how it moves!

00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:30.708
Indeed, you are
the spitting image of it!

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.583
[KAZUMA] If I knew what
a Destroyer was, maybe I'd care!

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:36.125
Do it again, Aqua!
Please, please, please!

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:38.708
You can't just snap your fingers
and expect art.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.417
It comes from the soul and only
when the artist is inspired

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:42.625
to share it with the world.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:45.000
Huh? What is wrong, Kazuma?

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:47.292
You have such
a concerned look on your face.

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.292
-Do you not like the food?
-No, it's great.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.917
I just can't drink now!

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.458
See, I met some friends
at a bar in town today,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.208
and I guess
I kinda overdid it.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.375
But I'll totally
try it out tomorrow!

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.542
If you say so!

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:02.375
[KAZUMA]
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:04.375
What's with the innocent look
all of a sudden?!

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:05.833
She always says
the perviest things

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:08.417
and now, now she's acting
all sweet and normal!

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:10.000
Eat up, then.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.708
It's my thanks to you.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.958
For everything.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.500
[KAZUMA] Ugh, I feel like
such a dog now.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.833
What am I doing?

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.250
I should just get
plastered with them

00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:21.000
and forget all about
the dream.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.042
Look at everyone having fun.

00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.458
Is a hot dream
really that big a deal?!

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.042
Come on, man,

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.458
Deep down, you know
what's more important here.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.917
[laughter]

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.208
[DARKNESS/AQUA/MEGUMIN]
Huh?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.917
Well, I hate to be
a party-pooper, guys,

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.125
but I'm gonna hit
the sack early.

00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:40.958
So, uh, night.

Oh my god, I better--
Whoa, hang on.

and closing my eyes before.

enhanced her

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.292
to suit my taste more?

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.833
I can work with that.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.417
I kinda like it, actually.

It's kinda trippy
they whipped you up

00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:46.167
to be in my dream, though.

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:47.375
I guess it's 'cause
I requested

00:14:47.417 --> 00:14:49.333
a hot older woman
with a rockin' bod.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:50.833

talking about?!

-What do you think?
-I-I mean, th-that is to say,

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.917
I-I do not know what to say,
is what I mean to say!

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.667
H-How dare you ask me
to scrub your back

00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:00.500
a-and what do you mean
by dream a-and...

00:15:00.542 --> 00:15:02.625
Oh, my head is spinning
right now. I cannot even--

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.125
Sorry, it's cute and all,

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.333
but I didn't order
the "hard to get" type.

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:08.250
Wait a minute,
I did want a shy,

00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:11.083
inexperienced, older woman,
which is the same thing, really.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:13.833
-Eh, you'll do.
-Huh?

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:15.917
Look,
the innocent thing's great

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.875
and I appreciate that,
but come on now.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.708
Scrub my back already!

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.542
But I, um...

00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:23.917
Considering the fact
that we are both naked,

00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.083
do you think my doing that
would be wise?

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.750
Oh my god,
would you hurry up!

00:15:27.792 --> 00:15:29.542
The anticipation's killing me!

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:31.042
[DARKNESS]
H-have you no shame?!

00:15:31.083 --> 00:15:33.417
D-do you understand
what you are asking of me?!

00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:36.333
Wh-why if Aqua or Megumin
saw us, they'd--

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:38.542
I'm cool if they do
and if they wanna join in,

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:39.792
that's cool with me, too.

00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:41.792
[gasps]
What happened to you?!

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.167
How can you say such
wicked things so casually?!

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:46.167
Would you put a sock
in it already?!

00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.458
You keep screaming like that,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.542
and you're gonna wake up
the whole damn town!

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:51.958
Quit being unreasonable
and get to scrubbing me.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.792
How can you expect me
to be reasonable

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.333
when you are making
such lecherous comments?!

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:59.625
Wait. A-am I the only one
with common sense here?

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.292
O-or have I gone mad?!

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:04.167
You're not crazy,
just a little weird is all.

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.875
And sorry for lashin' out
about the yelling.

00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:07.958
It's a dream, so go ahead.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.375
Now... get to scrubbin'!

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.375
[sobbing]

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.667
[trembling breaths]

00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:23.500
I cannot believe this.

00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:25.458
To be ordered around
so brazenly

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.750
and not having
the wherewithal to resist.

00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.333
How pathetic!

00:16:29.375 --> 00:16:31.542
I can't believe
this is happening, either.

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.708
I've never been confident
with the ladies,

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.958
so it's kinda nice
havin' one act all shy

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.667
-and embarrassed with me.

00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:39.250
Wh-why, you...

00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:40.667
I have had enough of this

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.875
newfound worldly attitude
of yours!

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:45.750
Th-there. I-I have done
what you asked of me,

00:16:45.792 --> 00:16:48.375
so m-may I p-please
leave now?

00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:50.417
Not even, you're just
getting started!

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:52.292
Even though I set you
for inexperienced,

00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:54.250
don't forget you still gotta
dry me off.

00:16:54.292 --> 00:16:56.083
-Without a towel.
-[gasps]

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:57.500
Why, I never!

00:16:57.542 --> 00:16:59.042
I-I might be inexperienced

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:01.458
in the ways of pleasure,
but that is definitely...

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.792
-[KAZUMA] Come on,
-[DARKNESS] ...t-totally,

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.042
wrong.

00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:08.042
[KAZUMA]
I'm waiting.

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.125
Hurry!

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.167
[deep breaths]

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:16.542
[moans]

00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:19.667
[AQUA] Ah-ha! Caught you!
Wake up, everyone!

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:21.042
There's an intruder
in the house!

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.833
-Huh?
-That was Aqua.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.792
If I wanted a distraction now,
I would have ordered one!

00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:27.750
Even in my dreams
she's a pain!

00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:29.875
I'm gonna go tell her off!

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:31.542
[DARKNESS]
K-Kazuma?

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:32.667
[grunts]

00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:33.917
There you are!

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:38.125
Oh, hey! I have her trapped
in my barrier, so don't worry.

00:17:38.167 --> 00:17:40.125
-She's not going any whuu...
-[MEGUMIN gasps]

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:41.917
Ew! Put some clothes on,
you perv!

00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.083
I-I was takin'
a bath and--

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:47.583
[KAZUMA] It's one
of them succubusses.

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:51.667
I put a magic barrier around
the house, and it caught her.

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:54.708
She's a succubus, so I bet
she was after you, Kazuma.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.625
[KAZUMA] That's weird.
What's she doing out here?

00:17:58.667 --> 00:18:01.708
Wait, if she's here,
then who was in the bath just--

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.125
Ohh.

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.917
I'll exorcize this little hussy
in nothing flat!

00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.500
Now be good and let us
destroy you.

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.250
[yelps]

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.250
Say your prayers, succubus!

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:14.375
I'll be using my most powerful
anti-demon spell on-- Huh?

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:15.375
[gasps]

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:19.875
Huh?

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.375
[KAZUMA]
Run.

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:24.417
But, sir. I--

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:26.000
We can't let her go!

00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:27.708
That demon broke in here
because it wanted

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.875
to suck the life out of you!

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:30.500
Get away from her, Kazuma!

00:18:31.667 --> 00:18:33.458
This is my fault, sir.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.875
If I weren't so new at this,

00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:36.292
I would have known
about the barrier

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.667
and not gotten caught.

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:40.708
I will accept my fate
to protect your reputation.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.958
Please, sir.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.958
Pretend you don't know me

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.875
and let your friend
exorcize me!

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.375
Think of yourself!

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:49.958
[AQUA]
What's your problem?!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.750
If you think
a goddess like me

00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:54.917
is going to let a demon
like her go, you're crazy.

00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.542
I'm warning you, step aside
and let me at her,

00:18:57.583 --> 00:18:59.375
or I'll beat you senseless.

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:01.625
[grimaces]

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.875
Stop, do not hurt him!

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:06.167
He has been charmed
by that succubus!

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.792
That is the only explanation for
his strange behavior of late!

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:12.250
He has been going on and on
about dreams and requests

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:14.208
and all sorts
of devilish things!

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.417
That cursed succubus put me
through such humiliation!

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:19.208
I shall kill her myself!

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.542
Don't be fooled, Kazuma.

00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:23.083
She might be cute,
but she's still a monster!

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:25.500
She's our enemy,
you idiot!

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:27.042
[KAZUMA]
Go.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.500
But, sir.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:29.708
Alright, then.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.333
If you wanna do this
the hard way,

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.083
we'll do this the hard way.

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.667
As soon as I get through
beating you to a pulp,

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.542
I'm going to send your
little demon friend to hell.

Come get some.

00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.375
There are some things
you gotta protect

00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:54.625
with your life.

00:19:58.167 --> 00:20:00.375
Let's rock!

Fine, if you're not gonna
say something, I will.

00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:34.875
I feel bad for all
the crap you say I did,

00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:36.458
but it's not like
you couldn't have stopped it

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.750
if you really wanted to.

00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:39.750
[gasps]

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.500
Then you really,
truly do not remember

00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:46.458
what happened
in the bath last night?

00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:48.833
Nothing?

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:50.125
Neither the things
you said

00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:51.917
nor had me do?

00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.167
Not even the succubus?

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:54.417
No.

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:56.500
I don't remember
any of that stuff.

00:20:56.542 --> 00:20:59.458
I woke up feelin' like I had
a nice dream, though.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.083
Oh. A-alright.
That's good, then.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.958
Well, what's done is done.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.750
It was an accident.
I, too, should forget it.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.042
[KAZUMA] Last night, I was
mind-controlled by a succubus.

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:15.625
That's what
I'm tellin' everyone!

00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:17.042
It's a convenient excuse,

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:18.792
and I'd be crazy
not to run with it.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:19.917
[chuckles]

00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:22.083
I have to admit,
I was quite shocked

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:23.833
by how forceful
you behaved,

00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:26.333
but it was also
sort of thrilling.

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:29.292
It was, however, unacceptable
to make me do things

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.292
I clearly had
no concept of.

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.208
Please, you got
as much common sense

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.875
as the next girl to have known
what was going on.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:37.958
No way are you as innocent
as you say you are!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Wha--

00:21:39.042 --> 00:21:40.333
Oh, and you walked in

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:41.375
on me, remember.

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:43.542
So how can any of this
be my fault?

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.583
I mean, I did light
the lanterns.

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:47.292
And I even put the sign
on the door.

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:49.708
You knew I was in there
and you came in anyway...

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.792
[gasps]
I-I knew it!

00:21:51.833 --> 00:21:54.917
Y-you do remember what happened
last night, don't you!

00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.833
Was that succubus
really controlling you,

00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:58.417
or were you aware
of your actions?!
