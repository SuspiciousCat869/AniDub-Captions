with you people?!

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.792
Why do you keep
bombarding my castle?!

has been blowing up my castle

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.333
every day
for the past week!

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.250
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.542
-You idiot!
-Oww!

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.083
Wait! I can explain!
I can explain!

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:47.958
U-up until recently,
casting my spell

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.958
on an empty plain
was enough for me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.583
But ever since
tasting the pleasure

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.000
of blowing up a castle,
it's different.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.042
Now I have to unleash
on something big

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.083
and hard to feel satisfied.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.417
Don't squirm! I get it!
It turns you on!

Wait, hold the phone!

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.500
You can't move after you do
your spell!

unless someone carries you--

It's his fault there aren't
any good quests anymore,

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.417

to get him back for it!

Your fiery taunts offend me,

but there is something else.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.500
None of you have come yet
seeking retribution

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:32.417
for your ally's death!

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.250
In life, I strove to be
an upstanding knight.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.708
In my opinion,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.292
that crusader was
an ideal knight.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.583
She used her body to shield
an ally from my death curse

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.458
and to abandon her is--

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.458
Gah!

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:53.458
Gosh. I-I'm "ideal"?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.125
I'm flattered you think so!

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.667
Wait. You're--

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:00.958
You're alive?!

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:37.083
How are you still alive?!

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:38.625
Can you believe it?!

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:41.375
The silly old Dullahan didn't
know I dispelled his curse!

00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:44.417
He's been sitting in his castle
this whole time waiting for us!

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.917
[snickering]

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.333
I bet he sat there stewing
about it like a little kid!

[VERDIA]
I'm warning you!

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:52.875
Stop your taunts,
or I will destroy

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.417
every living thing
in this town!

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:57.208
Not after I get through
with you!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.875
Do you honestly think
the magic of a novice can--

Go forth,

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.625
and show this lot
a glimpse of hell!

See?! Your spell did work!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.667
It freaked him out so bad,
he needs backup!

-Mm-hmm.
-Th-they are not backup!

In battle, you do not get
to fight the boss first!

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:51.167
You fight minions first, then--

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.417
Yeah, whatever.

doesn't affect him at all!

He yaa-ed, rolled around a bit.

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:08.750

That Kyouya?

No, Darkness!
You can't take him on alone!

a little more!

Instead of stripping it
all away,

he has chosen which parts
to leave intact.

00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.250
because I beat him
at arm-wrestling once.

00:17:56.292 --> 00:18:00.458
And for Heinz, who would insist
I fan him with my sword.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.000
He said my aim was so bad,
he was in no real danger.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:08.000
And last, for Galil,
who let me join his party.

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:11.208
He screamed at me for charging
into a horde of monsters,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.000
then kicked me out
after one day.

00:18:14.458 --> 00:18:17.500
Allies cut down
by the Dullahan's blade.

00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:20.042
If I could see them again...

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.458
...I would love to have
a drink with them.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.792
-[MAN 1] Umm...
-[MAN 2] Yeah...

00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:31.375
I didn't know me teasing you
about your aim

00:18:31.417 --> 00:18:32.833
bothered you so much.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:35.833
So, like,
I'm sorry about that.

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:37.708
I won't do it again.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.458
You're all alive?

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:44.583
For someone like me,

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:47.750
resurrecting fallen adventurers
is a piece of cake!

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:48.625
Resurrection!

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:52.083
Now, you can have
that drink together! [chuckles]

00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:55.292
[MAGE 1] Darkness must be
so embarrassed right now.

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:57.083
Quiet, she'll hear you!

00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:58.958
Please kill me.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.458
Oh, you love this.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.708
For the next couple days,

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.583
you'll be what
everyone's talking about.

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:05.958
Y-you misunderstand.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.958
This is not the kind
of humiliation I like!

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.875
I feel like a fool!
[crying]

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:16.583
-[AQUA] Ko.
-[MEGUMIN] No.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.125
-[KAZUMA] Su!
-[DARKNESS] [crying] Ba!

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.875
[PEOPLE chattering]

00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:24.500
[KAZUMA] I managed
to survive another quest.

00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:26.458
But from now on,
I'm gonna take it easy

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.083
and avoid all the danger.

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.292
It's about time
you showed up!

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:32.708
Darkness is being mean
to me.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.375
She won't let me have
a drink!

00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:36.208
She says I'm too young!

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.125
-All spoiling my fun!
-I am sorry, but the legal--

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:40.917
[chuckles] You're late,
poophead! Ha ha!

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500
[KAZUMA]
Damn, she's drunk already?!

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:47.792
[LUNA] Oh! Kazuma!
At last, you're here.

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:50.625
Perfect! I have
a special reward set aside

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:52.292
for just you
and your party.

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:54.250
What? Seriously?

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:55.833
-[grunts]
-[AQUA groans]

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:58.583
Thank you,
but why's it just for us?

00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.583
[MAN] You beat a general
of the Devil King's army.

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:02.917
Buddy,
I could tell you had

00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:05.917
all that potential
bubblin' inside ya.

00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.292
Potential to do what,
big guy?

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.667
To shine a light
on the gates of Hell.

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:14.125
To be the hero
this world needs.

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:15.083
He's right.

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:16.333
If it wasn't for you,

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:18.833
we never would have beat
that Dullahan!

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:22.000
[ALL] [chanting]
Kazuma! Kazuma!

00:20:22.042 --> 00:20:25.292
Kazuma! Kazuma!

00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:27.208
[KAZUMA]
They're cheering me.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.333
-How rad is that?!
-[chanting continues]

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.917
Ahem!

00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:34.083
In recognition of Kazuma
and his party's achievement,

00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:37.333
I award them
three hundred million eris.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:39.583
[ALL]
Th-three hundred million?!

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:41.500
[MAN]
Buy me a drink, Kazuma!

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:43.750
[WOMAN]
Yeah! Buy us all drinks!

00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:45.125
Meeting!

00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:47.417
So, we gotta talk
about something.

00:20:47.458 --> 00:20:48.958
[AQUA] My spell beat him,
so it's only fair

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.500
to split the haul
ninety-ten.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:53.750
Look, now that we got
all this money, I'm retiring.

00:20:53.792 --> 00:20:55.500
Seriously, I'm done
with questing!

00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:56.958
-Wait a moment.
-[KAZUMA] Not waiting.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.208
If I cannot fight strong enemies
anymore, that is a problem.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.042
[KAZUMA]
It's not a problem!

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:01.333
I don't like this, either.

00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:02.958
I joined you specifically

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.417
so I could defeat
the Devil King

00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:06.000
and earn the title
of strongest mage.

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:06.792
[KAZUMA]
You'll never earn it!

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:08.750
Why do you wanna be a
shut-in NEET again?

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:10.500
There's no "again,"
'cause I was never a NEET!

00:21:10.542 --> 00:21:12.125
[AQUA] You said
you'd get me back home!

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.667
[KAZUMA] Too bad.
Already made up my mind!

00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:14.917
-[AQUA] What?!
-[KAZUMA] I don't wanna die,

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.292
-you useless go--
-[LUNA] Um, Kazuma?

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:19.542
Is that our check?
Is it?

00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:20.917
-Is it?!
-Gah.

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:23.667
I'm sorry.

00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:26.750
The water Aqua summoned
damaged the outer walls.

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.792
True, it happened
while defeating a general

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:30.292
of the Devil King's army.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.667
Which is quite
the accomplishment! Really!

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.792
So, I can't ask you to pay
the full sum of the repairs.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:38.750
But it would be great
if you paid a portion of it.

00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:39.792
Stop.

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:42.000
There goes our reward.

00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:43.042
Three hundred million

00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:44.333
minus three hundred
forty million

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:45.583
in repairs.

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:48.583
Our bloody journey
of magic continues.

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:50.208
So much for your retirement!

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.042
Tomorrow,
we shall find a quest

00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:53.875
with a strong,
profitable enemy.

00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:56.875
And we'll split the debt.
E-equally, of course!

00:21:57.958 --> 00:22:00.042
[KAZUMA] Oh my god,
do I have to spend

00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:02.417
the rest of my life
with this bunch of losers?!

00:22:04.042 --> 00:22:06.042
At this point,
all I can do

00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:08.458
is close my eyes and commit
to kill the Devil King.

00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:11.458
'Cause that's the only way
I'll ever get out

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.833
of this hellhole.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.833
[MEGUMIN]
My name is Megumin.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:48.083
I leave this record

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:51.292
so future generations
can know of my exploits.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:53.750
The mighty magic of
the magnificent magician Megu--
