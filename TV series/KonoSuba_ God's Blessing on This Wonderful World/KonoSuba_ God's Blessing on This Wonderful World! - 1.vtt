00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:17.542
[KAZUMA] I never go out
if I don't have to.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.125
But today's one of
those days when I have to.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.000
[zipper buzzing]

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.583
[KAZUMA] The limited edition
of a popular MMO

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.292
is going on sale,
and I'm gonna snag one.

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:34.583
[engine rumbling]

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:42.542
Five hours later,
target acquired!

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:44.125
Man, these
in-store exclusives

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.917
sure can cramp
a guy's lifestyle!

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.417
[KAZUMA] After three
all-nighters in a row,

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.917
the sun's my worst enemy.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.417
Gotta get inside
and play this!

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:02.083
She's from my high school.

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:05.667
Whoa! [gasps]

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.292
Look out!

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.875
The truck's gonna--

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:10.750
[KAZUMA grunts]

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.792
[KAZUMA] Why'd I pick today
of all days to play hero.

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.292
Uh! Uh...

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.625
-[footsteps approaching]
-[KAZUMA] Huh?

00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:34.375
[GIRL]
Kazuma Satou...

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.250
...welcome to the afterlife.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:39.625
Huh.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:40.875
[GIRL]
A few moments ago,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.250
you passed on.

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:43.583
My condolences.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.833
Your life was quite short.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:50.708
Huh?

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:54.083
And now you are quite dead.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.042
[KAZUMA]
So, uh...

00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:33.625
...what about the girl?

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:34.625
She okay?

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:37.625
[GIRL]
Yes, she's fine.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.250
Thank God.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:44.375
At least my death counted
for something good.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.042
[GIRL] Actually,
even if you hadn't pushed her

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:50.500
out of the way
like you did,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:51.833
she'd still be fine.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:52.917
Huh?

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.792
A tractor can't go that fast,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.625
so it would've stopped
before it hit her.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:58.458
Whoa! H-hold it,
back up a sec!

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.500
What is it?

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:01.125
That was a tractor?

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.500
[GIRL]
Yes. A little red one.

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.333
But then how'd I die?!

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:08.875
I mean, did I, like, get
run over by it or something?

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:10.917
Oh no. You died of shock.

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.167
Apparently, you thought
it was a truck.

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.292
You're kidding!

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.292
[snorts, laughs]

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.667
Ah!

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.792
Sorry! I've been doing this
for a long time,

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.500
and you're the first human
I ever met

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:24.750
who died so ridiculously!

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.250
-[snickering]
-[KAZUMA] The hell?

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:28.708
She's making fun
of me dying!

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.500
[GIRL] You were so scared
to be run over,

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.042
you wet your pants!

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:33.792
Then you passed out
and at the hospital,

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.750
the doctors and nurses laughed
while you had a heart attack!

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:38.250
No! Shut up! Lalalala!

00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:40.292
I don't wanna hear it!
I don't wanna hear it!

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.333
Your family's at the hospital
right now

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.333
and were just told
about out how you died?

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.250
And even they're laughing!

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:47.083
Oh god, no! Stop it!

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.125
-Stop it!
-[GIRL] Phew!

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:52.125
There's nothing like laughter
to ease the stress of one's day.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.042
[KAZUMA]
Damn her!

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:55.708
I'm the goddess Aqua.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.667
When a young person dies
in Japan,

00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.833
it's my job to guide them
to the afterlife.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:03.333
Now that you are here,
you have a couple of options.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.917
You can either reincarnate
and return to Earth,

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.875
or you can go to Heaven
and putter around

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.917
like an old man
for eternity.

00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958
But just between you and me,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.958
Heaven is nothing
like the dreamy place

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.417
you humans imagine
it being like.

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:16.542
Huh?

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.875
There's no TV
or manga or games.

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:20.583
And since you don't have
a physical body,

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.542
you can't have sex.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.583
[whimpers]

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.167
[AQUA] You'll just bask in
the sun till the end of time.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.375
Whenever that happens.

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:29.500
What?

00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:31.500
Sounds totally boring,
I know!

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.625
You don't want to go
somewhere like that, do you?

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.625
Uhh, I guess not?

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:37.000
Starting over from scratch

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:39.000
isn't all it's cracked up
to be, either.

00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:41.708
But I have another option
I know you'll love!

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.000
You're young.
I bet you like games!

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.208
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.125
In a faraway land,

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:49.167
peace and prosperity
are being threatened

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:51.667
by the Devil King
and his army!

00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:54.042
The innocent are being trampled
by monsters!

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:55.958
Destroyed in the blink
of an eye!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Fear rules the land,

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.583
as the Devil King's army rapes

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.125
and pillages
and slaughters and...

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:02.458
...more slaughters!

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.750
[gulps]

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.875
Life is so hard there,
the population is in decline

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.125
because no one wants
to reincarnate back into it.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:11.375
Fun.

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:13.333
To help, we decided
to send young people

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:15.208
who died in other worlds
to that one

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.458
and let them keep
their bodies and memories.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.750
Pretty clever, huh!

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:20.458
But what's the point
of sending me there

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.958
if I'm gonna
be killed anyway?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.708
-[AQUA] I'm glad you asked!
-Uh...

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.708
If you decide to go,
I will let you choose one thing

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.958
and take it with you.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It can be anything,
like a powerful weapon

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:31.167
or a special ability.

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.542
You can have a new life

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.917
and keep all your memories
from your old one.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.167
Plus, you can have
an awesome power or weapon!

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:42.583
That world needs a hero,
and you can be its hero!

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.500
That's some deal,
don't you think?

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.833
[KAZUMA]
Umm, just wondering.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:52.458
Won't I have to learn
this world's language?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.833
Oh. Right, well,
we already thought of that.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.458
Thanks to the kind support
of us gods,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.125
we'll load the language
into your brain.

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:01.375
You'll be able to speak
and read it

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.250
right when you arrive.

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:04.792
There's a chance
you'll get overloaded

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:06.292
and go poof,
but that's rare.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.292
Anyhoo, just pick
a skill or weapon,

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.500
and I'll go ahead
and send you on your way!

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:16.542
You just mentioned something
that sounded serious.

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:17.917
Something about going "poof."

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.917
-No, I didn't!
-[KAZUMA] Yeah, you did.

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.333
-[heroic music playing]
-Time to choose!

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.875
I have tons of options
and they're all amazing,

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.792
so pick one
and I'll send you on your way!

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.292
[KAZUMA] Maybe it's
my gamer's intuition talking,

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:36.042
but these skills
and gear are kinda whack.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:38.083
Hell, if I'm going someplace
where there's magic,

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.875
I gotta pick
something magic-ish!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Come on. Hurry it up.

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:45.083
It doesn't matter
what you pick, anyway.

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.500
In the end, you'll still just be
a shut-in gamer geek.

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.625
Hey, don't you
call me a geek!

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:50.750
And I'm not a shut-in!

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.500
I died outside my house!

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:57.667
Details, shmetails,
just hurry it up already.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.667
I've got loads more dead humans
to guide besides you, y'know.

00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:02.000
[KAZUMA]
Damn her!

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.583
Just 'cause she's sorta hot,

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.000
she thinks she can get away
with talking down to me!

00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:10.292
[grunting]

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.792
You want me
to hurry up, huh?

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:15.708
Okay, you got it.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.750
I can pick any one thing
to take with me, is that right?

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:19.667
Uh-huh!

00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:24.292
I pick you.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.625
[crunching]

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:34.500
Okay, stand in the magic circle
and don't step out--

00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:36.250
Hold on, what was it
you picked again?

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:37.750
-[whooshing, rumbling]
-Huh?

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.875
Your request has been heard.

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:47.625
And fear not, Lady Aqua,
for in your absence,

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.333
I shall tend to your duties.

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:50.500
Huh?

00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:51.708
[ANGEL]
Kazuma Satou's wish

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.500
complies with the regulations

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:54.875
and has been accepted.

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:56.958
Wait, you can't be serious.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.583
This is obviously
a mistake!

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.875
No, no, no! Re-do!
Cancel the request!

00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:03.250
You can't do this to me!
It's against the rules!

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:05.375
He can't take me with him,
I'm a goddess!

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:06.875
This is illegal!
It's totally illegal!

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:07.875
It's got to be illegal!

00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:08.750
Wait!

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:11.083
[crying] Wait!

00:09:11.125 --> 00:09:13.583
Have a safe journey,
Lady Aqua.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.083
Should you defeat
the Devil King,

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.208
I shall send an escort
to bring you back here.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.333
But I can't fight,
I'm a goddess!

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.750
The only skill
I have is healing!

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.333
I'm a healer,
not a fighter!

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:23.667
I can't defeat
the Devil King,

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:26.000
I can't defeat anyone!
[gasps]

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:27.875
No, put me down,
put me down!

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.417
-[KAZUMA chuckles]
-Huh?

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.125
It must suck
to be you right now,

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:34.208
getting dragged away by the guy
you were making fun of.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.458
[laughs]

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.292
You're coming with me,
and there's nothing

00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.792
you can do about it!

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.917
I'll tap your power
to live the good life!

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.083
And I'll tap it all day,
every day!

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.875
[screams]

00:09:45.917 --> 00:09:47.833
Please don't make me go
with a creep like him!

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.292
Please!

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.708
[KAZUMA cackling]

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:54.750
I wish you luck!

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:57.917
And I pray that of the many
candidates who have been sent,

00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.667
you shall be the hero
who defeats the Devil King!

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:02.917
If you can save that world
from his evil,

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958
the gods shall grant you
any wish your heart desires!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.375
Whoa! Seriously?!

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:09.458
Hold on a sec!
I'm supposed to say that!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.708
Now then,
begin your journey!

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.083
-Whoa! [cackling]
-No!

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.917

[reins crack]

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:42.417
Huh?

00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:44.917
No way!

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.833
-I'm really in another world!
-Hey, get back here, Goosie!

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.125
[KAZUMA]
I can't believe it!

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:51.417
So, like, does that mean
I get to learn magic

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.542
and, like, go
on real quests and stuff?

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:55.750
I get to be a hero?

00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:58.125
[crying]

00:10:58.167 --> 00:11:00.917
Goodbye to my miserable
hermit's life.

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.500
Hello to my new one!

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:04.958
This fantasy world's gonna
break me out of my shell!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.375
[crying]

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:07.667
What're you doing?

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:08.917
Would you stop already?

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.083
People are starting to stare,

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:11.375
and you're ruining my moment.

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.750
So, anyway,
now that we're here,

00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:15.333
aren't you supposed
to give me something?

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.750
I mean, look at me,
I'm still in a tracksuit!

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:19.792
I can't do what I gotta do
in a fantasy world

00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:21.417
wearing clothes like these.

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:23.167
Don't I get some
basic gear to start with?

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:25.625
-[wailing loudly]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.042

[wailing resumes]

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.542
Okay, quit spazzing out!

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.292
I get it,
you're mad you're here!

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:38.625
I'm sorry!

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:40.958
God, if you hate it so much,
just go back

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.917
to where you came from.

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.250
I can manage on my own.

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:45.000
Haven't you been
paying attention?

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:46.917
I can't go back,
that's the problem!

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.917
I'm stuck here with a creep!
What do I do?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.583
I'm stuck here,
and I don't know what to do!

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:52.625
[crying]

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:54.708
Calm down, Goddess.
Calm down.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.958
All we have to do
is find the guild.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.792
In most RPGs, that's usually
the place you gotta go

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:01.750
if a player's looking
to get some information.

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.792
Wow.
I didn't realize

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:05.250
a house-bound
gamer nerd like you

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.708
was capable
of having good ideas.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.500
Whatever, Goddess.
You coming?

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:10.458
Right behind you.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:13.583
By the way, I don't mind you
calling me "goddess,"

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.542
but I'm worried it'll cause
a commotion here.

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:16.708
Call me Aqua instead!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.417
Hey, wait.

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.583
Since you are a goddess
and all, you should know

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.500
where something like
an adventurer's guild is at.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.333
No, sorry, I don't.

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:25.750
I deal with tons of worlds.

00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:27.458
I can't know
every little detail about them.

for work,

Eee!

we just rolled
into town, buddy.

Been on the road a minute,
you know what I mean?

Truth is, I heard
y'all could use my help

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:21.500
fighting the Devil King.

-Hey.
-What?

00:13:36.125 --> 00:13:38.708
I noticed how you were talking
to that man back there.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.333
How did you know
how to do that?

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.583
-'Cause that's how it's done.
-Hm.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.792
Look, in RPGs,
you register with a guild

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:46.083
and find a place
to stay first.

00:13:47.542 --> 00:13:49.542
I-I don't know
anything about RPGs

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:51.000
but if that's what you say
we should do,

00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:52.208
then I'm all for it.

-Come on, let's go.
-Hey! Um...

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.958
You seem like such
an intelligent guy.

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:01.500
It's hard to believe
you were a nerd

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:03.875
with no friends
or girlfriends in life.

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:05.625
So, why'd you spend
every day indoors

00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:07.125
acting like a shut-in NEET?

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.917

are totally different,

I can help with that.

00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:21.875
Just pay the registration fee

00:14:21.917 --> 00:14:23.708
and I can get
your paperwork started.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.208
Oh, awesome!

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.958
Wait.
There's a registration fee?

-You got any money on you?
-Mm-mm.

00:14:30.542 --> 00:14:32.333
You dragged me here
without any warning,

to grab my purse.

If this was a game,

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:00.417
we'd at least get
some basic gear

00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:02.667
and enough cash
to cover us for a bit.

00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:04.125
How can they treat us
like this?!

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.417

it's my turn now.

Worshipped by the noble
religious order of Axis!

00:15:28.792 --> 00:15:30.708
The goddess Aqua!

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.250
If thou art one
of my loyal followers...

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.958
...I'd appreciate it
if you could lend me some money!

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.042
Actually, I'm in the Eris Sect.

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:41.542
-Uh!
-Uh.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.750
Ohh, you are?
Sorry to bother you.

Wait. Miss?

You say you're
with the Axis Sect?

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:52.750
According to the old stories,

00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:55.708
the goddess Aqua is senior
to the goddess Eris.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.292
I noticed earlier
you couldn't cover

00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:00.708
the registration fee,
so this must be fate.

-[coins clinking]
-Here.

Consider it a blessing
from the Lady Eris.

Although, you shouldn't
impersonate a goddess,

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.833
no matter how devoted
a follower you are.

00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:18.958
For some reason,
he didn't believe

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.875
I was really a goddess.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:22.458
Nice man, though!

He even pointed out
that Eris is my junior.

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:28.375
To think, one of my
subordinate's followers

00:16:28.417 --> 00:16:30.250
took pity on me...

00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:32.417
...and loaned me some money
when I asked.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:35.583
Yeah. Wow.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.083
Uh, uh...

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:44.667
So, uh, we have
the registration fee.

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:46.333
Oh. Okay.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:47.625
[KAZUMA]
She felt so bad,

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:50.583
she took the money
without even looking at us.

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:52.708
Allow me to explain
how all this works.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.708
Adventurer is
a generic class,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.000
and your skills
are important.

00:16:56.042 --> 00:16:59.125
Which brings us
to your registration card.

00:16:59.167 --> 00:17:00.542
It keeps track of your level

00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:02.500
based on all the monsters
you've killed.

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:05.042
When your level increases,
you'll earn points

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:07.375
you can trade in
to learn new skills.

00:17:07.417 --> 00:17:09.458
Work hard and you'll raise
your level in no time.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.333
On to the next step!

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:12.458
Would you please hold
your hand

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.417
over the crystal, sir?

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.542
Okay, here goes.

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:17.750
[energy pulsing]

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:18.875
[gasps]

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.833

[gears clicking]

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:32.667
[WOMAN] Once it's finished
the evaluation process,

00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:34.375
you'll get your current stats.

00:17:34.417 --> 00:17:37.833
Based on those, we'll know
which class suits you best.

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:39.375
[KAZUMA]
Sweet! I get to find out

00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:41.083
what all
my latent abilities are!

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.958
Everyone in the guild's
gonna freak out

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.917
over how rad I am!

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:50.333
Alright,
let's see your stats.

00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:53.375
"Kazuma Satou."
Interesting name.

00:17:53.417 --> 00:17:54.708
Ah, here we are!

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.583
Hmm, average across
the board.

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.458
Your intelligence is high,
that's good.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.500
Oh wow, your luck is way
above average.

00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:02.958
But, unfortunately,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.958
that's not an essential stat
for the adventurer class.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.167
With this much luck,

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:08.958
I'd recommend you be
a merchant instead

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.500
-or something like that.
-[AQUA snickering]

00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:14.708
She's trying to squash my dreams
of being an adventurer.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.292
Well, screw that!

00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:18.125
No offense, but...

00:18:18.167 --> 00:18:20.917
...I'd still like to be
an adventurer, please.

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.250
Don't look so sad!

00:18:22.292 --> 00:18:23.417
Once you start leveling up,

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.083
you can pick
something better!

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.792
Yeah? I sure hope so!

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:30.208
So much for being rad.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.000
[device whirring]

00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:33.458
[WOMAN]
Whoa!

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.375
Your intelligence
is below average.

00:18:35.417 --> 00:18:37.292
And your luck is the lowest
I've ever seen!

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:38.875
But even so,
the rest of your stats

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.875
are unbelievably high!

00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:43.750
Oh? So, does that mean
I'm unbelievably amazing?

00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:47.292
No. Amazing would be
an understatement!

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.167
The mage class
requires intelligence,

00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.792
so that's out
of the question.

00:18:50.833 --> 00:18:53.000
But other than that,
you can be anything you want!

00:18:53.042 --> 00:18:55.875
Crusader, sword master,
arch priest,

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:57.042
they're all advanced classes,

00:18:57.083 --> 00:18:58.500
and you can pick
any one of them!

00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:01.167
Well, it's a shame
there's no "goddess" class,

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:02.500
but what can you do.

00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:04.417
I shall settle for being
an arch-priest,

00:19:04.458 --> 00:19:05.708
who heals her allies!

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.125
I think that's
a wonderful choice!

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:09.667
It's a very versatile class,

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:12.000
with all types of healing
and support spells.

00:19:12.042 --> 00:19:14.000
One that's strong enough
to stand fearlessly

00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:15.417
on the frontlines!

00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.417
[PATRONS cheering]

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:24.542
I welcome you to our
adventurer's guild, Lady Aqua!

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.125
Best of luck to you.

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:28.167
We look forward
to your exploits.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:30.042
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:19:30.083 --> 00:19:31.667
[WOMAN] I never heard
of anyone starting

00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.792
as an arch-priest before!

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:35.958
A hard-ass chick
like you might actually have

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.667
a shot at beating
the Devil King!

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:41.750
This is such BS,
she stole my thunder.

00:19:41.792 --> 00:19:45.000
Kazuma! Today, we start
a life of adventuring!

00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:47.833
I thought you hated
the whole idea of it.

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:49.542
I like this part
of it, though.

00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:50.542
[KAZUMA sighs]

00:19:56.583 --> 00:19:58.458
[KAZUMA] Oh well.
Everything up to now's been

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.042
about creating
our characters, anyway.

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:04.833
Finally, our adventure
is about to start!

Goddammit!

00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:54.917
Have a bad dream?

00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.250
Oh man. Oh crap!

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.083
Uhh, what's wrong.

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:01.000
Do you need to go
to the bathroom again?

00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:02.667
I'll go with you,
if you're scared of the dark.

I am not! I just realized,

Sorry! We'll keep it down!

Man, we didn't come here
to be day laborers!

00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:18.625
You're right! No, we didn't!

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.500
Hurry up and defeat
the Devil King already,

00:22:20.542 --> 00:22:22.083
so I can go back home!

[KAZUMA] Her intelligence stat's
lower than the average human's.

Anyway, all the monsters
near town

00:22:35.292 --> 00:22:36.833
were killed off
a while ago.

00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:38.125
And with no monsters,

00:22:38.167 --> 00:22:40.083
no one was paying
for any fetch-quests.

00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:44.875
I get why, but it's all
too real world-y for me.

Oh, nothing.

That bath was great.

-Huh?

00:23:08.292 --> 00:23:10.167
I've been thinking
about stuff.

What do you say we leave town
and do a kill quest on our own?

[KAZUMA]
How, we're level one.

00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:16.708
We don't even have
any basic gear.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.625
It'll be fine!

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:18.667
As long I'm around,

00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:20.083
you have nothing
to worry about!

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.458
You can count on me!

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.542
That doesn't make me
feel better.

00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:28.458
[AQUA] Uh, have you forgotten
who I am?

Oh yeah, that's right!
You're a goddess!

Okay, you're on.

Great! This'll be fun!

[KAZUMA] And with that,
our adventure

in this new world
of ours began.
