WEBVTT

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:12.958
[KAZUMA]
There and... boom.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.792
[crackling]

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.000
Create Water!

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.542
[chuckles]

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:35.292
[gulping]

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.917
[sighs]

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, that's not bad
for a basic trick.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.333
Now that I got a skill,

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.375
I feel like more
of an adventurer!

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:44.625
[DARKNESS] Kazuma!
-Uh...

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.042
I had my armor repaired

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.500
with the bounty I received
from the cabbage harvest!

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.125
Does it not look brilliant?!

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.500
What do you think?

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.917
It looks like the kinda junk
a spoiled-ass son

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.500
of an aristocrat would wear.

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:57.833
Oh, honestly,
would it hurt you

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.250
to pay a lady a compliment
every now and again?

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.958
You're so rough.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500
You never show me any mercy.

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.792
Sorry, this other weirdo's
distracting me.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.625
If someone doesn't
stop her in a sec,

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.292
she's gonna out-perv you.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.833
I love you, Manatite staff,

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.125
with your throbbing
magical power!

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.292
[moaning]

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.917
[AQUA]
That's all?!

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.333
What are you trying
to pull here?!

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:20.625
I caught a ton of cabbages,

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.083
and that's all
you're offering?!

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.042
-Well, actually...
-Go on!

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.958
I checked your haul,
but I'm afraid

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.375
most of what you caught
was actually lettuce.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.208
Well, why is there lettuce
mixed in with all my cabbages!

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.083
True, lettuce does have
a low redemption value.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:36.792
You learn something new
every day, huh.

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:37.792
That's how hard!

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:39.375
[grunts]

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:41.917
[KAZUMA] And here she comes.
This should be fun.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.708
Oh, Kazuma!

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.875
[giggles]

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:47.625
How much did you get
from the last quest?

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:48.583
Do tell!

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:50.958
Oh, about a million.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[WOMEN gasp]

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.583
[KAZUMA]
It's true.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.958
Thanks to that "Cabbage Quest"
they sprung on us,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.292
I suddenly found myself rich.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.292
[ALL]
One million?!

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:36.625
[KAZUMA]
Yup, that's what I said.

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:38.375
I guess I snagged
a bunch of cabbages

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.542
with high XP.

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.500
Having high luck makes
a difference, yo!

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.750
[giggles]

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.500
Um, Kazuma,

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.333
I've been meaning
to tell you for a while,

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:50.667
but I think you're...

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.542
..."cool," yeah,
that's the word! "Cool"!

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.292
God, would you stop trying
to butter me up,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.042
just tell me what you want
and get it over with.

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:57.958
[whimpers]

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.750
I need some money!

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:01.875
I thought I'd get a bigger
reward after our quest,

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.458
but I didn't
and I owe those guys,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.833
but I don't have any money
and I don't know what to do!

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.625
I thought I'd be rich
by now,

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.833
so I racked up a bar tab
of a hundred thousand eris

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:10.958
and now I have to pay up!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.333
That ain't my problem!

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.792
You're the one who said
we should keep

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.958
our hauls separate
instead of combining them!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.208
But I only said that because

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.958
I thought I'd make
a killing off that quest!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.500
-You greedy bitch!
-Please, please,

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:21.708
please lend me some money!

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.917
I just need enough
to pay my tab!

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.250
The answer's no, got it?!

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:26.833
I'm sick of sleeping
in that stable,

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.208
so I'm gonna use my cash
to buy a place of my own!

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.083
A young man like you should have
a place of his own.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.417
But I'll miss hearing you
rustle around next to me,

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.083
breathing heavy,
moaning like you have

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.208
a stomachache and then--

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.000
Alright, I got it,
you win, you win!

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:41.000
I'll lend you the money,
just shut up!

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:42.750
[KAZUMA]
KonoSuba!

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:45.125
Kazuma, you are a true ally!

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.125
I'm so honored to be
in a party with you!

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.708
[giggling]

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.125
-Here you go, boys!
-Thanks, m'lady.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.250
-Mmm!
-[KAZUMA] Damn her!

00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:56.875
[cape flutters]

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.167
Kazuma looks like a real
adventurer now, don't you think?

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.625
Yeah, his tracksuit didn't go

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:07.458
with the fantasy world
vibe at all.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.500
What fantasy world?

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.292
I got a new magic skill.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.333
Sure it's basic,
but it's magic!

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.042
As for my outfit,
I call it

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:17.042
the "magical swordsman
without shield" look!

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.917
At least you don't look like
a creeper anymore.

00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.875
Let's take our new gear
on a kill quest!

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:24.958
We should pick one with lots
of small-fry monsters,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.667
so I can test out
the magic power

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:28.125
of my gorgeous new staff!

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:31.333
No, wait! We should go
after strong monsters!

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.125
Oh yes!
Massive and brutal!

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.125
No, we should all go on a quest
with a huge payout!

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.625
After paying my tab,
I need cash to buy a meal!

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.875
[KAZUMA]
They can't agree on anything!

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:42.292
Here's my two cents.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.250
It's mating season
for the Giant Toads, right?

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:46.125
Well, I heard there's a bunch
of them just outside of town.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.375
-No, not the frogs!
-No way, no frogs!

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:49.125
Hmm? Why not?

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:51.750
Well, they're still traumatized

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:53.458
after the last time
we fought 'em.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.042
Remember when we met,
I told you

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.917
they got swallowed
and covered in frog slime?

00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.167
[gasps]
I fail to see the problem!

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.542
How come?
Does that turn you on, too?

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:03.375
Of course not.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.167
[AQUA] [crying]
KonoSuba!

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.542
[KAZUMA] Aw, man! There's hardly
any good quests on the board!

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:11.500
[DARKNESS] Kazuma, look!
We should do that one!

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.333
It's a quest to kill
a horrific beast

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:14.333
called Black Fang!

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:16.208
[KAZUMA]
Oh, hell no!

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.750
What's going on around here?

00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:21.042
The only quests to choose from
are all super-hard.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:22.500
I am sorry about that.

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:23.417
[ALL]
Huh?

00:06:23.458 --> 00:06:24.708
Unfortunately, one of

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.333
the Devil King's top generals

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.542
took up residence
somewhere outside town.

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:30.000
-[KAZUMA] Huh?
- Because of that,

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:31.750
all the weaker monsters
in the area

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:33.292
have gone into hiding.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:35.792
So there won't be
an easy quest for a while.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.500
Crap.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:42.042
[AQUA] Honestly, I don't care
if he is a top general.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:44.667
If he's undead,
I could handle him easy!

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.000
I'll be damned if we're gonna
wait around here a month

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:48.583
till a bunch of knights
and badasses

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.167
come from the capital.

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.583
You know we're gonna run
out of money

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:53.333
before they get here.

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:56.167
Look at what I made!
Isn't it beautiful?

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:58.042
I think I could make
a fortune selling these!

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:02.292
[KAZUMA] Still waiting
to start my adventure here.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.250
I know you like
to practice every day,

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.875
but can't you go by yourself?

00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:15.042
If I did, I wouldn't have a ride
back after I fired my spell.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.125
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:07:16.167 --> 00:07:18.542
I can't move afterwards,
remember?

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:19.958
[KAZUMA]
Good point.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.583
[sighs] Dammit.

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.375
I don't wanna get stuck
babysitting her every day.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.333
Okay, get to practicing!

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:29.417
Hurry up and do your spell
and let's get back.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.917
I can't do it here!

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.667
I have to get
further away from town.

00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:34.833
Otherwise, the guards
will scold me again.

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:37.583
Hold on a sec.
What do you mean, "again"?

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.958
Have people been complaining
about the noise or something?

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.708
Mm-hmm.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.333
Further away it is.

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:47.458
[MEGUMIN]
KonoSuba!

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.167
Look. An abandoned castle.

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.333
[KAZUMA]
Uh, it's kinda spooky.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.000
[MEGUMIN] I know.
I'll use it for target practice!

00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:00.167
No one will complain
if I destroy that!

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.417
[KAZUMA]
I guess not.

00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:05.125
Oh, crimson blaze,
king of countless worlds.

00:08:05.167 --> 00:08:06.958
Though I promote
the laws of nature,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.167
I am also the alias
of destruction.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:12.583
The balance for all creation.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.958
Let the hammer of eternity
descend unto me!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.083
Explosion!

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.917
[explosion booms]

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.750
[rumbling]

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.125
[MEGUMIN groans]

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:33.250
Burn to ash
in crimson flame.

00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:34.458
[sighs]

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.458
That felt amazing!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
[KAZUMA]
Weirdo.

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:44.042
Anyway, I suddenly had
a daily routine.

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:46.875
[AQUA]
Get your cabbage here!

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.958
It's super-fresh
and dirt cheap!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.333
[KAZUMA]
Aqua was broke,

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:52.083
so she got herself
a part-time job.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.583
[chuckles]

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:55.833
[KAZUMA] And Darkness went back
to her family home

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.208
to go do some
weight training.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.250
Since Megumin didn't have
anything better to do,

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:03.208
she'd wanna go blast
that creepy castle every day...

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.708
-[MEGUMIN] Explosion!
-[KAZUMA] ...no matter what.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.208
[explosion booms]

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.958
We'd go on cold,
rainy evenings.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.167
[MEGUMIN]
...plosion!

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:12.458
[groans]

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.917
[KAZUMA]
And if it was sunny out,

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.292
we'd pack a lunch and go.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.625
[MEGUMIN]
...sion!

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:17.500
[groans]

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.750
[KAZUMA] And sometimes,
we'd go early in the morning,

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.667
and make a game of it!

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.292
-[MEGUMIN] ...sion!
-[explosion booms]

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.167
[rumbling]

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:27.167
[groans]

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:29.625
I'd give it a... six?

00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:31.042
Yesterday's was louder.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.958
[groans]

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.167
-[MEGUMIN] Explosion!
-[KAZUMA] Every dang day,

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:38.542
Megumin pounded
that poor castle with her magic.

00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:39.917
[explosion booms]

00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.083
[rumbling]

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.708
[KAZUMA] And the more
explosions I saw,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.292
the more I could tell
the difference...

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:45.458
[explosion booms]

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.792
...between an explosion
that was okay...

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:49.292
[explosion booms]

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.292
[KAZUMA] ...and one
that was awesome.

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:55.000
[tense breath]

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.250
Explosion!

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.583
[explosion booms]

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:07.750
[rumbling]

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.250
[groans]

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:11.875
Whoa! Today's was
the best one yet!

00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:13.667
The boom had
a nice snap to it,

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:16.250
and I could feel the rumble
way down in my bones.

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:18.708
I also liked how the shockwave
gently brushed my skin

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.625
instead of hitting me
like a freight train.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.875
Nice explosion!

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:25.750
[MEGUMIN] [strained voice]
Thank you, sir!

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.333
You finally understand
the path of explosions.

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.667
Well, then,
if you're interested,

00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:33.625
I can teach you
everything I know.

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:36.708
Hmm. I think I'll take
a raincheck for now,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.375
but I'd like to learn how
at some point in the future.

00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:41.167
[MEGUMIN]
You won't regret it.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:43.792
[BOTH laugh]

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.417
[sighs]
What future.

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.417
[cat meows]

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.167
-[AQUA] I'm back!
-Huh?

00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:53.458
Look at this food!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.542
There was a ton left over,

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.250
and they let me have it all.

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:57.833
Hope you're hungry!

00:10:57.875 --> 00:10:59.417
[humming]
Hey, Aqua,

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.125
I've been thinking
about stuff.

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:02.375
[AQUA]
Hmm? What?

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:04.125
[KAZUMA] About how impossible
it's gonna be

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:06.250
for you and me
to take down the Devil King.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.333
It's like I'm not some hero
in a fairy tale

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.167
with amazing powers
or anything.

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:14.833
I'm just a guy. We're way out
of our league here.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.292
The truth is, the only thing
that can beat the Devil King

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:19.333
is a group with powerful skills
and equipment,

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:20.667
-and that ain't us.
-[AQUA sobbing]

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:21.917
Stop it!

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.875
I'll never get home
if you think like that!

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:25.875
Oh please. You're supposed
to be a goddess,

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:28.208
but you haven't acted like one
since we got here!

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.750
You should've helped me
or at least sealed

00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:31.458
the Devil King
until I can face him.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.333
But no!
You'd rather cry!

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:35.542
All you're good for
are cheap-ass party tricks!

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.292
[crying]

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.875
Why don't you make
yourself useful

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:43.625
and come up with an easy way
to make some money.

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:44.958
I'm sick of this stable.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.417
And at some point,
it'd be great

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:47.833
if you could teach me
how to heal.

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.625
That's the only thing
you got going for you.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.958
[AQUA]
No!

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.750
Anything but my healing magic!

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.500
There'd be no point
in having me around then!

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:59.667
Aren't I enough?!
Don't you need me?!

00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:01.333
-[crying]
[KAZUMA/MEGUMIN sigh]

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:04.458
It looks like you've taken
your scolding to the next level.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.667
Instead of unloading
on her like that,

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:08.417
you should try
to be more tactful.

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:11.583
Mm. Everyone needs
to vent some time.

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.042
If ever you feel
stressed again,

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:14.167
feel free to tear into me!

00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:15.667
I wouldn't mind!

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:17.708
-Uh...
-[crying]

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.583
-You're so cruel!
-[KAZUMA] That faker!

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:23.125
Emergency! Emergency!

00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:26.417
We need all adventurers
to arm themselves immediately!

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.750
Make your way
to the main gate

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.583
and prepare yourselves
for battle!

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:35.750
My god!
We're in for it now!

00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:38.750
[lightning cracks]

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:43.792
What's this about?

00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:45.042
What, are you blind?!

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:46.708
There's a nightmare
standing there!

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:50.583
I am one of
the Devil King's generals.

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:54.375
And I have been stationed
of late at a nearby castle.

00:12:54.417 --> 00:12:55.917
Is that a Dullahan?

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:56.875
[gasps]

00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:00.458
Every day,
every single day,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.125
every bloody damn day,

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:04.125
one of you maniacs
comes to my home

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:06.125
and hurls
Explosion spells at it!

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:09.583
And I demand to know
who it is!

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.625

[KAZUMA]
Oh goody.

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:16.167
We managed to piss off

00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:18.333
one of
the Devil King's generals.

00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:23.708
[lightning cracks]

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.875
Every day,
every single day,

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:27.458
every bloody damn day,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.375
one of you maniacs hurls
Explosion spells at my home!

00:13:30.417 --> 00:13:32.917
And I demand to know
who it is!

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.500
-[horse neighs]
-[lightning cracks]

00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:37.583
Explosion spells?

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:40.333
Who uses Explosion spells
around here?

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.625
[ADVENTURER]
Yeah, who?

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:44.458
Gah!

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.417

Uhh. H-hold on!

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:53.667
Why is everyone looking at me?
I can't use Explosion magic!

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.333
I-I only just started
casting spells!

00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:57.833
Please, you have to believe me!

00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:58.833
I didn't do it!

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:00.208
I don't wanna die!

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.125
What'll happen
to my little brothers?!

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:03.792
Who'll take care of them?!

00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:06.458
Megumin?

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.958
[DULLAHAN]
You?

00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:22.958
[grunts]

00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:26.125
You are the imbecile
who's been blasting

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:28.958
my castle day
after day after day?!

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.208
If you know who I am
and wish to pick a fight,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.458
then have the decency
to announce yourself properly

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.792
before you attack!

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.083
Otherwise, keep well away

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.917
from my home, understand?!

00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.292
Honestly, this harassment

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.083
is completely unwarranted!

00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:42.292
I spared your town

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:43.917
thinking it wasn't
worth my time!

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.250
And how do you repay me?

00:14:45.292 --> 00:14:48.750
With a boom, boom, boom,
every single goddam day!

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:50.583
You must be out
of your flipping mind,

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:51.958
you little wench!

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.458
I am Megumin!

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.083
I am an arch-wizard!

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.542
One who commands
Explosion magic!

00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:02.917
[DULLAHAN]
What is a "Megumin"?

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.208
Are you pulling my leg?!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.292
[MEGUMIN]
N-no!

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.708
I am of
the Crimson Demon Clan

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.375
and the greatest mage
in this whole town!

00:15:10.417 --> 00:15:13.417
Yes, I knew you were one
of the Devil King's generals!

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:16.583
That's why I used Explosions
as a strategy to flush you out.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.292
It seems my plan worked
and you've come alone,

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:21.583
like a fool.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.500
[ALL gasp]

00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:26.250
I'm not buying
her strategy story.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.458
Her claim of being
the greatest mage here

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.083
is also quite dubious.

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:33.458
Shh! Keep your voices down,
she's on a roll!

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.000
She hasn't used her
Explosion spell yet today.

00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.625
And with everyone
backing her up,

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:39.792
he'll think twice
before doing anything.

00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:42.542
The best part's coming up,
so keep quiet and watch!

00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.083
[DULLAHAN] [scoffs]
Very well.

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:49.000
I did not come here
to meddle with novices, anyway.

00:15:50.292 --> 00:15:53.833
I shall be staying
at that castle indefinitely.

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:56.917
Do not use your spell
on it ever again.

00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.500
Understood?

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:01.167
No! A Crimson Demon
must use Explosion

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:03.125
once a day,
or we'll die.

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:06.125
Wh-what?!
I never heard that before!

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:08.125
-[AQUA giggles]
-You just made that up!

00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:12.208
I take it you intend to continue
bombarding my castle, then?

00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:14.375
Mm-hmm.

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:16.792
[DULLAHAN]
I may be evil now,

00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:18.917
but I was a knight once.

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.417
Killing the weak
never appealed to me,

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.125
till now.

00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:24.417
[chuckles]

00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:25.917
You, sir,
should have run away

00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.375
when you had the chance.

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:29.875
M'lady!
Your assistance, please!

00:16:29.917 --> 00:16:31.375
[gasps]

00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:33.417
-Now what?
-I go to work, that's what.

00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:34.292
Huh?!

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:35.375
I don't care if you are

00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:36.875
the Devil King's general!

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:38.708
It was foolish to move
to this territory

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.042
while I'm living here!

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.417
Because of you,
I haven't had

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:43.125
any decent quests to go on!

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:45.375
And now I'm about
to correct that!

00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:48.000
Well,
what do we have here?

00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:50.083
An arch-priest?

00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:53.292
I am one of
the Devil King's top generals.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.250
And I can withstand
whatever spells

00:16:55.292 --> 00:16:59.250
a low-level priest
from this town can conjure.

00:16:59.292 --> 00:17:00.458
I know,

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.083
what say I make
that Crimson Demon whelp

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:04.167
suffer a bit?

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:05.375
[gasps]

00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:10.708
Not if I purify you
with my prayer first!

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.000
[DULLAHAN]
You're too late!

00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:16.750
I sentence thee to death.

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:20.625
In one week,
you shall die.

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:24.125
[DARKNESS grunting, screaming]

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.875
No! Darkness!

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.708
[grunting]

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.333
Dammit, he put
a death curse on her!

00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:33.750
D-Darkness! Darkness!

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:34.958
Are you alright?!

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:39.375
[groans] It does not seem
to be serious.

00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:41.250
[DULLAHAN] This unexpected
turn of events

00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:43.458
might actually be
more preferable,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.167
seeing as how close
the bonds are between you.

00:17:46.208 --> 00:17:49.375
In one week,
you Crimson Demon child,

00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:51.583
your crusader will die.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:53.375
[chuckles]
Till then,

00:17:53.417 --> 00:17:55.667
she will suffer
as she trembles in terror

00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:58.125
of her impending doom.

00:17:58.167 --> 00:18:00.750
And it is all your fault!

00:18:00.792 --> 00:18:02.000
[gasps]

00:18:02.042 --> 00:18:03.458
Yes.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.208
Watch her suffer
for the next seven days

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.750
and boil in the hell
of your guilt!

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:09.667
[chuckles]

00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:10.875
This would not have happened

00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:13.042
had you accepted my offer.

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:17.125
[DARKNESS grunts]

00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:19.417
[DARKNESS] You fiend.
You have chained

00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:21.833
this diabolical
death curse to me.

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:25.667
And the only way to remove it
is to submit to your whims!

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:28.333
You wish to defile me,
don't you?!

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:29.708
What?

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.708
Uh, what in the hell
is she talking about?

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:37.125
I will not allow a mere curse
to break my spirit!

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.708
I cannot give in but--

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.458
-Wh-what shall I do, Kazuma?!
-[KAZUMA] How should I know?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.708
[DARKNESS] I can feel
his filthy eyes on me.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.708
Hungry! Wanting!

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.500
They are the eyes
of a degenerate,

00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:49.708
one who would make
a sex slave of me!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.167
And to break this foul curse,

00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:52.625
I shall have
to submit my body

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:54.833
to all manner
of pornographic acts!

00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:56.333
Over and over again!

00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:58.333
[panting]

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:01.583
You may dominate my body
if you wish...

00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:04.083
...but you will not dominate
my heart!

00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:05.583
Can you imagine it?!

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.042
A female knight in chains,

00:19:07.083 --> 00:19:09.542
made the plaything
of the Devil King's minion!

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.000
Oh, the horror!

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:12.667
-What should I do, Kazuma!
-[KAZUMA] Still don't know.

00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:15.500
Who could have expected things
to become so risqué!

00:19:15.542 --> 00:19:19.125
I do not want to go,
but... I have no choice!

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.083
I shall resist
as long as I can!

00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:22.458
Do not try to save me!

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.958
I shall return some day!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.250
You madwoman!

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.375
[KAZUMA]
You're not going anywhere!

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:29.333
And quit freakin' out

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:31.083
the Dullahan already!

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:33.375
[DARKNESS]
You mustn't stop me! Let me go!

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:35.208
-I have to go!
-[KAZUMA] So pathetic.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.500
[DARKNESS]
KonoSuba!

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:40.708
A-anyway, no more
blowing up my home!

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.708
And as for you,
Crimson Demon girl,

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.042
if you wish to lift my curse
on your comrade,

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.000
come to my castle.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:50.833
If you make it past my
undead knights to my chamber,

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:52.875
I shall spare her

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:55.375
But I promise you,
it will be very,

00:19:55.417 --> 00:19:57.875
very difficult.

00:19:57.917 --> 00:20:00.958
[sinister laughter]

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.708
Uh...

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:14.583
Hmm.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.917
[KAZUMA]
Hey, where you going?

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:21.833
I'm going to the castle,

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:24.292
give that Dullahan a dose
of my Explosion spell

00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:27.292
right in his face and lift
the curse from Darkness.

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.417
[nervous giggle]

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:31.375
[sighs]

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:33.750
[chuckles]

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:36.167
Well, I ain't
letting you go alone!

00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:39.125
I don't want you wasting
your spell on one of his guards.

00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:40.917
That'll be the end of you.

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.000
Besides, I was there
with you all those times

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:44.292
you blew up the castle.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:46.250
I should have known
it belonged to someone.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.042
F-fine. If you insist.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.208
Although you heard
what he said

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.833
about the undead knights there.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:57.625
Conventional weapons
won't affect them.

00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:00.375
The only thing we have
that would is magic.

00:21:00.417 --> 00:21:01.458
My magic.

00:21:03.792 --> 00:21:06.750
For once, you will have
to totally rely on me!

-[DARKNESS] No.
-[MEGUMIN] Uh--

Do not risk your lives for me.
It is too dangerous!

Don't worry about it!

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.292
We'll figure something out
and lift that curse off you.

00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:18.417
We ain't gonna let some old--

Huh?

00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:45.125
[AQUA] For me, lifting some
old Dullahan's curse

00:21:45.167 --> 00:21:46.333
is child's play!

00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:47.417
See?

00:21:47.458 --> 00:21:49.000
I can be awfully priest-ish

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:50.083
when I get the chance!

our bubble, Aqua.

This is Aqua, the goddess,

with my progress report.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:50.333
We ran into a teeny bit
of trouble,

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.542
but other than that,
things are going fine.

In fact, it's--
