WEBVTT

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.875
My name is Darkness.

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:14.458
And my class is crusader.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.833
If you would have me...

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.875
...I would like to join
your p-p-p-party, please.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.375
I can start immediately.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:25.625
Mmm, I don't--

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.500
Tell me about the women
in your party.

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:29.875
Why are they all slimy?!

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:31.792
What sort of horror
befell those two?!

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.833
Oh, they, uh,
they just got swallowed

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.167
by a couple
of Giant Toads during--

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.458
What?!

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.125
Oh, if only I were there.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.417
[KAZUMA] [gulps]
What's up with this chick?

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.708
I-I mean, a-as a knight,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.125
I cannot stand by
and watch

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:48.208
two tender young ladies
be defiled by some creature.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.417
[KAZUMA]
Whoa, red flag.

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:52.250
She's givin' me
the crazy-eye big time.

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:54.750
My gut tells me she's like
Aqua and Megumin,

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.958
hopeless with a capital "H."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.042
Yeah, I don't recommend
joining us.

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.708
One of our members isn't what
I'd call all that useful.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.000
And the other? She can only use
her magic once a day.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.667
And I got no skills.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.000
Sorry to say this,
but our party's trash.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.167
So you'd be better--
Oww!

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.875
That is exactly
what I am looking for.

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:14.250
In all honesty,

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:16.583
I have
a slight confession to make.

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:20.167
Although I am confident
in my defensive abilities,

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.292
I am quite clumsy.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.417
In fact,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:25.667
none of my attacks
ever hit their mark.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.208
[KAZUMA]
Well, there you have it.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.833
My gut was right.

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.500
That said, I will not hesitate
to charge the frontline.

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:34.750
You can use me as your shield.
Yes! Use me!

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.708
-[KAZUMA] Gyah. Too close!
-[thumping]

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.000
Being a shut-in
never trained me

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.083
for face-to-face situations
like this.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.208
No. It's my adolescent
virgin hormones.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.000
They're being overloaded
by her hotness.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.792
Don't let her seduce you.
Stay calm.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:49.792
Sorry.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.667
I could never use a woman
as a shield.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.292
I wouldn't mind that.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.000
Yeah, well, we get eaten
by monsters in every battle.

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:58.625
Oh, I wouldn't mind that either.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:01:59.792
Huh?

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.875
I was right.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:05.792
This girl is hopeless,
just like the other two.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.208
Oh, brother.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.417
I can't believe I slept in
till noon.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.750
-[AQUA] Ta-da!
-Uh--

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:50.042
[PATRONS gasping, cheering]

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:51.792
-Sprout.
-[PATRONS] Yeah.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.667
[cheering]

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.500
[AQUA] Thank you.
Oh, you're too kind.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
Oh. Kazuma, look!

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:03.667
Don't you just love
the new skill I acquired?!

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:07.042
It's a great addition to my
already awesome set of powers.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.542
[KAZUMA] That's just
a party-trick, dork.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.792
[AQUA]
KonoSuba!

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.292
[KAZUMA]
I have no idea

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.292
how to cash my points in
for new skills.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.250
I wanna try,
but I don't wanna get a skill

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.417
that's lame, you know.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:22.542
Hmm?

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.750
First, you have to find someone
with a skill you want

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.583
to teach you how to use it.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.208
After they do, the skill
will appear on your card.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.542
Then, to finish learning it,

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.583
just transfer your points
over to the skill.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.583
So, like,
if I had enough points

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.167
and wanted to learn
Explosion magic,

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:41.125
all I have to do is ask
and you'd teach me?

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:44.083
Yes, exactly! That's all
you'd have to do, Kazuma!

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.833
If you want to learn
Explosion magic,

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.667
I can teach you
as much as you want!

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.708
When you think about it,
is there any other skill

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.125
that's more worthwhile
to know?

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.875
No, there most definitely
is not.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.417
Just say the word
and we shall walk

00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.833
the path
of explosions together!

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.792
[KAZUMA]
Way too close for comfort.

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:03.000
Easy, kiddo.
Don't get so riled up.

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:04.583
I've only got
three points anyway,

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.708
so it's not like you--

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.125
He said "kiddo."

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.208
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.125
Heh. He called me "kiddo."

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:22.125
[sighs]

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.417
[KAZUMA] I gotta find
a quick and easy skill.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.500
Something cool.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:28.375
One that don't cost
too much points.

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:29.625
-[DARKNESS] Here you are.
-Uh...

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.375
Holy crap!

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.750
[DARKNESS]
We could not finish our talk,

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:37.875
because you said you were drunk
and felt ill.

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.917
Uh, I'm feeling better now.

00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.292
I was trying
to let her down easy.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:45.417
Can't she take a hint?
What do I do?!

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.500
Glad to hear.

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:47.625
Now, shall we continue

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.042
where we left off?

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:50.667
I would like to join
your party, if--

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:52.250
You can't and that's final.

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:54.667
[gasps, whimpers]

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:56.958
So fast. Cruel.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.083
[KAZUMA]
Is she enjoying this? Eww.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.583
[GIRL laughing]

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.417
That's not how
you do it, Darkness.

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:05.708
You'll scare people away
if you're that pushy.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.958
Um, who are you?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.958
[giggles]

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.208
My name is Chris.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.000
As you can see,
I'm a thief.

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:12.833
I'm also friends
with this poor thing.

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.292
[KAZUMA]
Oh, finally.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.958
A girl who seems like
she's got her head on straight.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.500
Just now,
I heard you talk

00:06:18.542 --> 00:06:20.083
about wanting
to learn a skill.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.083
Well, how would you like
to learn some thieving?

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.292
Huh?

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.375
Thief skills always come
in handy here.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.667
Plus, it doesn't take all
that many points to learn.

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:29.250
-[KAZUMA] Seriously?
-Seriously.

00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:31.500
Just buy me a drink
and I'll be happy to teach you.

00:06:31.542 --> 00:06:32.750
That's it?!

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.917
Alright, count me in!

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.917
Barkeep, can I get
an ice-cold drink

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:37.875
for the lady here?!

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.375
[CHRIS]
KonoSuba.

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:48.000
Okay so, there are all kinds
of thief skills,

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:50.292
like "Enemy Detection"
and "Lurk."

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.500
But I'll show you
my personal favorite.

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:54.708
Watch close. Ready?

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.958
Yup. Ready when you are.
Show me what you got!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Steal.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:02.042
-[energy pulsing]
-[grunts]

00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:08.875
[coins clinking]

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:10.583
Hey. My coin pouch.

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:13.125
That right there's
a skill called "Steal."

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.667
It nabs one random item,

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:16.583
and the higher your Luck,
the better the score.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:19.292
Anyway, that is how
you use Steal.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:20.292
Huh.

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:25.125
What say you and I
have a contest?

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.542
I stole from you,
now you steal from me.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.875
Whatever you get,
you keep. Deal?

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.542
Do not ask him to risk
his money like that.

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.292
Well, he is an adventurer.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:37.042
Taking a risk or two
comes with the territory.

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:38.333
Hmm.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.333
I could lose all
the cash I have.

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:43.875
Still, getting to have
a duel of skills

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:45.250
like this with someone?!

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:47.000
That's what I'm talking about!

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:50.750
Finally, I get to do something
adventure-y in this world!

00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.208
Sure, I'm in.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.708
Alrighty, then.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.750
Have a look at your card
and you'll see a section there

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.458
labeled "skills."

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.792
You'll see the stuff
I taught you

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.167
and the points it takes
to learn 'em.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.333
Enemy Detection: one point.

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.292
And Lurk: one point.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.375
And Pilfer: one point.

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:11.167
And Nature's Beauty--
"Nature's Beauty?"

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.500
Oh, that.

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:14.625
Earlier in the bar,
your ally was performing

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:15.958
a party trick skill?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.292
That is its name.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.917
It says it costs
five points to learn.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.208
For that?!
No, thank you.

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:28.292
[angelic music playing]

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:37.917
[crackling]

00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:44.333
That's it. Done.

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:46.667
All the skills you picked
are yours now.

00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:47.750
Come at me, thief.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:49.375
You got it.

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:51.500
Don't cry
if I steal something you like.

She taught Kazuma some
of her thief skills just now.

He used them on her,
stole her panties,

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.208
and then took all the money
she had as ransom.

Would you please let me
handle this?!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.792
I said I'd give him back
his coin pouch,

but he said
that wasn't enough.

my panties back.

I mean, yeah, that's pretty much
what happened, but still.

[CHRIS] Then, he said
if he didn't like the amount,

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:44.333
he'd have
my panties framed and,

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:46.917
and hung on his wall
like a trophy.

You're gonna get me killed.

Did your stats and level
go up or something?

a lady knight like you,

do you know
what he's gonna do?

he'll chain you up

and torture the hell
out of you!

Yes. I fully expect
he would.

For you see,
since days of old,

00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:03.750
becoming his erotic plaything
has been a female knight's duty.

00:16:17.167 --> 00:16:19.000
-[DARKNESS] Kazuma.
-Hmm?

00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:20.458
Here is my chance.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.833
I will show you my skill
as a crusader

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.333
and prove my worth!

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:30.083
[DARKNESS yelling]

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.750
She can't hit
a single one of em.

00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:44.083
[MAN screams]

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:47.583
Ah!

00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:49.542
-[MAN grunts]
-Whoa!

00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:52.125
[grunting]

00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:53.500
Look out!

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.000
[thud]

00:16:57.042 --> 00:16:57.958
Huh?

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.708
[cabbages thudding]

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.750
[DARKNESS grunts]

00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:08.500
Retreat to safety.
I have this.

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:09.375
[grunting]

00:17:09.417 --> 00:17:10.625
Darkness!

00:17:17.042 --> 00:17:18.125
[DARKNESS]
Oh no!

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:20.417
Her armor!

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958
[ADVENTURER]
Forget about us, milady!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.125
Save yourself!

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:26.917
[DARKNESS]
I will not!

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.250
[MEN]
Whoa.

00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:30.250
Oh man. She can't take--

00:17:31.458 --> 00:17:34.167
I cannot abandon
my comrades in battle.

00:17:34.208 --> 00:17:37.333
[grunts] I can't. I won't!

00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:40.083
Wow. Now that's a knight.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.542
Run away, milady. Run.

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:43.625
[DARKNESS gasps]

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.625
[ALL gasp]

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.125
[DARKNESS]
They're watching me.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.125
[ALL]
Oh!

00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:54.292
[DARKNESS] Rough, uncouth men
are looking at my bare skin

00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:56.333
and getting aroused.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.125
It's shameful.

00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.583
F-filthy.

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:01.625
Glorious!

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:03.000
[KAZUMA]
She's getting off on it.

00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:06.083
She's sacrificing her body
to protect those men!

00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:08.458
We knights should learn
from her example.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.250
No, she's just freaky!

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:12.875
-[cape fluttering]
-Quake in fear, cabbages.

00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:16.750
For no one can stand against
my lethal Explosion spell.

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:18.667
That one's freaky, too.

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:22.208
[MEGUMIN giggles]

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.958
When I'm faced with such
a massive army of foes,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
how can I resist the sweet,
sweet urge to unleash Explosion?

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.458
-I cannot!
-Yeah, you can.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.083
[MEGUMIN]
Darkness shrouded in light.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.542
Frenzied blaze clad in night...

00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:40.083
In my clan's name,
reveal the fall of thine origin.

00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:42.083
I summon the root
of thy power,

00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:44.917
a power so fearsome
it lies hidden

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.083
in the kingdom of ash.

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:49.000
Explosion!

00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:56.083
[ALL gasp]

00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:58.375
[screaming]

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:01.833
[explosion booms]

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:04.333
[ALL screaming]

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:09.833
[screaming]

00:19:14.208 --> 00:19:15.625
[WAITRESS]
There's plenty of cabbage

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:17.167
to go around, so eat up!

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:19.167
[KAZUMA]
I can't believe it.

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:20.917
[crunching]

00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:25.292
How can a simple cabbage
stir-fry be so damn tasty?

00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:27.083
Wait, I didn't come
to a fantasy world

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.667
to fight cabbages.

00:19:28.708 --> 00:19:31.792
Well, there's no doubt
that you're a crusader.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:33.792
Even without your armor,
you're so fierce

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:35.417
those cabbages
couldn't get past you.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.458
Well, actually,
I'm just built solidly.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.417
Protecting someone with my body
is all I'm good for.

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.750
Aqua, your Nature's Beauty spell
was perfect.

00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:48.000
The cold water quenched

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.458
everyone's thirst
on the battlefield

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.875
and kept all the cabbages
fresh in the cages.

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:55.000
Nature's Beauty!

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:56.542
Nature's Beauty!

00:19:57.792 --> 00:19:59.292
[AQUA]
Oh, it was nothing.

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.000
That's why having an arch-priest
around is important.

00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:01.958
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.083
For what, squirting water?

00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:07.083
Well, an arch-priest's
magical water is the purest.

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:08.083
-Really?
-Your spell

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.375
was astounding,
Megumin.

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:10.542
-Really?
-You wiped out

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.875
an entire swarm
of cabbage in one blow.

00:20:12.917 --> 00:20:15.042
-Really?
-That's Crimson Demon power.

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.333
-Breathtaking, isn't it?
-Yes.

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:19.833
I've never been hit
by such firepower before.

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:21.708
Don't go makin'
a habit of it.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.708
[giggles]

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.708
[laughs]

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.708
[laughs]

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.000
[sighs]

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.583
By the way, Kazuma.

00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:33.292
You were pretty amazing
out there yourself.

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.625
I agree.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.667
When you turned invisible
with your Lurk skill

00:20:36.708 --> 00:20:39.000
and attacked the enemy
from behind with Steal,

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:41.542
it was handled with
the precision of an assassin.

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.292
Truly impressive.

00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:45.958
Kazuma,
by the holy name of me,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.583
I hereby bestow upon you

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:49.375
the title
of "Great Cabbage Thief."

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.000
God, put a sock in it.

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:53.708
Oh, what did I ever do
to deserve this life?!

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.125
Yes, well, now you all know
what I am capable of.

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:59.208
As crusader and ally.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.833
So, once again,

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:02.458
I am Darkness.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.708
Even though I wield
a two-handed sword,

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.292
please do not expect
too much of me.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.792
I'm far too clumsy and my
attacks rarely hit their mark.

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:13.375
However, I make
an impenetrable wall.

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:16.583
Our party is turning out to have
quite the impressive roster,

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:17.458
don't you think?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.625
First, we have me,
an arch-priest.

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:22.333
Then Megumin,
an arch-wizard.

00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:24.125
And now Darkness,
a crusader.

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:27.042
There aren't many parties
where three out of four

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:28.542
of the members
are advanced classes.

00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:31.042
[groans, then sighs]

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.917
[KAZUMA]
If she was, you know, normal,

00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:35.792
I wouldn't have a problem
with her joining.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:38.958
I mean, she's so hot.
Still...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.583
Huh? Well, Kazuma,
now that we are allies,

00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:44.792
do not hesitate to use me
as your shield.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.042
[KAZUMA] ...she's kinky.
A real-life masochist.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.458
To some folks out there,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.167
I bet this looks like
the perfect set-up.

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:56.333
But from where I'm sitting,
it's a recipe for disaster.

00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:58.250
If I fail to live up
to my duties,

00:21:58.292 --> 00:22:00.500
feel free
to reprimand me harshly.

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:03.208
Abandon me to the clutches
of your enemies, if you wish.

00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:07.292
I-I would not mind
their clutches at all.

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.292
Oh.

00:22:10.542 --> 00:22:13.208
Good sir, I look forward
to working with you.

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:46.375
[KAZUMA]
To my teacher.

00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:49.250
I'm learning all kinds of things
in this parallel world I'm in.

00:23:49.292 --> 00:23:52.458
Like how its society works,
what being human is,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.833
and what it means to be ali--
