00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:18.375
Where am I?

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:22.917
[sighs]

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.042
Oh crap.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.917
I died again.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:04.792
[KAZUMA]
After our battle with Verdia,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:08.292
the Devil King's General,
the season changed to winter.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.458
On this particular day,
I was in a mood

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.542
that was not so good.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.208
I need money!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.792
Well, duh.
Everyone here needs money.

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:20.500
Money makes life easier.

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.750
If you had ambition,
things would be different.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.292
I mean, here I am,
a goddess,

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.500
and you have no problem
letting me sleep in a stable!

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.375
That's both shameful
and disrespectful.

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:32.875
Straighten up and give me
the life I deserve already!

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.125
Spoil me with luxury,
darn it!

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:37.833
Look, lady, you have
any freakin' idea

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.500
what I need money for?

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:40.500
No.

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:42.250
To pay off all our debt!

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:43.375
Uhh!

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:45.250
Thanks to all the damage
you caused,

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:46.125
yeah, you!

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:47.250
Damn near all the cash we get

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.708
from quests gets wiped out!

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.417
Why? To pay the bill
for damage you caused!

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:53.917
You wanna talk
about sleeping in stables?

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.292
When I woke up this morning
on my pile of straw,

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.125
my eyelashes were frozen!

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.208
You want luxury?!
I wanna get out of there

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.167
so I don't freeze to death!

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:03.125
[sneezes]

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.292
What was I supposed to do?!

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:08.667
If I didn't use
my super-incredible powers

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.083
to get rid of Verdia,

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.458
there wouldn't be a town left
to freeze to death in!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.583
I should be worshipped,
not scolded!

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.208
Everyone should be singing
my praises

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.708
and spoiling me rotten!

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.625
Alright, you attention-whore!

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.375
I'll admit you saved the day.

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.042
So here's what we're gonna do.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.167
You can have all the praise,
all the reward,

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.667
and all the debt!

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:28.625
Have fun
payin' it off yourself.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.083
[yelps]
No! Wait! I'm sorry!

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:33.125
I-I didn't mean
to say those things!

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.208
Don't leave me like this!

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.375
[DARKNESS] It is far too early
in the morning for this.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.958
Did you find us
a good quest to go on?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.792
Uh-uh. There didn't seem
to be any rush to.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:45.333
Everyone here's just
chillin' out.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.083
[PATRONS laughing, chattering]

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.667
So, what do you wanna
do today?

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:51.000
[MAN] Go back to the inn
and sleep. It's cold out!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.125
[MEGUMIN] I see.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.708
After the battle with Verdia,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.125
every adventurer who took part
got a piece of the reward.

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:00.958
Their coin pouches are full now,
so they have no reason

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.042
to go fight the more dangerous
winter monsters.

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:06.917
This is perfect!
Now, we can pick a good quest.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.125
Y-Yes, let's!

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:10.292
Hopefully, one
with a strong enemy.

[KAZUMA]
I see some good rewards,

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.542
but all these quests suck.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.333
-Kazuma! Kazuma!
-[KAZUMA] That's my name.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.250
[DARKNESS]
How about this one?!

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:26.875
They are offering
one million eris

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.083
to hunt a pack
of White Wolves!

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.750
I can already imagine
the thrill of wild beasts

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.958
clawing and slobbering on me.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.958
Mmm!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.333
[KAZUMA]
Nope.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.208
-Kazuma! Kazuma!
-Still my name.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.875

about this one?

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:43.042
-Huh?
-A One-Shot Bear kill-quest!

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:45.292
I'll teach that old bear

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:46.250
which one of us has

00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:47.875
the stronger
one-shot attack!

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.333
Nothing can survive
my Explosion spell!

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:51.833
Are you kidding!
With a name like that,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.708
you know it means business.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.542
Hell, I bet one sneeze
from it is enough to kill us.

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:57.667
Ohh!

00:04:57.708 --> 00:04:59.333
[KAZUMA]
Hmm, "Destroyer,

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:01.250
"the mobile fortress,

and determine route."

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:05.792
This might work.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.208
I don't know
what a Destroyer is, though.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.875
Not "a" Destroyer,
"the" Destroyer.

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:13.208
It is a fast-moving,
giant fortress.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.208
It walks around
on huge legs,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.542
crushing everything.

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.042
It's also weirdly popular
with children!

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:21.625
[KAZUMA]
Ooh! Yeah, I don't get it.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:25.083

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Hey, guys, what are these
Snow Sprites?

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:32.500
They're offering
a hundred thousand eris

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:33.667
for each one killed.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.875
But going by their name,

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.500
they sound kinda dorky.

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.125
They tend to roam
in large groups

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:39.542
on the snowy plains.

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.833
People say that
with each Snow Sprite you kill,

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.417
spring comes
a half a day sooner.

that one, then!

Why does a masochist that
likes fighting strong monsters

look so happy about this?

I didn't-- Ugh!

What's up with you
and that net?!

You look like some dumb kid
hunting bugs in the snow.

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:23.333
I'm going to use this
to catch Sprites.

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.000
Then, pop em
into these bottles.

00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:26.833
I thought, since they're cold,

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.875
we could put em in a box
with our drinks

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.542
[hissing]

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:51.958
Wh-what is that?!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.958
How thrilling!

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.875
Is she playing dead?

00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:58.083
-[AQUA] Kazuma!
-Huh?

00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:00.208
There's a reason
adventurers don't go

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.708
on quests in winter.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.333
And it's not because
of the cold.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:04.333
Why?

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.333
[AQUA]
You used to live in Japan,

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:08.875
so I'm pretty sure
you've heard his name

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:10.375
mentioned
in your weather forecasts

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.917
this time of the year.

00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.250
He is the lord
of the Snow Sprites,

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:16.917
the very image
of a brutal winter.

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:17.833
[gulps]

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.875
That's right!

00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:21.708
The Winter Shogun is here!

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:25.292
-Uh?
-[DARKNESS] Hah!

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:27.542
Th-the Winter Shogun!

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:29.292
He is one of the monsters
the kingdom put

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:30.583
a huge bounty on!

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.333
He is that fearsome!

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:33.750
Huh?!

00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:36.125
Ohh, but this is perfect.

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:38.167
A virginal knight trampled
under the heel

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.333
of the mighty Shogun.

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.083
No matter how I resist,

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.625
he will force me
into submission

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.792
with his brute strength.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.917
-[excited panting]
-Idiots!

00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.292
This whole rotten world's
full of idiots!

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.167
The people, the food,
the monsters!

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:54.833
It's totally whacked,
and I'm sick of it all!

00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:56.667
[growls]

00:09:56.708 --> 00:09:58.167
[BOTH whimper]

00:09:58.208 --> 00:09:59.667
[hissing]

00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:01.958
[growling]

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:04.792
[gasps]

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.292
H-he broke my blade!

00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:14.125
[growls]

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:17.625
[frightened muttering]

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.083
Spirits like
the Winter Shogun

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.583
tap into the
subconscious thoughts

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:21.833
of people they meet.

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:23.958
That's how they choose
their form.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.583
You know, you're not the only
Japanese person here.

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:27.917
I've reincarnated lots,

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.250
so I bet he got his form
from one of them.

00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:32.333
You mean all it took to bring
this thing to life

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.208
was some jackass
from my country

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.500
walkin' around in the snow
with an overactive imagination?!

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.708
If I ever find out who it was,
I'll kill him!

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:44.167
If she's still lying there
when this is over,

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:46.792
I'm so gonna stomp on her.

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:47.917
-[AQUA] Kazuma!
-[KAZUMA] That's my name!

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.917
The Winter Shogun
is generous.

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.500
All we have to do
is apologize,

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:53.083
and I'm sure
he'll forgive us!

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:54.542
[squeaking]

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.542
[growls]

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:01.417
[inhales deeply]
We're sorry!

00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:02.875
What's everyone waiting for?!

00:11:02.917 --> 00:11:04.250
Bow! Bow!

00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:06.625
Throw your weapons away,
get down and bow!

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.917
Hurry up, Kazuma!
Bow down and say you're sorry!

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.208
Uh-- Uh--

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.333
Kneeling there with
her forehead in the snow,

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.708
she didn't seem like
a goddess now.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.208
I have to give her mad props for
her apology technique, though.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.708
Hey, you heard her!
Get down and apologize!

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.792
Even if no one
sees me,

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:28.417
a knight such as I
cannot bow down to a monster!

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:29.708
[BOTH grunt]

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.375
This ain't the time
to whip out your pride

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:32.875
and start wavin' it around!

00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:34.042
You wanted the last monster

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.292
to chain you up,
remember?!

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:38.208
Get your hands off me!

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.708
How dare you force my head
down onto the cold ground!

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.542
The cold, hard ground!
[giggling]

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:45.542
-Huh?
-[excited panting]

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.542
Your grip is so strong.

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:50.583
[excited panting]
And the snow is so cold!

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:51.833
[AQUA]
Kazuma!

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:53.333
Drop your sword!

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.917
As long as you hold it,
he'll think you're a threat!

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:56.833
Huh?

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:57.708
[sword clangs]

00:12:00.292 --> 00:12:01.292
[gasps]

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.958
Oh, right.
The Winter Shogun killed me.

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:14.458
[GODDESS]
Kazuma Satou?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.833
Uh?

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.750
Welcome to the afterlife.

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.500
I'm Eris, a goddess

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:23.167
who will guide you
onto a new path from here.

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.833
A few moments ago,
you passed on.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.375
I am sorry.

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:35.417
[KAZUMA]
Talk about déjà vu.

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:39.417
This is how it was
when I met Aqua.

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:44.167
You're the goddess everyone
in this world talked about.

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:47.417
Yes. They are my followers.

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:49.333
You came here
all the way from Japan

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:51.458
only to have this happen.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.708
You have suffered so much.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.458
What the--
Is she serious?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.958
She, like,
actually seems sad I died.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.333
Not like that
other dumbass!

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.750
[ERIS] Oh, brave hero
from another world.

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:06.292
Huh? Yes?!

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:08.333
By the grace of my power,

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:11.875
I shall have you reincarnated
to a peaceful life in Japan.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.167
You will be reborn
in a wealthy family

00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:15.875
and have a happy life.

00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:17.958
[KAZUMA] Y-you got
the power to do that?!

00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:20.750
If that is what you wish.

00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:22.458
Sweet!

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.667
I-if it's okay,
can you hook me up

00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.000
with max amounts of charm,
wisdom, and strength?

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:28.667
And this time, can you
make it so I grow up

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.333
with a super-hot girl
as my best friend?!

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:33.042
I, um... I could try?

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:35.792
[relieved sigh]
That would be so awesome!

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:37.750
You don't know how stoked
I am to hear that!

00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:40.875
Man, it feels like I dodged
a big ol' bullet there!

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:44.417
So is this like a reward I get
for trying my hardest?

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:47.583
'Cause up to now, life sucked,
and I could use a reward!

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:48.833
It is.

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.458
Actually, from time to time,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.667
I would look in
on your journey.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.625
I could see how difficult
your days were.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:57.708
Yup! They sure were!

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.250
I reincarnated the first time
thinkin' I'd get to go

00:14:00.292 --> 00:14:02.042
on some adventure,
like in a game.

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:05.042
But I got sold
a load of bull.

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:08.417
The goddess I brought along
as my bonus

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.917
turned out to be both cocky
and useless.

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.917
We had two allies,
this tweeny chick

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.250
with explosions
on her brain

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:17.875
who'd go limp
after casting a spell

00:14:17.917 --> 00:14:19.708
and a pervy
masochistic crusader

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.583
who couldn't hit anything
with her sword.

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:24.792
I was supposed to be
an adventurer,

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:28.417
but I mostly worked construction
and hunted friggin' cabbages.

00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:29.875
After we killed a bad guy,

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:32.250
I was so broke I thought
about sellin' a kidney.

00:14:33.292 --> 00:14:36.042
Hell, I was so poor,
I slept in a stable.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.000
And I damn near
froze to death.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:42.250
It's no fun wakin' up
with frozen eyelashes!

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.500
If you ask me,

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:47.958
that world's game balance
was beyond jacked up.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.875
Wh-- What the hell?

00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:04.792
I'm crying.

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:07.875
After you have been reborn,

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.417
may you have
such kind encounters again.

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:19.875
[KAZUMA]
I get it now.

00:15:20.917 --> 00:15:21.750
In the end,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.875
even though my life
was tough in that crazy world...

00:15:27.417 --> 00:15:28.833
...it was still pretty fun.

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:34.083
And what I'll miss most
is hanging out with my friends.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:37.375
[AQUA]
Come on, Kazuma,

00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:38.750
-get back here!
-Huh?!

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:41.833
[AQUA] You have some nerve
getting killed like that!

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.375
No way are you dying yet!

00:15:43.417 --> 00:15:44.625
Y-you're kidding!!

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.417
Th-that sounds like
Lady Aqua!

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:48.750
Is it really her?!

00:15:48.792 --> 00:15:51.042
[AQUA] I know you can hear me
in there, Kazuma.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.750
I cast a resurrection spell
on you,

00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:55.625
so hurry up already
and come on back to this side!

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:57.750
No way! I can go back?!

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.708
Oh! I'm sorry!
One moment!

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.250
According to the laws
of Heaven,

00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:02.958
since you were not born
of that world,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.250
if you die there,
you cannot return to it!

00:16:05.292 --> 00:16:07.875
Oh, for real?
Hey, Aqua!

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:09.375
She says I can't come back,

00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:11.000
'cause the laws of Heaven
don't let people

00:16:11.042 --> 00:16:13.583
who weren't born there
come back or... something!

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:16.292
[AQUA] Huh?!
That has to be

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.542
the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:20.833
Whatever goddess told you that
is an idiot!

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.500
You let that dummy know
that I'm an elite goddess

00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:24.625
in charge of Japan!

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:26.833
I won't take
any lip from her!

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:29.542
[KAZUMA] Damn, Aqua,
dial back on the insults!

00:16:29.583 --> 00:16:31.958
This one looks like she's gonna
start to cry any second!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.417
She heard you.

00:16:34.458 --> 00:16:36.833
Oh, and by the way,
she told me her name's Eris.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.417
Eris?!

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:40.542
You mean the Eris
who thinks she's so special

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:42.125
just 'cause she has
her own currency here

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.250
and a couple followers?

00:16:43.292 --> 00:16:44.583
That overrated twerp?!

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:45.583
[gasps]

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.083
-Hey, Kazuma!
-Yeah?

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.333
If she keeps
giving you trouble,

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:49.500
tell her
I'll let everyone know

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:50.583
she pads her bra.

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:51.917
-Okay, okay, you win!
-That true?

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.750
I'll make an exception
this time!

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:55.583
I'll open the gate
for him right away!

00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:56.833
They're pads?

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:59.208
Honestly, Lady Aqua is
as unreasonable...

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.542
-[KAZUMA] Those are pads?!
-...as she ever was.

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:03.667
[ERIS]
Konosuba!

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:04.625
[KAZUMA]
Hey, I'm cool with pads.

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:07.125
Uh...

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.667
That will take you
to the living world.

00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:12.000
Even though this is not
usually how it's done.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:16.125
May I ask you for a favor?

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:18.292
Huh? O-oh, yeah!

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.667
If you don't mind...

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.292
...please keep this secret.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.500
[gasps]

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.708
[AQUA] [distant]
Kazuma!

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.542
Kazuma, please wake up!

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:50.542
Kazuma!

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:51.542
[gasps]

00:17:51.583 --> 00:17:53.083
[giggles]

00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:54.542
Good, you came back!

00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:57.583
I can't believe how uptight
she was about the rules.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:59.292
[MEGUMIN/DARKNESS]
Kazuma!

00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:00.792
[crying]

00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:02.708
[KAZUMA]
This is nice...

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.292
...and kinda weird.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.417
Oh, it's okay, Kazuma!

00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:09.042
Don't just lie there blushing,
say something already!

00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:12.750
I performed
a small miracle there

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.208
bringing you back to life.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.292
Don't you have anything
to say in return? Come on!

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.958
[KAZUMA]
Yeah, I got something to say.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.750
I wanna trade you in
for the other one.

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:23.167
The cuter one!

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:25.708
Now, I know you can think
of something.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.750
Start simple,
like by thanking me

00:18:27.792 --> 00:18:29.833
or maybe saying you're sorry
for how horribly you treated

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.042
an amazing goddess such as--

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:33.625
I wanna swap you out
for the other goddess!

00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:36.292
You damn NEET,
you asked for it!

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.625
You like Eris so much?!

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:40.208
How about if I send you
back to her in pieces!

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.750
[KAZUMA screaming]

00:18:41.792 --> 00:18:44.667
A-Aqua! That isn't
very goddess-like!

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:45.833
Are you alright?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.167
Nothing about you feels off

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:48.667
or anything, I hope.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:51.875
N-no, I think I'm okay.

00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:53.750
[relieved sigh]
Thank goodness.

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:55.750
You were killed
in such a horrible way.

00:18:55.792 --> 00:18:59.083
What? Like, how horrible
are we talkin'?

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:01.042
Not only is
the Winter Shogun generous,

00:19:01.083 --> 00:19:02.667
he's merciful, too.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.667
With one graceful slice,
he cut your head clean off.

00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:07.792
H-he cut my head off?!

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.000
Oh my god!

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:13.667
[wind whistling]

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:15.625
[KAZUMA]
Winter here is no joke.

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:18.208
It's cold as hell,
and food's hard to come by.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.958
The only things
that should be out here now

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.083
are things that are
strong enough to survive.

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:23.208
Like monsters.

00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:26.167
For beginners like us,

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.958
there's no such thing
as an easy winter quest.

00:19:30.417 --> 00:19:32.292
Alright. Let's bail.

00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:35.875
-[AQUA] Ko!
-[KAZUMA] No!

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:37.042
-[MEGUMIN] Su!
-[DARKNESS] Ba!

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:44.250
[AQUA]
Ta-da!

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.583
-You kept one!
-That's right!

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.375
I wasn't just bowing
when I was bowing,

00:19:49.417 --> 00:19:50.750
I was hiding him!

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.000
When I opened my jar,

00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:54.583
I only pretended
to let all of them out.

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:55.917
Guess I was so convincing,

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.542
not even the Winter Shogun
knew I had him.

00:19:58.583 --> 00:20:00.208
Way to fake him out, Aqua!

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.958
Come on.
Hand that sucker over,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.250
and I'll kill it
and cash it in.

00:20:03.292 --> 00:20:04.708
Oh no, you won't!

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.042
I'm taking him home and turning
him into a refrigerator!

00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.333
Are you crazy?!

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.125
They're worth a hundred thousand
apiece dead!

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.958
No! You can't kill him!
I won't let you!

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.167
I already gave him
a name and everything!

00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:17.458
I won't let you kill him!
I won't, I won't!

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.500
It's just a Snow Sprite.

00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:21.083
Let her keep it, Kazuma.

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:23.750
Okay, fine.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:26.167
Uh?
[relieved sigh]

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:27.417
[giggles]

00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:29.208
I'm going to take
good care of you

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.208
and when summer comes around,
I'll have you make lots of ice.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.458
Then, we'll open
a snow cone shop together!

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.583
And when the nights get hot,
I'll put you next to my pillow.

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:40.708
What do these things eat,
anyway?

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.958
I have no idea.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.833
Do those things
even have to eat?

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:47.167
I like how soft and fluffy
Snow Sprites look.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:49.500
I'd imagine if you sprinkled
a little sugar on it,

00:20:49.542 --> 00:20:50.875
it would be quite tasty.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.833
Don't even think
about eating him!

00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:55.542
On that note, I am starting
to get hungry.

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:58.750
[AQUA]
Let's order something!

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:01.667
I wonder what
the special is today,

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.375
[KAZUMA]
She was a goddess.

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:06.167
She looked like
she actually felt sorry

00:21:06.208 --> 00:21:07.625
about me dying.

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:10.500
And she looked happy for me
when I was revived.

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:13.917
If you don't mind...

00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:16.333
...please keep this secret.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.375
[KAZUMA]
She's a sweet, beautiful girl

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:19.833
who's not a nutjob!

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:21.417
After all this time here,

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:24.542
I think I finally met
my one true love!

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.125
[AQUA]
Don't just sit there, Kazuma.

00:21:26.167 --> 00:21:27.542
-Eat!
-Huh?

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:32.292
What in the hell'd you order
all this food for?!

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.042
[MEGUMIN] If you get to be
as great a magician as I am,

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.333
you have to eat hearty meals

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:38.750
so you can function
at the highest level.

00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:40.125
-[AQUA] Spoilsport.
-Say what?!

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:41.333
[AQUA] I brought you back
to life today,

00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:42.833
-so why don't you live a little!
-Huh?

00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:44.583
[AQUA] It's okay
to treat ourselves.

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.083
By the way, we're using
some of the reward

00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:47.250
we got to pay for this.

00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:48.708
But that money's
supposed to get us

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.042
through the winter!

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:51.417
-[DARKNESS] Relax.
-No!

00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:53.167
[DARKNESS] If we run out
of money, we can always go

00:21:53.208 --> 00:21:54.500
on another quest.

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:56.333
One with a good monster,

00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:59.500
Yes, a monster that secretes
loads of slime would be nice!

00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:01.917
Or perhaps one with big,
floppy tentacles!

00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:02.958
[gasps]

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.042
Just thinking about them

00:22:04.083 --> 00:22:05.375
grasping me makes me quiver!

00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:07.542
[KAZUMA groans]

00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:10.958
On second thought,
I made the wrong choice.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.833
I should have reincarnated
back to Japan!

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:47.875
[MEGUMIN] Megumin, the
extraordinary magical genius.

00:23:47.917 --> 00:23:49.667
Beneath her charming exterior

00:23:49.708 --> 00:23:51.917
lay tremendous Explosion magic.

00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:53.792
It was so spectacular
to beho--
