[TOWNSPEOPLE clamoring]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.208
All citizens must
evacuate immediately!

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.125
Adventurers, equip yourselves
and report to the Guild!

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.708
Hey, don't just
stand there!

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.542
We have to leave!
It'll be here any minute!

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:24.625
What will?

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.667
The mobile fortress, Destroyer.

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.583
It's suicide to try to fight
something so fearsome.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.042
Can someone tell me
what a Destroyer even is?!

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.542
[DARKNESS]
It is an ancient weapon.

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:37.792
And wherever
it rampages through,

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.542
not even the grass remains.

Come on, guys.
Let's head to the Guild.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.625
You're crazy!

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.208
We worked our asses
to the bone for this house!

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.375
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let anything happen to it!

[clanking, rumbling]

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.500
[LUNA] You are the only hope
this town has.

Thank you for putting
your lives on the line to help.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.625
Okay, everyone,
our intel shows

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.042
the mobile fortress, Destroyer,

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:49.875
is approaching
from the northwest.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:52.375
Our town stands
directly in its path.

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:54.625
It will be at our walls
within one hour.

Question.

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:07.292
I heard it was made
a long time ago

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.458
with advanced
magical technology.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.833
Can't we ask its creators
how to neutralize it?

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.375
Or how to break
its magic barrier?

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:15.958
When the Destroyer
switched on,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.208
its creators were
the first to die.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.375
[KAZUMA]
How's a town full of noobs

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:20.958
supposed to stop this thing?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.583
Talk about a hard level!

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.292
If Kyouya were here,
he'd know what to do,

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.292
Yeah, how come
he ain't here?

[grunts softly]

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.375
Face it, we should get
out of here while we can.

-We cannot.
-[CHRIS] Huh?

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:33.833
It is our duty to protect

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.625
the homes of the townspeople.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:36.875
[CHRIS]
I swear, Darkness,

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.958
you can be so stubborn.

-Hey. You.
-[KAZUMA] Mm.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.750
You got any bright ideas?

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:44.708
Not off the bat, I don't.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.708
Hmm.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.833
Oh! Hey, Aqua.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:49.917
You think you can bust
through its magic barrier?

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.375
I have no way to know
unless I try.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.250
Are you saying you can break
the Destroyer's magic barrier?!

00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.125
N-no one's saying anything!
I-I was just wondering!

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:02.500
Well, can't you and your party
at least try?

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.375
I-I guess?

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:08.792
Alright. But we still need
the firepower to kill it.

[ADVENTURER]
Oh, we got that.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.875
Sure she's small,
but she packs a wallop.

You know, the crazy one.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.333
Yeah, that weirdo's the bomb.
Literally!

don't you dare call me
by any name other than my own!

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:33.292
and I'll show you
how crazy I am.

Your Explosion magic
could put the odds in our favor.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:42.625
It could save the town.

Hmm.

A-as fearsome as it is,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.458

to take it down in one blow.

Dude, you don't know
about her?!

Before she opened
her shop here,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.250
she had a rep for being
this great arch-wizard.

their pants if they knew

what you do,

given my
usual behavior, but...

...I am a knight, remember?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.917
Do you think I would put
desire before duty?

Yeah, that's exactly
what you're doing.

They might not know why
or even care, but still,

it is my duty
to protect them.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:20.875
Why them, in particular?

is Lalatina Dustiness Ford.

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.042
is even worse
than making fun of my name!

00:09:56.083 --> 00:10:00.458
You want an explosion?
I shall show you an explosion!

The time of awakening
hath come.

come forth, oh Justice,
as an intangible distortion!

You did good.

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:05.417

all the crap I said.

I cannot withdraw
until the battle has ended.

about exposing myself

-[gasps, shudders]

I feel a rising excitement
I have never felt before.

Will I be able
to withstand the blast?

No matter how sturdy I am,

to save the town!

I stayed in this town

for all it's given us!

we'll protect it!

Kazuma,
I have an idea.

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.958
The self-destruct
must have a power source.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.542
If we find it,
we can shut it down.

00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:42.250
Don't tell Darkness that.

00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:44.500

on getting blown up today.

Eww.

He's quite dead.

[AQUA] Well, at least
he's not undead!

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:21.583
Look at him,
he must've died peacefully,

00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:23.125
without a single regret.

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.333
Wait. What are you
talking about?!

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.417
He died alone!

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.208
I mean,
can you even imagine

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.583
what that was like for him?

00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:32.667
[AQUA]
What's this?

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.792
"I can't believe what these
big shots want me to do."

00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:46.542
[KAZUMA]
Damn. That's his diary.

00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:50.250
[DESTROYER CREATOR] They asked
what I'd use to power it.

00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:51.583
Hell if I know!

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:55.375
To get them off my back,
I asked for something rare,

00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:56.542
coronatite.

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:01.083
Dammit, they brought some!
Now what?!

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:04.000
If this doesn't work,
they'll execute me!

00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:06.583
It has to work!
Please work! Please!

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:12.583
Well, it's done.
And it's out of control.

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.083
Oh my god!

00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:17.792
The kingdom's fallen!
Everyone's dead!

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.500
This thing works
as ordered, though,

00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:21.833
so hey, nice job, me!

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:24.417
Anyway, I can't stop this thing
and can't get out,

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:27.417
so I think I'll be spending
the rest of my life in it.

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:30.083
What kind of idiot forgets
to make an off switch?!

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:35.958
Oh right. I'm the idiot that
forgot to make an off switch.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.458
-[KAZUMA/AQUA] Humph!
-[WIZ] Eee!

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.625
-[AQUA] The end.
-You asshole!

-[AQUA] Ko!
-[KAZUMA] No!

-[DARKNESS] Su!
-[MEGUMIN] Ba!

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.333
[KAZUMA] [sighs] Dust and
the others got out okay.

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:49.667
So, now what do we do?

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:52.750
The coronatite could explode
at any minute.

00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:54.667
You're a goddess,
can't you do something?

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:55.958
-Hm?
-Don't "Hm" me.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.250
Ain't sealing away
evil crap

00:15:57.292 --> 00:15:59.083
a basic goddessy thing to do?

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.875
What idiot gave you
that idea?!

00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:02.750
But I bet someone like Wiz
can deal with it,

00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:04.500
-can't you, Wiz?
-Uh...

00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:08.208
I could use
a teleportation spell to--

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.708
-Yeah, do that!
-But I can't.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.833
I don't have enough magic!

00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:14.125
-Um, Kazuma?
-Yeah?

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:16.625
[WIZ]
I have a request.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:19.667
Sure. What is it?

00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:25.667
Would you please let me
suck it out?

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.417
Absolutely.

00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:30.333
I won't be crude and ask
"suck what" or "suck how,"

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:32.083
'cause this ain't
the time for jokes.

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.000
I trust you,
so... suck away.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:38.083
Thank you so much
for letting me!

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:39.667
-[KAZUMA] No, thank you.
-Now, then.

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.750
[KAZUMA]
Bring it.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:44.250
Mom. Dad.

00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:46.333
I lost my virginity
in this parallel wo--

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:48.125
Whoa!

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:50.750
Drain Touch! I'm so sorry!

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:54.083
[screaming, grunting]

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:55.500
Hey, stop it!

00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:57.083
That's enough,
he's getting all shriveled up!

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.208
[groans]

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.500
[KAZUMA]
Yup. That sucked,

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:05.042
I think I have enough to use
my teleportation spell!

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.125
[KAZUMA] [strained voice]
Good for you.

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.417
[WIZ]
Now, where to send it?

00:17:08.458 --> 00:17:10.625
There are only a few places
where I can.

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:12.458
Well, send it somewhere!

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.250
That thing changed
from glowing a scary red

00:17:14.292 --> 00:17:15.625
to a super-scary white!

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.583
I can send it away
immediately

00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:19.250
if I do a random teleport.

00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:20.208
Yeah, do that!

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.708
I don't know.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.375
