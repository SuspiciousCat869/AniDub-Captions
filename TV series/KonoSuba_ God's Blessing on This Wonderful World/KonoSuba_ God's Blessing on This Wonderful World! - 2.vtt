Life in another world,
ain't as cool as I thought!

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.500
I barely get by
as a noob adventurer.

Adventurers aren't
badasses at all.

They're just a bunch
of day-laboring nobodies.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.292
If this was Japan,
they couldn't even afford

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.667
a capsule hotel
down some dank alley.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.708

[sniffles]

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.292

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.750

Oh, good morning.

Don't "good morning" me.
It's almost freakin' noon.

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:08.125
I thought we were doing
a kill quest today.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.125
Oh, right.

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.583
Since we weren't going
to work,

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:13.625
I thought I'd sleep in
for once.

-Hello?

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:21.542
Didn't you say this world
was supposed

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.542
to be under attack
by the Devil King?

-[BOY] Cannonball!
-There's nothin' evil going on!

It couldn't get
any more peaceful here!

Well, of course.
This town's the furthest

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.583
from the Devil King's castle.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.958
He wouldn't go out of his way
just to attack a place

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.292
that has nothing
but amateur adventurers in it!

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.958
Good point.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.250
Now that I'm awake,
let's go on that kill quest!

You can count on me,
so don't you worry!

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.208
Yeah, that still doesn't make me
feel any better about it.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:52.250
Oh well! You are
a goddess after all.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:53.875
We should be fine.

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:55.583
Alright! Let's find
some cheap gear

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.208
and go kill some monsters!

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.250

You should see how red
your face is, Kazuma!

You look so desperate!

-[croaking]
-[KAZUMA] Giant Toads, man.

Way scarier
than your typical frog.

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:13.792
Goats are their
favorite food.

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.458
During the Giant Toad's
mating season,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.000
they need strength
to lay their eggs,

00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:19.958
so they show up at farms
and swallow the goats whole.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.458
That's right, whole.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.000
And get this, every year
during their mating season,

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:26.875
it's not unusual
for a couple farmers

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:28.500
and kids to go missing.

00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:29.958
Think about that!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.250
In case you're wondering
how Toad meat tastes,

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.667
it's a little tough,
but light and refreshing.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.375
In these parts,
it's a delicacy.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.583
If you really, really want me
to save you,

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:44.583
all you have to do
is call me "Lady Aqua!"

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.667
[KAZUMA]
Lady Aqua!

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:47.833

Uh. Huh?

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.917
First, when we get back
into town,

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.500
you're going to join
the Axis sect

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.542
and pray to me
three times a day.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.833
Second, at meal time,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.583
if I ask for something
off your plate,

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.000
you have to give it to me.

00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.583

Come on, let's just
call it a day.

It's obvious these things
are way more than we can handle.

in this disgusting slimy state,

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:57.625
they'd lose their faith in me!

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:01.583

mouth open, droolin' all over.

Maybe you should lower
your standards a little.

I think your "only

00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:07.792
But if I'm surrounded
by a bunch of elites like you,

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.208
I'd feel like a loser. So--

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.000
[WIZARD] I saw your notice
calling for adventurers.

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:13.000
-Ah!
-Uh...

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:14.125
[WIZARD chuckles]

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:15.375
That we should meet
is a fate

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:17.667
chosen by this world.

00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:18.958
At last,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.667
my search
for suitable companions

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:22.708
to quest with
has come to an end.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.208
[cape flutters]

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.042
My name is Megumin!

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.667
I am an arch-wizard
who wields "Explosion,"

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.375
the most powerful,
most feared,

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:34.458
most deadly spell
in all the land!

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.417
[fluttering stops]

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:38.833
For real?

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.417
[chuckles]

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:42.417
Dost thou desire
to align yourself

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.500
with a power so fearsome,
its user has been shunned?

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:46.667
Huh?

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:48.875
If so, show me thy resolve

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:50.625
and stare into
the ultimate abyss

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:51.917
with me,
but take heed.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.417
For if thou dost stare
into it,

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.292
the abyss shalt
also stare into thee.

00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:00.500
Are you pullin' my leg
or somethin'?

00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:01.875
N-no, of course not!

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:04.917
-[AQUA] Your eye is red.
-Hmm?

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.833
Are you a Crimson Demon?

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.833
Indeed!
I am Megumin,

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.583
the greatest mage
in the Crimson Demons!

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.667
My lethal powers can demolish
the tallest mountains!

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:17.333
Smash the hardest... stone...

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.417
[thuds]

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:20.958
-Huh?
-Hey! A-are you okay?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.500
[stomach rumbling]

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.750
[groans] I haven't had a thing
to eat in three whole days.

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:30.500
I'd appreciate it if you
could spare some food.

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:32.792
If you're that hungry,
I can spot you.

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.667
But what's with
the eye patch?

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:37.417
'Cause I mean, my friend here
can heal you, if you want.

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.417
Healing magic is, like,
her only skill.

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:42.125
-My what?!
-[MEGUMIN chuckles]

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:43.458
This is no eyepatch

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.958
but a magic item
which suppresses my powers.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.583
I dare not ever remove it.

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.667
For if I did,
a great catastrophe

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.833
would befall this world.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:56.542
You're kidding!
So it's like a seal?

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:58.167
No, it's just an eyepatch.

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:00.917
I, uh, wear it
'cause it looks neat.

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.375
Ah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Please don't pull on it!

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.292
No, stop!
You'll break it!

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.667
Hang on.

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.958
Children of the Crimson
Demon Clan are born

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.208
with high intelligence
and magical powers.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.625
They're supposed to be
expert spell-casters.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.958
And they all have
weird names, like her.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.917
Then she's for real?

00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.125
-[band snaps]
-[MEGUMIN] Ahh!

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.667
My poor eye!

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:22.250
Sorry about that.

00:11:22.292 --> 00:11:24.125
But I thought you were
messin' around with us.

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:26.667
With all your weird talk
and your weird name, go figure.

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:28.000
[MEGUMIN groans]

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.042
Will you stop
making fun of my name?

00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:32.000
To me, everyone here has
a weird name,

00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:34.208
but where I come from,
mine is totally normal.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.958
Then what are your mom
and dad called.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.458
My mother is Yuiyui,
and my father is Hyoizaburo!

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:47.750
As long as she can do magic
like you say, let's take her.

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:48.958
Alright, that does it!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.042
You can laugh at my name,

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:51.333
but if you make fun
of my parents,

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:52.417
I'll make you regret it!

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.542
[MEGUMIN]
Hyoizaburo!

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:01.917
[stomach rumbling]

00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.292
You know how you can't forge
an adventurer's card?

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.500
-Yeah.
-Well, according to hers,

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:07.083
she's definitely
an arch-wizard.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:08.958
-Huh...
-This girl is capable

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.833
of using powerful
offensive magic!

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:14.458
Yeah, her stat's pretty high.
Like, super high.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.542
I know!

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:17.250
It's a big deal
if she can conjure

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:19.125
Explosion magic
like she says.

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:21.333
Why, that's the most advanced
magical attack!

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.333
[groans]

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.375
Listen, I don't go by "she"

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:25.583
or "this girl."

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.583
I have a name,
so please use it!

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.125
[stomach rumbling]

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.250
[chuckles]

00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:33.750
So, "arch-wizard,"

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:34.917
wanna order something?

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:46.167
Explosion is
the strongest spell.

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:47.792
And the more powerful
the spell,

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.458
the more time
it takes to conjure.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:51.833
Keep that frog busy

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.500
until I am done
with my preparations.

00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.542
I can handle one, no sweat.

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:58.500
[AQUA]
Uh, there's another one!

[KAZUMA]
Damn, they're sneaky!

00:13:03.292 --> 00:13:05.875
Alright, focus your spell
on the furthest one out.

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:07.208
I can manage that.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.333
We got this one.

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:10.625
Aqua, I hope you're ready.

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:13.000
We could use your you-know-what
powers right about now.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.500
Come on, show us what a great
you-know-what you used to be!

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:16.667
Oh, shut your mouth!

00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:18.083
I'm still a goddess,
you hear?

00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:19.708
No "used to be" about it!

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.500
You're a goddess?

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:24.500
Um! No, that's just
what she just calls herself!

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:27.042
She says all sorts of crazy
things when she's stressed.

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:28.458
Kinda sad, actually.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.708
[MEGUMIN]
Poor thing.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.750
[crying] Wh-whatever!

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:34.208
I don't care how resistant
these are to attacks.

-Uh--

00:13:36.042 --> 00:13:37.833
[AQUA]
Just you watch, Kazuma!

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.000
I'll show you what the powers
of a goddess can do!

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:42.667
Tremble before me, creature!

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:47.417
God Requiem!
A most lethal attack!

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:49.958
A requiem for
a goddess's love and sorrow!

Ah!

00:13:58.167 --> 00:13:59.708
That's a goddess for you.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.000

I beseech thee.

The time of awakening
hath come.

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:14.292
From the boundaries
of righteousness,

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:18.000
come, oh Justice,

into a destructive force,
one without equal!

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:28.125
Return all of creation
to cinders

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.792
and rise from the abyss!

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:31.375
Grant your humble servant

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.708
the most powerful attack
ever known!

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.375
Grant your humble servant
the ultimate attack spell!

Uh-oh. I guess the explosion
woke it up from its nap.

Hey, Megumin!
Let's fall back and--

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:18.917
Huh?

Even though my
Explosion spell is powerful,

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.542
using it takes
a lot of energy.

00:15:27.708 --> 00:15:31.000
I overexerted myself
conjuring it, so now,

00:15:31.042 --> 00:15:34.292
well, I can't move
a muscle.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.792

Oh no.

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:40.542
I didn't expect
a frog to pop up nearby.

00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:43.250
This is bad.
I'll be eaten.

00:15:43.292 --> 00:15:45.583
Sorry, but could you please do
something before it--

00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:54.292
No, don't get eaten yet!

how big that tadpole is!

Horrible!

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:13.708
I don't know if you knew,
but the inside of a frog

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.208
is both stinky and cozy.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.750
Gee, thanks.
I can die happy now.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:21.792
You're banned from using
Explosion again,

00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:23.333
unless it's an emergency.

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.625
From now on, stick to
less apocalyptic magic.

-That's not possible.

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:38.375
Seriously.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.708
-Get back here, darn it!
-[ducks honking]

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.708
But If your level is high enough
to use Explosion,

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.958
shouldn't you be able
to use other magic, too?

00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.625
Why, even I couldn't learn
all the arch-priest spells

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:54.292
I needed to
until after I learned

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:56.042
all the party tricks first.

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:58.875
[KAZUMA] What monster
would you use a party trick on?

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.708
I am an arch-wizard
who loves

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.750
Explosion magic
more than anything.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:05.917
I can't stand the other spells
in the detonation family.

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.542
They suck!
Explosion is the one for me!

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:11.333
I'll admit, quests
would be easier for me

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:13.667
if I learned other spells.
But I refuse!

00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:16.500
I love the Explosion spell
more than anything!

00:17:16.542 --> 00:17:18.542
I don't care that I can
only use it once a day

00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:21.500
or that it drains me so much
it knocks me on my face.

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:24.667
I will always,
always love Explosion!

00:17:24.708 --> 00:17:28.083
When I started, I chose to walk
the path of the arch-wizard

00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:30.792
just so I could cast
that one glorious spell!

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:36.167
That's amazing!
And wonderful!

00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:38.208
Even though your goal
is totally bonkers,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.292
I love the passion
you have for it!

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:44.500
[KAZUMA] So, basically,
this mage is useless.

00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:46.458
Hell, if Aqua gets
where she's comin' from,

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.667
she's gotta be.

00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:48.667
[BOTH chuckle]

00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:49.792
[KAZUMA]
I mean, just goin' off

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:51.417
how our two fights
with the Toads went,

00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:54.333
this "goddess" is
as useless as it gets!

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.667
[groans]

00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:58.292
The last thing I need's
another Aqua in my life.

00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.292
Oh well! It sounds like
life's gonna be tough for you,

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.875
but keep hangin' in there!

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.917
Once we get back to the guild,
we'll split the reward,

00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.500
and then maybe we'll see you
again some--

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:08.583
[groans]

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:10.042
The only thing I want to do

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:12.125
is use my Explosion spell.

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:13.250
If I can do that,

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.208
I don't need a share
of the reward.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.500
But for the cost of a meal
and basic necessities,

00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:21.167
you can have the power
of an arch-wizard!

00:18:21.208 --> 00:18:22.958
Just give me
a permanent spot

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.875
in your party,
and I'm all yours.

00:18:24.917 --> 00:18:26.250
No, I couldn't!

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:28.375
A talented mage
like yourself would be wasted

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:31.292
on a couple of small-time
amateurs like us!

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:32.750
[MEGUMIN]
No, not at all!

00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:35.500
I don't care if you're
small-time, or amateurs!

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:36.792
I might be an advanced class,

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.208
but I'm only level six!

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.583
We'd make a great team!

00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:41.208
P-please stop pulling
my hand away!

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.500
But if you can
only do one spell a day,

00:18:43.542 --> 00:18:46.083
what's the point
in having you with us?!

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.250
Ugh. She might suck
as a mage,

00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:50.208
but she's got
one hell of a grip!

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.125
Would you let go
of me already?!

00:18:52.167 --> 00:18:54.042
I bet you got dumped
by another party,

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:56.000
and that's why
you're so desperate!

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:57.250
Anyway, if we're
in a dungeon,

00:18:57.292 --> 00:18:59.625
you can't use Explosion,
you'll kill us all!

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:00.875
We can't use you!

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:02.583
Hey, keep your slime
to yourself!

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:05.875
Please take me, please!
No other parties will have me!

00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:08.375
I'll do whatever you want!
I'll carry your stuff!

00:19:08.417 --> 00:19:10.125
Please don't abandon me
like this,

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.250
-I'm begging you!
-Oh dear!

00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:13.083
That man's going
to abandon that child!

00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:14.208
[KAZUMA/MEGUMIN grunting]

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.125
Do you see
the other girl there?!

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:17.667
She's covered in slime!

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:19.417
He defiled
that poor little girl,

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.083
and now he's
throwing her away!

00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:24.042
Oh my gosh! Both those girls
are covered in icky goo!

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:25.708
-[WOMAN whimper]
-What kind of sick game

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.083
was that pervert
playing with them?!

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.208
Oh, come on!
It's not like that!

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.333
-Hmm.
-[gasps]

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:32.750
[MEGUMIN chuckles]

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:37.250
Don't leave me!

00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:39.583
I'll play whatever kinky games
you wanna play!

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:43.208
I'll even do that slime-act with
the frogs again, just don't--

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.708
Alright, alright, you win!
Welcome to the party!

00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:47.750
[KAZUMA/AQUA/MEGUMIN]
KonoSuba.

00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:53.667
I confirmed you completed
your quest.

00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.667
Nice work out there!

00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:58.250
No way, I went up
four whole levels.

00:19:58.292 --> 00:19:59.667
I didn't know
you could advance so much

00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:02.000
just by killing
a few monsters.

00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:04.042
It's true!
And the newer the adventurer is,

00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:05.500
the faster they'll level up.

00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:08.083
Now, after adding the Toads
we bought from you

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:10.125
plus the award
for completing the quest,

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.500
the total is one hundred
ten thousand eris.

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:15.250
Does that amount
sound right to you?

00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:21.250
Damn, this sucks.

00:20:21.292 --> 00:20:23.542
A hundred ten grand
split three ways

00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:26.042
is just
thirty-six grand each.

00:20:26.083 --> 00:20:28.125
[sighs]

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.458
We nearly got ourselves
killed and for what.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.625
Thirty-six lousy grand?

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:34.792
It's not worth it.

00:20:35.792 --> 00:20:38.917
The other quests on the board
ain't much better.

00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:42.292
[MAN] Help me find my lost pet.
He's a white wolf!

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:44.958
[WOMAN] Seeking a tutor
in swordsmanship for my son.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.458
Applicants must either be
a rune knight or a swordmaster.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.667
[MAN 2]
Would you like to take part

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.333
in my magical experiments?

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.875
Only those with high HP

00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:56.042
or strong magical resistance
need apply!

00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:58.042
Yeah, no, thank you.

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:04.542
Man, I wish I could
go back to Japan.

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.458
The only ally
we got up to now sucks.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.542
It ain't gonna be easy
livin' in this world.

00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.833
I saw your poster.
I hope I'm not late.

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:18.083
Are you still recruiting
adventurers for your party?

00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:21.833
Umm...

00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:25.167
Y-yeah, we are!
I-I wouldn't recommend it!

00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:26.792
But i-if you really wanna?

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:32.708
She's a knight.
An unbelievably gorgeous knight!

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.708
Crap. She's so pretty

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.708
I got nervous,
and my voice squeaked.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.000
Side-effect from bein'
a shut-in for so long.

00:21:39.042 --> 00:21:40.958
God, I'm such a dork!

00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:44.500
That's good.
I was worried.

00:21:44.542 --> 00:21:46.375
You see, I have been
waiting ages

00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:48.458
for the right party
to come along.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.458
[shaky breath]

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:55.792
My name is Darkness.

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:59.542
A-and my class
is... crusader.

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:04.792
[panting]

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:08.542
If you would have me,
I-I'd like to j-join your...

00:22:09.542 --> 00:22:13.083
...p-p-p-p-p-party, please!

00:23:44.542 --> 00:23:45.917
[KAZUMA]
Dear Dad,

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:48.625
I think I'm used to life
in this parallel world now.

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:49.750
I keep busy every day

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:51.875
with a group
of dependable friends.

00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:53.792
Work is going well,
and I've been com--
