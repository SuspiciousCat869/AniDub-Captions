[AQUA sneezes]

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:14.917
So cold!

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:18.833
I can't believe I pawned
my gorgeous, warm coat.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.625
Oh no! The fire!

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.208
There!

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.875
The hell do you think
you're doing?

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:29.625
Give me back my tracksuit!

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.583
This is the only reminder
I have of Japan,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:32.833
and you're trying to burn it!

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.417
The fire was going out!

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.333
It's the only thing
we have left to burn!

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.750
What about your scarf?!

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:40.292
It'd burn way better
than my poor tracksuit!

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.250
Let go of it,
you shut-in NEET!

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.167
Why don't you do something?!

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.083
Breathe on me, hug me,
warm me up!

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:53.125
No, don't die!

[sobbing]

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.125
I can't go on like this.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.875
We have to do something.

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:46.167
[KAZUMA] Our party
was anything but balanced.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.167
So today, I was on the hunt
for a skill

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:49.917
I could use
as my main weapon.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:55.417
Well, here we are.
Listen up.

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.667
I'm only gonna say this once,
behave yourself in there,

00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:58.792
you got it?

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.250
Who do you think
you're talking to?!

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:02.750
I am always perfectly behaved,
thank you!

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.292
Really! Do I look like
some kind of low-life thug?

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.042
Hello, I'm a goddess,
you moron!

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.333
Hey! Don't you walk away
from me!

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:11.417
Be grateful a goddess
like me even speaks to you!

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.583
Please, come--

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.792
[screams]

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:16.292
You?!

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.500
[grunts]
Come here, you undead tramp!

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:21.000
Who said you could open
a shop in my town?!

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:23.417
How come I have to sleep
in a stable every night?

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.042
Where'd you get the money
to open this place?!

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.000
What, you think
you're better than me?! Huh?!

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.542
By the gods,
I'll burn this place

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:30.542
to the ground with you--

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:36.542
Howdy, Wiz. How you been?

[pouting]

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.833
Are you going to serve some tea
or just stand there?

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.833
Oh! Right. I'm sorry!

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.542
I-I'll bring some
right away!

-[glass shatters]
-[Wiz yelps]

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:54.083
Still as klutzy as ever.

[bubbling]

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.250
[KAZUMA]
So, this here's Wiz.

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:01.250
She looks human,
but she's really a lich.

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:03.750
She's a type of undead ruler
they call a "No-Life King,"

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.583
which, yeah, sounds weird.

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:09.333
Even though she's a lich,
she's pretty sweet.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.417
She'd go to the graveyard
and help lost souls

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:12.833
get to Heaven.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.125
We bumped into her there,

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.958
and Aqua was gonna kill her.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.583
But I talked her out of it,
and we promised Wiz

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.458
that Aqua would take over
her duties.

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.708
I hope you like it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.958
[slurps]

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.417
Yum!

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.000
How is it
an undead can have

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.292
a shop here
and have nice, warm tea

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:35.875
while the rest of us
live in stables?

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.083
I know, I'm sorry!

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.500
Someone like me
shouldn't be afforded

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:39.542
such luxuries!

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:40.583
Look, I'm warning you,

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.625
quit being a brat to her!

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:47.458
Hey, Wiz? I got some
spare points here.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.875
Could you please
teach me a skill?

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.542
-[spits]
-Ugh!

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:52.000
What in the hell
are you saying?!

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.625
Have you completely
lost your mind?!

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:55.042
There's no way
a goddess is going

00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:56.500
to let her servant
learn lich skills!

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.917
Yo, I'm not your servant!

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.083
Look here,
liches are icky.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:03.750
They love dank, gloomy places
like crypts and dungeons.

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.167
I mean,
when you think about it,

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:06.667
they're pretty much
the same as slugs!

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:07.792
Hey, that's mean!

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.500
Who cares?
it's not every day

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.083
a person gets
to learn skills from a lich.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.708
The whole point in learning 'em
is to give us

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.583
a leg up on quests,
so it's totally worth it.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.250
-Hold on.
-Hm?

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:20.333
Just now, she said
she was a goddess.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:21.833
-Uh--
-Uh-huh!

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:24.625
I am Aqua.
The goddess Aqua!

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.083
Worshipped by
the Religious Order of Axis.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.083
Renounce your evil ways, Lich!

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.000
[whimpering]

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:33.833
It's okay, Wiz. There's nothing
to be scared about.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.083
No, there is!

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:36.583
The Axis sect is filled

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.042
with crazy people and,

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:40.125
and everyone knows
they should be avoided.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:42.333
So, if she's
the one they worship,

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.458
she must be even more insane
than her followers!

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.083
[seething]

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.375
Why, you rotten--

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:51.250
Take it back!
Take it back now!

00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:52.208
I'm gonna rip--

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.667
[KAZUMA]
This is going nowhere.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:56.125
[AQUA]
KonoSuba!

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.042
Mmm!

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.250
Oh, by the way,

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.375
I heard how you
and your party defeated Verdia.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:08.625
You know,
he was quite the swordsman.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.292
Why, even among
the other generals,

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:12.583
his skills were second
to none.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.208
I'm shocked you beat him.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.542
Do all you undead folks
know each other,

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:17.958
'cause it sounds to me
like you knew him.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.625
Well, to tell you
the truth,

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:22.875
I'm one of the eight generals
of the Devil King.

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:24.750
-Gotcha!
-[yelps]

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:26.833
Wait, Lady Aqua! Please!

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.042
I can explain!

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.917
Don't do anything hasty!
Please, listen!

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.500
Phew! I did it, I got her!

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.083
Now I can pay off
all my debts!

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.333
I might even get
some change back!

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.000
Come on, Aqua, ease up.

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:41.333
We should hear
what she's got to say.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.667
Sorry about this

00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:46.208
but if what you say is true,
we can't ignore it.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.333
If you're with the Devil King,
you're a threat to us.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.667
No, I'm not!
I maintain the magic barrier

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:53.167
that protects the
Devil King's castle, is all!

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:56.542
I've never hurt anyone, so I can
barely be considered a general!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.167
In fact, I'm so harmless,

00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:00.583
no one's even bothered
to put a bounty on me!

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.208
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.292
[BOTH sigh]

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:05.958
Can't be too careful
with the undead,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.417
so I'll kill you
just to be safe.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.583
Please, Lady Aqua!
Have mercy!

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:10.458
[AQUA]
Ko!

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.792
[KAZUMA]
No-Su-Ba?!

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.000
So let me get this straight.

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:19.042
You're saying, even if we kill
the Devil King's other generals,

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:20.500
we can't get
into his castle?

00:07:20.542 --> 00:07:23.333
Yes, that's right!
There's no way you could!

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.292
You wouldn't get
through the barrier!

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:27.083
Even though I'm one
of his generals,

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.917
I love my shop
and my life here.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.917
All he wanted was for me
to maintain the barrier

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.208
and keep my identity
a secret.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.083
Uh-huh. So basically, as long
as you're still alive,

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:37.958
humans can't invade
his castle.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.875
Yeah. Kazuma,
let's kill this lich.

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:43.083
No, don't!
Please, I beg you!

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.375
Don't kill me yet. Let me live
a little while longer!

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:49.208
I still have so much left
to do before I go.

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:53.917
Huh! If I let you live, I'm sure
I could break your barrier.

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.417
But it would be so much easier
if I killed you.

00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.750
No! Please, don't!

00:07:57.792 --> 00:07:59.000
-Hold your horses.
-[AQUA] Hmm?

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:00.417
No one's killing anyone,

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.000
'cause even if the barrier
was gone,

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:04.667
we're not ready to take down
the Devil King yet.

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:06.583
We'd all just get
our heads cut off.

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.000
Humph, fine, whatever.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.458
Th-thank you so much
for sparing me!

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.750
Are you cool with us?
Even though we,

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.167
you know, killed Verdia?

00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.875
Oh, I don't have
a problem with you,

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.792
if I understand you correctly.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.083
He and I weren't very close.

00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:24.708
Whenever he'd see me...

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.292
-[VERDIA] Whoopsie!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.208
-My head slipped!
-[WIZ gasps]

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.542
[laughing]

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.083
[WIZ] ...he'd roll his head
down the hall at me

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.708
and peek up my skirt.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.750
For a Dullahan,
he could be so childish.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.750
[VERDIA]
Strike, baby! Whoo!

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.208
Don't worry.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.250
Even though I'm one
of the undead,

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:51.750
my heart is still
very much human.

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:54.000
This half's my half!

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.750
If you're ready,
I'd be happy

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:57.875
to teach you
one of my skills now.

00:08:57.917 --> 00:08:59.750
It's the least I can do
to repay you

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:01.958
for having mercy on me
at the cemetery.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.750
-Wait.
-Wait for what?

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:07.417
Um, I'll need someone
to stand in for an opponent,

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:09.292
so I can show you
how it's done.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.750
What do you say, Aqua?
You wanna help us out with this?

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.625
Yeah, sure.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:15.667
But I wanna know what skill
this undead wants

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:17.083
to use on me first.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.833
Oh I, um, I wanted
to show him "Drain Touch."

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:22.833
It's a skill that absorbs
an opponent's health

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.125
and magical energy

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.417
and lets the user
transfer them

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:26.625
to anyone they want.

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.375
That sounds awesome.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.958
And depending on how I use it,
it might even pick up the slack

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.625
in our party's lack
of firepower.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:34.833
I-I won't take much energy
from you!

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.792
Just a little bit, I promise!

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:37.875
Hmm?

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.833
Oh, whatever. You can take
as much as you want.

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:45.167
Be my guest.

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:47.083
[KAZUMA]
So, uh,

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:49.792
who's supposed to be
the bad guy here again?

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:52.500
O-okay.
H-here we go, then.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.083
Oh, wait,
something's not right.

00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:59.792
Oh no, is everything okay?

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.208
Is the big, bad lich having
a hard time absorbing?

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.750
What's going on?

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:06.167
Ow!

00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:07.667
What's your problem, Kazuma?!

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.833
Can't you see
there's a battle between

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:10.375
a lich and a goddess
over here!

00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:12.583
I can't let her take my energy
without a fight!

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.417
We don't got all day,
so quit being an ass

00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:15.500
and let her drain you.

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:16.458
[AQUA]
Ko!

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500
[KAZUMA]
NoSuba!

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:19.833
[KAZUMA]
Here goes.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:25.750
[gasps]

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:38.583
I can't wait
to try this out!

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:40.792
-[WIZ] U-um, Lady Aqua?
--Uh--

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:42.333
I'm done using my skill,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.292
so you can let go
of my hand now.

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.667
To tell you the truth,
when you touch me,

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:48.375
it sort of makes
my hand tingle,

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.708
so it would be great
if you could let go of it!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.333
[giggles]

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.500
[WIZ]
Lady Aqua...

00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:57.250
Don't do that.
It's making my hand burn!

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:59.625
No, please don't!
I'll disappear, I'll disappear!

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:01.750
-I don't want to disappear!
-Ow!

00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:04.583
Why you gotta be such
a big bully? Leave her alone!

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:05.875
[sighs]

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:07.333
You're such a meanie!

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.083
[KAZUMA]
I hate to say this, Wiz,

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.500
but I can sorta see
through you now.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:14.000
-[door opens]
-[MAN] Sorry for barging in!

00:11:14.042 --> 00:11:15.833
I need your help, Lady Wiz!

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:18.042
[WIZ]
KonoSuba!

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:24.083
[gate clanking]

00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:27.458
Well, this is it.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:30.708
This'll do.
Oh yes! This will do nicely!

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.708
This is a perfect home
for a goddess of my caliber.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.500
It's big. I heard it used
to belong to some aristocrat.

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:39.292
The landlord is
certainly generous,

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.292
letting us live here
after we have exorcized

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.000
the evil spirits from it.

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:44.375
You know what I found out?

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.458
Wiz has this rep
for being a great mage.

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:49.292
If someone's got a problem
with a ghost,

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:50.875
they go talk to her.

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.417
This big, warm house
is our ticket

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.333
to surviving
this freezing winter!

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:56.958
Exorcizing a couple of ghosts
will be a cinch for me.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.292
They are good as gone!

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:00.333
But the dude said
whenever others tried

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.250
to exorcize this place,
it never worked.

00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:03.542
The ghosts kept coming back.

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:04.833
Right, but I'm both
a goddess

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:05.917
and an arch-priest,

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.417
so this time
it'll be different!

00:12:07.458 --> 00:12:10.375
I'm an all-around
anti-undead expert!

00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:12.375
[inhales deeply]

00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:13.375

[ALL]
Aah!

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:17.958
Yes! I see it clear now!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.167
There was a child.

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:20.833
She was the product
of a casual affair

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:23.042
between the lord
of this house and a maid.

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:25.125
To avoid scandal,
she was locked up here.

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:27.208
-[ALL groan]
-[AQUA] The lord was a frail man

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.250
who died from
some mysterious illness,

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.333
and the maid disappeared
soon after.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.750
Their child lived alone
in this empty mansion,

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:36.250
wandering the halls,
until she, too, died--

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:37.833
Sounds to me like
someone's read

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.375
way too many gothic
romance novels.

00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:43.167
[hooting]

00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:46.500
[sighs]

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:48.500
I think that's enough cleaning
for one day.

00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:51.792
We each picked out our rooms,
our bags have been unpacked.

00:12:51.833 --> 00:12:53.292
Now, to wait for the ghost.

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.208
How about we let some
fresh air in this place.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.208
...Anna Filante Estheroid

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.083
and her favorite things
were her dolls

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:02.208
and listening to stories about
adventurers and their journeys.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.333
No, we're not dealing
with an evil spirit here,

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:05.583
just a lonely girl.

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:07.792
Oh wait! She liked
playing grown-up in life

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:09.708
and misses doing that
most of all!

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.208
We should break out
the liquor and offer--

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.250
Yeah, I'm pretty tired, so I
think I'm gonna hit the sack.

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:17.375
If you guys see
any ghosts around, holler!

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:19.500
Good night!

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:23.875
[sighs]

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:28.667
Aw, yeah! I love having
my own room again!

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:31.708
I bet by morning,
all the ghosts will be gone.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.000
Aqua's not the type to let

00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:35.625
some evil spirit screw around
in her house.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.250
She'd kick their ass out
before they could say, "boo".

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:40.625
She's an arch-priest
and a goddess, after all!

00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:44.500

The super expensive booze
I was saving's gone. Vanished!

00:13:58.292 --> 00:14:00.750
The only thing I was looking
forward to after my bath

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:02.792
was relaxing
and having a few sips.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.917
But then,
when I got back to my room,

00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.125
it was lying
on the floor, empty!

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:09.625
That's a bummer.
Okay, going back to bed now.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.125

Evil spirits did this!

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.750
I'm going to go through

00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.667
Honestly, didn't you know
this was Aqua's room?

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.792
Yeah, I knew, so what are
you doing here?

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.833
Uh, I, um--

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.667
A-a bunch of dolls started
moving around in my room.

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:56.750
So I, uh,
I came to see

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:58.917
if Aqua would walk
with me down the hall.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:04.500
You know, to stand guard
outside the bathroom.

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:05.458
[AQUA[
Copycat!

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:08.542
If Aqua ain't here,
then she's probably out

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:10.250
exorcizing ghosts.

00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:13.583
Probably. I have a feeling
Darkness is with her, too.

00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:14.958
[nervous chuckle]

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.417
That makes sense.
She is a crusader, after all--

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.958
Ow!

00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:22.708
Hey, Megumin?
[wincing]

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.250
Do me a favor and turn around
and cover your ears for a bit.

00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:27.917
I'm gonna go out
on the balcony and--

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.750
Okay, what's the big deal?
Come on, let go.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:34.250
Seriously, I'm like two seconds
away from hosing down the room.

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.250
I'm not letting go of you.

00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:39.333
Who knows what will happen
if you go out there alone?

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:41.875
And besides,
we're in the same party!

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:43.583
We stick together
wherever we go.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.125
Even to the bathroom!

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:47.958
No, let me go!

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.542
The ally-rule don't apply
when a guy's gotta pee!

00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:53.667
Urk! What happened to Crimson
Demons not using the bathroom?!

00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.875
If you really gotta go, there's
an empty bottle right there!

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:59.375
Are you suggesting what I think
you're suggesting?!

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:01.833
That's the ickiest thing
I ever heard in my life!

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.208
All I'm trying to do
is protect you,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.667
so stop fighting me!

00:17:04.708 --> 00:17:06.167
I swear I'm not going
to peek.

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:07.667
I'll just stand guard
while you take care

00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:09.417
of your business.

00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:10.625
[squeaks]

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.542
[BOTH screaming]

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.292
[MEGUMIN]
KonoSuba!

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:26.792
[KAZUMA panting]]

00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:29.167
[MEGUMIN]
A-are you still out there?

00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.292
Yeah, I'm here.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.667
[MEGUMIN] A-are you sure
you're still there?

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:34.708
I said I'm here!

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.875
[MEGUMIN]
But is that really you?!

00:17:35.917 --> 00:17:37.250
H-how do I know
you're not a ghost!

00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:38.667
Oh my god!

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.292
Would you hurry up,
or I'm gonna piss myself

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.625
to death
and come back and haunt you!

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.083
It's embarrassing
sitting here in all this quiet.

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.417
Could you sing something?
The louder, the better.

00:17:48.458 --> 00:17:50.250
No way in hell
am I gonna stand out here

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:51.375
in the middle of the night

00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:53.167
singing songs
outside the crapper!

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:55.000

-[KAZUMA] Open up, open up!
-[MEGUMIN yelps]

00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:01.625
Don't scare me like that!

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.375
I know, I know, you need to go,
but you'll just have to wait!

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.000
[KAZUMA]
This ain't about that anymore!

00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:08.750
We got a bigger problem
than busted bladders out here!

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:10.625
Stop pounding
on the door already!

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.250
I can't go if you rush me!

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:14.375
Holy hell, they're coming!

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:16.625
Open up, dammit!

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:20.958
[screaming]

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.083
We're leaving!

00:18:24.417 --> 00:18:26.625
[MEGUMIN] You pulled me
out of there half-naked!

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:29.917
Oh, stop your whining!
At least you got to go pee!

00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.875
Like I've said before,
Crimson Demons do not go pee!

00:18:32.917 --> 00:18:34.542
Yeah, whatever!

00:18:34.583 --> 00:18:37.250
I gotta go so bad right now,
I'm ready to puke!

00:18:37.292 --> 00:18:40.250
I thought that would happen,
so I brought this along.

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:42.875
-Want to use it now?
-Wh-why, you little--

00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:45.875

[whimpering]

00:18:51.167 --> 00:18:53.667
Dammit! I can't hold it in,

00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:55.500
and this vase ain't
gonna be big enough...

00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:57.333
[MEGUMIN]
Darkness blacker than black.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:58.667
Darker than dark.

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:01.917
Come unto me and combine
with my deep crimson.

00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.333
Shut up, you idiot!

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.750
You wanna blow us up
with the dolls?!

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:06.458
[door thudding]

[thudding continues]

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.958
Crap, we'll have
to make a run for it!

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.583
When I open the door,
you haul ass, you got it?!

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.833
I'll use my Drain Touch on 'em,
and with a little luck,

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:18.542
I'll suck out their magic
and clear a path

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:19.583
out of here for us!

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.708
[grunts]

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.333
Bring it on,
you evil bitches!

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:24.542
Here we come!

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.083
And after I get
through with you,

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.583
I'll sic our goddess
on y'all!

My goodness, Aqua!
Are you alright?!

-[DARKNESS] KonoSuba!
- [AQUA] Yay! Yay!

00:19:39.708 --> 00:19:41.917
As thanks for getting rid
of those ghosts,

00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.708
we have a special reward
for you.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.333
You've done the town
a great service.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.792
The Guild was
at their wits end,

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:49.167
because every time
someone tried

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.625
to exorcize that house,
more ghosts appeared.

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:53.375
Yeah, I heard,
but what's so special

00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:55.625
about that place that
all the ghosts went there?

00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:57.583
Well, it's not the house.

00:19:57.625 --> 00:20:00.000
Actually, the issue
has something to do

00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:01.458
with the graveyard.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.167
Oh yeah,
it's right nearby.

00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:06.125
Are we talking about
the same one we met Wiz at?

00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:07.458
[LUNA]
It seems someone erected

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.875
a massive magical barrier
around it as a prank.

00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:12.375
The spirits had nowhere to go

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:15.250
and since the house was empty,
they settled in there.

00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:16.750
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:18.375
Excuse us for a sec!

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:24.292
[KAZUMA] If you know
what's going on, tell me. Now.

00:20:25.292 --> 00:20:28.167
Uh, you, uh, remember
we promised Wiz

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.250
-I'd exorcize the graveyard?
-[KAZUMA] Yeah.

00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:32.375
Well, doing that meant
I'd have to go out there

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:34.167
-every single night, you know?
-[KAZUMA] Yeah.

00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.292
I thought it'd be way easier
to just block them

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:37.875
from gathering there
in the first place.

00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:40.333
Then they'd get bored
waiting around and leave.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.583
So I, you know, did...

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.708
[KAZUMA] We got paid
'cause this knucklehead

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.708
cleaned up a mess she made?!

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:50.708
I don't have to tell you
why we can't take

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.167
the reward for this,

00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.458
-do I?
-Uh-uh.

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:55.292
[AQUA/KAZUMA]
KonoSuba!

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:01.375
I thought Aqua was pulling
our legs about you.

00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:04.000
I had no idea she could do
stuff like that.

00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:05.083
[WIZ]
Hello, Kazuma.

00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:06.625
It's so gracious of you

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.542
to clean her headstone.

00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:09.958
I heard the news.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.375
It's great
the landlord's letting you stay!

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.625
Yeah, tell me about it,

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:15.667
especially after all the trouble
we caused him,

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:17.583
and the trouble
we caused you, too.

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:20.458
[WIZ] Well, in the end,
it turned out for the best,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.542
for everyone.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.458
Now that you're all here,
she won't be lonely.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.208
[giggles]

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.833
No, she won't.

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:31.750
Hey, Anna? Please don't
cause us any more trouble.

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:34.792
[WIZ] Well, I should get back
to the shop now.

00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.250
Give the others
my regards, won't you?

00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:39.042
You got it.
Thanks for coming by!

00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:44.417
[chuckles]

00:21:44.458 --> 00:21:45.958
[AQUA]
Kazuma!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.542
Lunch is ready,
so get washed up!

-Hurry!

00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:52.250
[AQUA] If it gets cold,
it's not my fault!

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:55.792
Finally, I had myself
the kind of life I wanted

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:58.375
since I first dropped
into this world.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:01.125
Okie-dokie!
Be right there!

00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:04.167
[DARKNES] Aqua. We need
more wood for the fireplace.

00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:07.917
[AQUA] Oh. You can just toss
Kazuma's old tracksuit in there!

00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.333
No!

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:11.417
Quit trying to burn
my tracksuit!

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:13.917
What did it ever do
to you?!

00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.833
[DARKNESS] A knight
must not lose composure

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:48.458
over trivial things.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.833
They must stand fast,

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.917
no matter how absurd
the situation.

with obscene--
