Course ahead is all green.
Proceeding with operation.

been spotted! Fall back now!

[NORRIS] Get to the tunnel
before the shelling starts.

17
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,910
We've got 'em! We have
the coordinates to their base!

I can't believe how many planes
are up there. They've reshaped
the whole mountain.

[ELEDORE] Right!

We'll be going by the book.
10 shots &amp; then we move out.

I'm ready. Let's do it.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,300
That was a direct hit. Their
gunners are good.

25

You think we can hold them off?
We don't have much left
to fight with.

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,310
Don't worry kid. The Apsalus
will be finished very soon &amp;
besides that we already have

27
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,310
plans for the Kergeren's escape.
Ms. Aina's making sure everyone
makes it to safety.

I bet we're going
back to Side 3!

[NORRIS] Abandoning a base. The
final sign of a

[FED] Preparations to blow the
tunnel entrance are complete.

31

We've blown the shutters &amp; are
now sending Kojima's

Switching to hard line.

[PILOT] No sign of the enemy.

[PILOT 2] Looks like they're
flooding the area with
Minovsky particles.

Pull back the GMs until the

already had 9 units blown up.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But we've only lost 6 sir.

The count is not the point here.

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,756
Commander. I expected you to
understand our purpose here.

43
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,000
Since we can't find
a way in,

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
what what would you say to
making the mountain
disappear altogether?

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,050
That could get ugly sir. We'd
have to use nuclear weapons.

in love. I am a little envious.

84
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,340
I was born with feelings too
although it might be a little
hard to believe. Yes I used

85
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,500
to have them before I
became a professional soldier.

86
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,200

father Norris. Though I know
so little about you.

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,200
As a father?! You really think
of me that way? What an honor.

out there.

life is about the things they've
accomplished. Master Ginias

91
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,110
has made his dreams come true &amp;
that's commendable. If you
want the Kergeren to

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,110
escape and there's a way I can
help, then as a soldier it's my
duty to find a way to make

93
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,210
that happen. You watch Ms. Aina
I'm going to make sure there's

He's coming right for ya!

All green! The
Apsalus is complete.

It's been a long and very
difficult journey.
And I thank you.

afraid! Die knowing you lost to
someone who really

169
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,400
knows how to use a mobile suit!

goodbye to your tank.

Well Ms. Aina the Kergeren
will have to leave without me.

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,110
I have found the place
where I am to die.

[SOLDIER] Ms. Aina! We just
spotted a signal flare from
Captain Norris!

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,820
How is he? Tell me what
color was the flare?!

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,940
It was red.

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,170
Unable to return. Launch
the Kergeren now.

Yes ma'am.

liftoff! Cutting energy
pipes to the base now.

Gentlemen, while it pains me to
say goodbye to you all
the time has come.

Relax and get some rest.

And now the Apsalus is mine.
And mine alone!

191
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:22,220
The Kergeren is due to take off
in about 20 minutes. I better
throw in a few more tricks!

192
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,970
Out of ammo?!

193
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,820
My left arm is out of action!

194
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:04,680
Ha! Pretty good reflexes. Not
bad for a Feddie. But I bet
you're not ready for this!

Your good vision is your
fatal weakness!

Where's the main
circuit damn it!?

197

Why don't you shoot?!

owe you one.

[GUNTANK] Right!

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
[SANDERS] So what do
we do now "acting commander?"

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,300
[KAREN] If we could just
get to the weapons depot...

203
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,800
No way he got the Guntanks when
we tried it! Make sure blue boy
stays off the tank.

games with them. What'll it be?
You gonna fire on me while the

[SANDERS] Right!

Come on hands. Stay steady. My
friends! Unit 301? Do I really
care if they get out of

209
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,220
this alive? Right now all that
fighting for my friends talk is
sounding ridiculous!

The Commander! He's lost it.

216
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,800
Yeah once he stops thinking
about it he'll be a force
to reckon with.

217
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,300
I think he'll be OK.
