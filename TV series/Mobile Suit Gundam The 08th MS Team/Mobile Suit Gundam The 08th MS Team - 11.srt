your brother.

153
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,400
Right. We'll just forget
about them for now.

154
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Alright lower! Lower and stop!

155
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,960
[SHIRO] OK! Go ahead!

156
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,080
Wow even at the lowest setting
these sabers are powerful!

157
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,280
Using a beam weapon to
make warm water...

158
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,600
I've never met anyone with so
many strange ideas!

159
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,000
[SHIRO] Oh. Ah...

160
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,000
Feels like pins and needles.

161
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,720
Sure it does. But you'll feel
better once the blood
flow returns.

162
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Now my feet are numb. Say you
want in on the bath here?

163
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,480
[NORRIS] Refuel the Dopps! And
prepare to launch for
another search.

164
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,840
[MAN] Captain Norris! Urgent
news! It's Odessa...
we've lost it.

165
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,320
We're going to recover soldiers
from the northern line.

166
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,080
Put base security on full alert.

167
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
Right!

168
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,480
Once again the battle
lines have changed.

169
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,480
You can open your eyes.

170
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,880
My heart is racing.

171
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,040
So is mine.

172
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,360
[GIGGLES]

173
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,760
You know you're very
pretty. Just like a living doll.

174
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
[LAUGHING]

175
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,240
Hello big brother!

176
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,360
[GINIAS] Aina become my arms.
Become my legs.

177
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,440
[SHIRO] Aina? Aina?

178
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Shiro!

179
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:55,200
I am not... I am not just a doll
for Ginias to play with!

180
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,320
I get all this way and now I
run into Feddies?

181
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,480
[GUNFIRE]

182
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,680
You know what I wish for? I
wish that you and I

183
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,040
could be the last two people
left in the whole world.

184
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,280
One day. We'll be
together again.

185
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,240
[EXPLOSION]

186
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,000
What are they doing?

187
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,640
There is no reason
for us to fight!

188
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,800
[GUNFIRE]

189
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,480
[PILOT] We've sighted the
enemy prototype!

190
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,000
They're fighting the
same war we've been fighting.

191
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,080
[GUNFIRE]

192
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,640
Stop it!!

193
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Do you want to kill yourself?!
Well do you?

194
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,160
Sure why not Aina? This
is our war too.

195
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,160
And if this is our war
then what hope is there for us?

196
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,600
[EXPLOSION]

197
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,600
[EXPLOSION]

198
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Get down there and recover her
while you can! The Feddies
have another plane

199
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
in the vicinity!

200
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,360
[TAKEOFF]

201
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,680
So what about that Feddie pilot?

202
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
[AINA] Eliminated.

203
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,160
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

204
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,480
[ENDING THEME]

205
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,650
[SHIRO] Next episode: My
encounter with Aina in the
blizzard seems like a dream. But

206
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,160
after I make it home I find a
military tribunal waiting to
question me. They

207
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,700
think I'm a Zeon spy! Then they
put me under house arrest just
as Kiki's village is

208
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,800
attacked by the Zeon! The
Federal Forces won't help them
so it's up to me. They may be

209
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,600
guerrillas but they're
also my friends!

210
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Next time on Mobile Suit Gundam:
The 08TH MS Team –
Duty and Ideals.
