big to be full.

of this base until the 08th

Where can I find Lt. Nickard?
‐Still on his lunch break sir.

Ah! Dumb shit watch where you're

got some mail while you
were out on patrol.

Go over to HQ and get it.
But I was hoping for some stew!

I said go get it!

in a village to the
west of our base.

me. I'll go alone if I have to!

stay here until...

luck finally rubbed off on me &amp;
you could care less.

44
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:17,057
I do care but I'm kinda worried
about getting in trouble when
the Commander finds out

45
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:17,498
about it.

46

when the money starts
rolling in don't come

gonna

with this thing?

needed it to complete an

soon as we can.

through.

been seen on base since they
last reported in.

from there now.

it's a violation of orders.

out where they are. Karen you

[ELEDORE] My arm!

291
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:38,018
Relax! You'll find it's still
connected. Both of them are.
What're you doing?!

292
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:45,826
Goddess for sure.

293
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:55,275
[SHIRO] Don't worry Eledore.
You'll be fine.

294
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:59,419
Now you behave yourself in the
hospital with all
those nurses OK?

295
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,421
Hey nurses sound good!

296
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,204
That's exactly what I was
worried about.

297
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:07,528
By the way pal you're
only alive because of Karen.

298
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,770
Shall I give your
regards to Karen?

299
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,935
Why would a cold‐blooded woman
like her care? Alright it's
time to go Commander.

300
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:19,339
Right. OK then Lt. Nickard
the patient is all yours.

301
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,843
I'll take care of him.
Here we go!

302
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,465
[ELEDORE] See you guys!

303
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:29,469
Eledore! You get well soon
and hurry back OK?

304
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:35,475

[SHIRO] The 08th team arrives in
the perfect spot to ambush the
new Zeon monster. We hold

307
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:34,955
our position day after day
watching our trap and all we can
do is wait. But the harsh

308
00:24:34,955 --> 00:24:40,961
environment and the endless
waiting is putting us all on
edge. Snap out of it guys!

309
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:45,966
We need teamwork for this
plan to succeed.
