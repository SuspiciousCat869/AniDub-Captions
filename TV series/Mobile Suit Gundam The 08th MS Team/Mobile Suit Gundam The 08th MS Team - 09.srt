they're planning to use
their new weapon

headquarters?

[MAN] Yes. According to

managed to gather sir.

I think Revil's Antarctic Treaty
may have backfired on us.

Captain are you certain you made
the right decision by
deploying the 08th team?

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Because of Shiro Amada?

25
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,340
If his friendship with the
enemy is that deep,

26
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,160
we may be able to make use of
it to find out more.

27
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,780
But what if he betrays us?

28
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't worry. I have him under
close observation.

Yes sir.

[SHIRO] After we make the
drop at point alpha,

33
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,620
we'll proceed to point beta
while we search for the enemy.

34
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,300
We'll rendezvous with the Medea
which will bring us
back to base.

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,980
Now the purpose behind this
operation is specifically to
find the enemy base.

36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,920
Gathering intelligence is
paramount. We have to do all we
can to avoid combat.

[MICHEL] You mean we
don't have to fight?

I guess that means if your
girlfriend comes out we don't
have to hurt her.

Of all the bum luck! The women
in the hospital were all fat.
Bleargh.

You never saw women this big, it
was all I had to choose from.

Meanwhile you managed to get

We're aware of that sir.

154
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,420
Just look after the
safety of the men.

155
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,540
Get 'em back into space Okay?

156
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,220
You're good soldiers. Alright
Magella attack force
let's move out!

157
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,340
Sir!

158
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,960
[ELEDORE] Come on! Don't be mad.
Gimme a break!

159
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,420
Uh the beam rifle cannon
should be operational now!

160
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,280
[KAREN] I've got
video on my scope.

161
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,340
[ELEDORE] Tell ya what! I'll
treat you to a dinner when my
song royalties come in!

162
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,560
Everyone listen up! We're
changing the plan a little bit.

163
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,400
[SHIRO] Karen &amp; the hover truck
will head for the
rendezvous point.

164
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,560
Sanders &amp; I will carry
out the mission.

165
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,000
We'll be in a lot of trouble if
we run into a fight
along the way.

166
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,480
Let's hope that doesn't happen.

167
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,900
[SHIRO] But if it does, run!

168
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,380
[ELEDORE] Maybe we could come up
with a better plan?

169
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,600
Great plan!

170
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,120
[KAREN] I'll use my state of the
art mobile suit to run away as
fast as I possibly can.

171
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,180
Ah forgive me for
having to ask you for help.

172
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,620
Well I know a bit about
medicines I might as well.

173
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,000
Thank you very much.

174
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,240
Can I help you with some
of that ma'am?

175
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,280
That's alright. I've got it.
You get some rest.

176
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,780
Wait that looks heavy.

177
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,620
[MAN] I... I'm sorry.

178
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,780
No. Is this what
you're giving them?

179
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,650
Yes.

180
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,660
And you have the nerve to call
yourself a doctor?

181
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,560
We have no other options if we
wish to finish the
Apsalus on time.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,840
My brother put you up to this!

183
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,720
No. It was my decision to make.
I am not without a conscience.

184
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,650
However I am also a professional
soldier who is fighting a war

185
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:19,660
for the independence
of the colonies

186
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,800
and will do whatever is
necessary.

187
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,500
With the Apsalus we'll be able
to hit the enemy's headquarters.

188
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,520
And to make that happen as a
soldier I feel certain
sacrifices have to be made.

189
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,080
[AINA] So Ginias is ignoring the
order to stop work. I
have to stop him.

190
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,020
[MAN] Looks like you've managed
to convert the Rick Dom
generator successfully sir.

191
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,900
[GINIAS] Of course. Cut phases
7, 8, and 9 out of the project.

192
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,880
Increase the
construction efforts.

193
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,160
Admiral Yuri is requesting
evacuation support.

194
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,860
Support? And risk revealing
the location of this facility?

195
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,680
But we can't stand by &amp; let
our people be killed.

196
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,580
So let him deal with the
evacuation himself.

197
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,265
Sir you're forgetting the
lives of the brave men

198
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,300
who've made the long march from
Odessa to make it to this place.

199
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,080
That's irrelevant. Nothing is
more important than the
Apsalus being completed.

200
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Damn! Ginias are you really
going to abandon
your own forces?

201
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,000
I'll find a way to get us
back into space no matter what.

202
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm counting on you
Magella attack team.

203
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,740
Uh commander?

204
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
What? The enemy?

205
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,720
Something like that.

206
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,160
[SANDERS] The truth is I've been
ordered to keep an
eye on you sir.

207
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,500
I've broken too many
regulations huh?

208
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,060
[SHIRO] Don't worry about it
Sanders.
‐Oh. Good.

209
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,380
I knew Kojima would do
something like this eventually.

210
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,380
It wasn't him. It was Captain
Ryer who asked me to do it.

211
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,360
It was Captain Ryer.

212
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,240
Some of the men from the
inquiry must still not trust me.

213
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,280
Mines now active!

214
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,220
Now I wonder if the
Federation will ever trust me?

215
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,640
[SANDERS] We've got battle
wreckage 2 clicks ahead.

216
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,620
Multiple metallic
objects detected.

217
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,140
[SHIRO] Perfect place for a
trap. Let's double back
into the forest.

218
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,420
[SHIRO] Sanders pull back!

219
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,920
[CPT.] HEAT ammo on the one
with the horns! Fire!

220
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,660
Hit his ventilator next! And
finish off the one in front.
Fire!

221
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,260
[SANDERS] Pulling back!

222
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,140
[SHIRO] Sanders!

223
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,340
Keep it up! Fire at
will full barrage.

224
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,980
He's locked on us! Let's
get out of here!

225
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,480
[SHIRO] My optical sensors!

226
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,980
[CPT.] Barry! Lunen! Formation
A! Once the smoke clears
we'll settle things.

227
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,260
But first a little psychological
warfare. Federation mobile suit!

228
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,100
[SHIRO] That voice!
You're the captain of that Gau!

229
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,100
[CPT.] Captain Bjorn Abust.
I have a question for you.

230
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Why didn't you fire on our
Gau when you had the chance?

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,460
[SHIRO] What?!

232
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,760
My men &amp; I were very
appreciative. But I don't
share your weakness.

233
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,320
We are a proud people &amp; we
haven't much use for
Federation mercy or pity.

234
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,060
[SHIRO] I just wanted to avoid
any more needless deaths.

235
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,800
[CPT.] Is that why you were
about to shoot me down?
I thought so.

236
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,980
Our men are suffering too much.
Please stop the Apsalus project.

237
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,900
And after that what happens?

238
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,780
Maybe you were planning on
stopping this war all
by yourself?

239
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,760
Hardly Ginias. However we both
know you received orders to
stop construction.

240
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,920
Giving the men drugs so
they can keep working is wrong.

241
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,600
Very touching. Unfortunately we
happen to be fighting a war.

242
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
The Apsalus will be completed.
And I'll get the order
rescinded if I have to.

243
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,500
[YURI] Hurry! Move!

244
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,320
[MAN] Sir! What about you?

245
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,640
My place is right here. I'm not
going in until my men get back.

246
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,000
[SANDERS] Commander!

247
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,360
[SHIRO] Sanders? You Okay?

248
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,240
[SANDERS] My left leg is
broken. I can't help you.

249
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,740
How bad is the wound?
Are you bleeding?

250
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,080
[SANDERS] I meant the
mobile suit's leg sir.

251
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,140
[SHIRO] I forgot the most
important thing.

252
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,020
So you're really gonna shoot
this time?
[SHIRO] Yeah!

253
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,750
[GUNFIRE]

254
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,420
Everyone fall back while firing.
That's enough. We've got
plenty of time!

255
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,980
[CPT.] Don't get killed now!

256
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,740
We're getting pretty good
at falling back while firing.

257
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,860
Well after all it is what we've
been doing all the
way from Odessa.

258
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,920
Good. Now let's finish this Fed.

259
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,840
[SHIRO] I won't fight for the
Federation but I'll sure as hell
fight to save my friends!

260
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
You've had a change of heart?
I don't buy it!

261
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,250
[GUNFIRE]

262
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,850
[EXPLOSION]

263
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,300
[LAUGHTER]

264
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,750
Eh?

265
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,300
Well we made it back Admiral.
Unfortunately we lost the fight.

266
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,620
I'm glad you made it back.
Very glad.

267
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,420
[MAN] Where is everyone? They
all made it inside.
Thanks to you.

268
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,280
[MAN] Now let's get back into
space.

269
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,280
[MAN 2] I'll bet a fat‐ass like
you prefers zero g.

270
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,240
Oh you're one to talk.
‐Oh come on lighten up.

271
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,700
[MAN] Hey what's going on?
[MAN 2] What the hell? Shit!

272
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,380
[GINIAS] Well Rear
Admiral Yuri Kellanay.

273
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,540
Let us in Ginias!

274
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,660
Your private secretary has
told me all of your plans.

275
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,180
What have you done to Cynthia?

276
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,770
[GINIAS] I found out Commandant
Giren doesn't know yet

277
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,740
that you've ordered us to
stop construction.

278
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,713
That means if you perish on
the battlefield

279
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:23,140
the Commandant will never find
out the Apsalus was
to be scrapped.

280
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,160
Run for it! Get out
of this tunnel!

281
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,600
So Admiral Kellanay was
unfortunately killed in action.

282
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,640
Barry! Lunen!

283
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,840
Ginias!!

284
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,100
What was that?

285
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
[ENDING THEME]

286
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,800
[SHIRO] The Federal forces have
found the Zeon base. And now a
full‐scale battle is on.

287
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,340
Suddenly a blue mobile suit
appears. He can take out three
Gundams single‐handedly.

288
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,460
And that can mean only one
thing: He's an ace pilot. One by
one he takes out the Federation

289
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,660
soldiers until... is it my turn
to die too? Perhaps!

290
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,650
Next time: The Shuddering
Mountain ‐ Part One.
