00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:50,871
It smells really weird
here. And all these trees...

4
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:54,511
Yeah. The environment here
can be pretty obnoxious huh?

5
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,601
You'll get over it.

6
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:00,731
It's a big difference from being
in an air conditioned
space colony.

00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,071
[MICHEL] That's for sure.

[SHIRO] Excuse me Chief
what was your name again?

00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,311
Sir! Master CPO Karen Joshua.

10
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:11,851
Well Master CPO Karen Joshua how
long have you been
stationed here?

11
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:16,821
I've been here for 3 months
Commander. Why what about it?

12
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:20,731
Nothing. Just curious that's
all. Very pleased to meet you.

13
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,961
[KAREN] Likewise.

Wow! Look mobile suits!

15
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,401
They're loaded for land action.

00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:43,091
When do I get to get one of
those? They're cool!

19
00:02:54,801 --> 00:03:01,351
Yes welcome. I'm Battalion
Commander Kojima. Please Ensign
relax. Breathe deep.

20
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:06,351
The good news is you don't have
to swallow any more
reprocessed air.

21
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,151
[KOJIMA] God I hate air
conditioning don't you?

22
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:15,251
[MAN] Hey see that officer the
one on the right? I heard he
went after the Zeeks in a Ball!

23
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,051
[MAN 2] Too bad he's got that
team killer in his unit huh?

24
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:24,051
[KOJIMA] I'm sure you've all
heard the reports that the Zeon
have established a secret

25
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:30,051
base in this area. However the
purpose of this factory remains
a mystery. And due to

26
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:36,051
the fact that their first line
of defense is moving into our
area we've decided it's

27
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:42,051
time to make our own move. Our
objective is to break through
their defensive line and

28
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:46,451
hit them with everything we've
got. [GULPS WATER]

29
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,511
[SOLDIER] So which one of them
is Sanders The Reaper huh?

30
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:54,101
I suggest you keep it down. They
might assign you to his unit!

31
00:03:54,101 --> 00:04:00,101
Oh and one more thing. There are
civilians in the jungle as well.
Try not to stir them up.

32
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:07,271
Anyway that's enough of that.
The Chief can help you with any
questions. Right Karen?

33
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,351

34
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:12,651
[ELEDORE] Alright boys move
back make a path!

35
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:16,151
I'm guessing your new
Commander's arrived huh?

36
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,651
[ELEDORE] You got it!

37
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:23,951
So what's this one like?
‐I dunno man I just met him.

38
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,581
I bet you won't be complaining
you're bored anymore...

39
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:34,451
Look at him. Bet he's gone
within a few weeks. Care
to make a wager?

40
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:38,561
Give him a chance
for God's sake!

41
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,311
Alright you're on!

42
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:47,651
We're going out to back up the
06th team. Give me a weapon &amp;
shake a leg on reloading!

43
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:52,851

[SANDERS] Right!

44
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:56,651

The Zeeks aren't gonna

45
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,651
pick a convenient time
to come calling!

Wait Chief! Where's
my mobile suit?

48
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,651
You will be serving as my
support man kid.

49
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:16,451
You'll handle the gun on
that as my assistant.

50

00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:52,021
No. This Gundam is in
impeccable shape Chief Joshua.

Before we move out our new
Commander has something he'd
like to say to you.

61
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:50,251
I know I haven't had much of a
chance to get to know all of you
and I apologize for that.

62
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:58,651
But whatever happens let's come
back alive. I'll do everything
in my power to make

63
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:05,651
sure each of you makes it back.
I don't want heroics. I want
teamwork. Heroics will get

64
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:11,931
you killed. As your Commander my
job is to make sure we all
survive. And it's my hope that

65
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,471
when victory comes
we're together. That'll be all.

actually knows what he's doing.

it's already hotter than shit.
Ah!

149
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,970
Oh!!

150
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,770
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

151
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,030
Ugh! What the hell are these?!
Ah!

152
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,750
What's with this place? And they
say there are people who
actually live here.

153
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,210
I don't believe it.

154
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,190
I gotta deal with an
insubordinate CPO, a smart
ass petty officer...

155
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,650
Oh! That's great!

156
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,190
Now I feel alive again!

157
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,950
[LAUGHTER]

158
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,320
Whoa. It's a girl. This is good.

159
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,030
Pretty!

160
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,920
[GINIAS] I heard about the
battle you were in 2 days ago.

161
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,770
[AINA] Yes?

162
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,550
The loss of the test unit is
troubling. There was
no alternative?

163
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,450
It was expendable. Wasn't it?

164
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,660
You mean because of the Apsalus?

165
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,170
[AINA] Yes.

166
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,300
The prototype will be
completed very soon.

167
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,150
Then soon it will finally come
true. Your dream big brother.

168
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,300
No. It's not a dream anymore.
Once the Apsalus is on the
battlefield the

169
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,150
advantage in this war
will be ours.

170
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,350
[AINA] I heard Commandant
Giren's speech on my way here.
I'll help any way

171
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,080
I can big brother.

172
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,550
Great. You always manage
to instill some confidence.

173
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,150
The time! Ginias don't forget to
take your medicine just
because I'm here.

174
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,770
[GINIAS] Alright then...

175
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,300
[WATCH BEEPING]

176
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,990
Shut up! Oh...

177
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,200
Hey! I was only just...

178
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,650
[GUNFIRE]

179
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,010
Whoa! Stop that! Stop
shooting! What're you doing?

180
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,150
That looked like a Fed pilot.
Hmm...

181
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,170
There was no reason for her
to open fire on me... huh?

182
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,350
[BIRDS SCATTERING]

183
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,350
The Zaku from last night! He's
just wondering around over
there. Alright...

184
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,150
[KAREN] Sanders! Looks like our
relief is here. How much longer
do we have to wait?

185
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,700
We don't move till we
get orders from the Commander.

186
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,750
Not the most flexible
man are you?

187
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,150
[SANDERS] Let's just say I
owe a personal debt to him.

188
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,250
Or maybe you don't wanna
be the team killer again.

189
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,691
[SANDERS] What?!

190
00:18:55,691 --> 00:19:01,350
Sanders the Reaper. I've seen
your record. You shot down 6
enemy suits with your GM.

191
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,550
[KAREN] If your luck was a
little different you might have
even become an officer.

192
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,224
But I've got the rank in this
unit Sanders so I'll be
giving the orders.

193
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:11,650
[SANDERS] You?!

194
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,000
He said his job was to keep us
alive. Well, we're alive.

195
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,950
One good shot. Just gimme
one good shot. Come on...

196
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,480
Calm down Shiro. Calm down.
Relax.

197
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,550
[SHIRO] Clumsy pilots
have clumsy ways of fighting.

198
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,550
Now quit wandering and
get into my sights. There.

199
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,990
[BEEPING]

200
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,150
I'll show Joshua what I can do.
Just watch.

201
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,950
Alright Shiro. You
can do this...

202
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,900
[GUNFIRE]

203
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,770
He's still fighting?

204
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,350
[SHIRO YELLING]

205
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,480
I did it didn't I? Even here
on the ground...

206
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,750
One enemy down. Now to
get back home.

207
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,830
Hmm!

208
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,270
[MAN] Hey Karen! I hear your
new guy only lasted a day.

209
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,450
[MAN 2] Maybe you shouldn't
have been so rough on him!

210
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,350
[MAN 3] Nah I bet it was the
curse.
[MAN] Ooh the curse!

211
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,950
[MAN 2] The Reaper strikes
again!
[LAUGHTER]

212
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,950
[MICHEL] Dear BB I just arrived
here on Earth &amp; already I've had
my first taste of battle.

213
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,830
I wish you could've seen me
fighting but something awful
happened out there.

214
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,650
Our Commander was separated from
us &amp; never came back. The Earth
can be a harsh place.

215
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,150
And I wonder now if I'm going to
make it through all this alive.

216
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,280
[ELEDORE] Hey kid! He's back!
The newbie's back!

217
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Huh?!!

218
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,590
Commander!

219
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,700
I don't believe it. Will
you look at that?

220
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,500
That's how he was in space!

221
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,810
Did you have anything
more to say about our luck?

222
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,700
Uh‐huh. He oughta be thankful
that mobile suit's so good.

223
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,520
[BEEPING]

224
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,190
Enough already...

225
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,320
[ENDING THEME]

226
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,450
[SHIRO] Our new orders
are handed down.

227
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,450
We have to attack a
Zeon‐occupied village
in the hills.

228
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,850
To take out the enemy's gun
emplacements we split up to
try a pincer attack.

229
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,850
But then I slip up and get
captured by guerrillas. And the
time for the attack

230
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,850
to commence gets closer and
closer. I can't let my
team die like this.

231
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,150
There has to be
something I can do!

232
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,150
Next time on Mobile Suit Gundam
The 08th MS Team: The Time
Limit on Trust.
