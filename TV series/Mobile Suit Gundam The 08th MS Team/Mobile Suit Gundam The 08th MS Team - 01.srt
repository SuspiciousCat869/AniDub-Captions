[SHIRO] You OK Chief?

10
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
Yeah thanks to you. But I've
never had support fire
come that close.

11
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Well at least now you've
seen what I can do.

[SANDERS] Where did that
come from Eledore?

[ELEDORE] Pill box! Top of the

14
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,360
[SANDERS] But why is it so
accurate?

15
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,440
Ah shit! Now they're shooting at
us! The Zekes sure have damn
good ears over there!

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
[MICHEL] Yeah.

[KAREN] Commander!
The enemy fire is thinning out.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
[SANDERS] All units! It looks
like they're moved
in to trap us.

19
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
Shit. They're all around us.

20
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,000
[SHIRO] Team scatter and fall
back. We'll have to
change our strategy.

[ELEDORE] Moving out!

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,640
[SHIRO] OK they've got 3 pill
boxes out front, a trench
covered by Zakus,

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,500
and some nasty hill terrain for
good measure. That's
the highway huh?

24
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes. It's the most vital route
they have for getting
supplies to their forces

25
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
waiting on the front lines.

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,160
[SHIRO] I bet the Federal Forces
could use it too. We could
probably take it

27
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,000
but that village
presents a problem.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,500
[KAREN] Right! We can't let
the Zeeks continue to occupy it.

29
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
[SHIRO] How to attack pill boxes
that use the natural terrain so
well? Wish we could

30
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,240
call in some support for this...

31
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,200
But they'll hunt us down
if we wait for backup to arrive.

32
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah you're right. If only
we could... what's this?

33
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
[KAREN] A waterfall.

34
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,080
[SHIRO] If one of us follow the
river around these hills
we could hit them

35
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,000
with a sneak attack.
[KAREN] Much easier said than
done.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,640
That area is crawling
with guerrillas.

37
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Guerrillas?

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,440
So how do we run this sneak
attack? ‐I've seen the falls
once already so I'll go.

39
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,200
You have sir?
[SANDERS] You'll run the sneak
attack?

40
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,000
The Commander's got the least
experience of all of us
which means he's

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,500
the most expendable right?

42
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Joshua I'm turning over
command of the team to you.

43
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,200
[KAREN] But sir...

44
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,500
No “buts” that's an order.

45
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
[KAREN] Yes sir. Right.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very good. So we'll do it in,
well let's say 3 hours. I want
the team to start its frontal

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,840
assault at that time. I can
definitely be there by then to
start the sneak attack.

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,500
Right. But be aware that without
you we can only hold out an hour
or so against that

49
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,880
kind of heavy fire.

50
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,880
I know that. Chief take the team
through the viaduct beneath the
highway and wait there

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,600
until 1500 hours. At that time
hit the Zeeks with all you got.
That is all.

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Try not to get caught by
the guerrillas.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
[MICHEL] Well I thought the
guerrillas were just civilians.

the ones you gotta
watch out for.

What do you think dad?

150
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
You know there are many sick and
injured people in the village.

151
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,560
You need medicine we'll get it
for you no problem!

152
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,280
On top of that we want the
Zeon to suffer.

153
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,200
Oh we'll make 'em suffer! And
you can have all the war spoils!

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,000
[MAN] Talk's cheap kid!

155
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Still the word of a captured
soldier isn't very reliable.
Is it Kiki?

156
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,300
I think it'll be alright daddy.
Besides he owes me one.

157
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,000
He sure does!

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,500
[MAN] A little one.

159
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
[LAUGHTER]

160
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,920
Very funny you guys are a real
crackup. I'll watch 'em dad. Let
me keep an eye on him. OK?

161
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,720
As if you'd listen to me if I
said no. Ensign for the time
being we will have a truce.

162
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,200
Close call for you pal.

163
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,600
And you better be
thanking the girl!

164
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Kiki I want you to show the
Ensign the way back to
the waterfall.

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,466
[SHIRO] Oh this is great!
There's dirt all over the
controls!

166
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,065
Damn it I don't have time to
clean up all this crap! Ow!

167
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Why'd they beat me up anyway?
It's not like I was
putting up a fight.

168
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,720
Hey are you coming or not?! Get
in! We're running out of time!
Shit.

169
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,700
[KIKI] Any funny business
and I'll plug ya.

170
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,520
Why would I try
anything with a kid?

171
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,000
I bet I'm smarter than you.
[SHIRO] What?

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What is wrong with you?!

173
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey that's not yours!

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I took it fair and square!

175
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You can't have it! This is on
loan from a friend. 3:30?! I
only have a half an hour left!

176
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That thing doesn't really
suit you anyway!

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Now listen...

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
It's Kiki!

179
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
[SHIRO] Kiki?

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,280
[KIKI] Kiki Rosita. That's my
name. Who gave ya the
watch Shiro?

181
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,996
Shiro? What the? Oh kids should
show more respect! And you're
blocking my view!

182
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,560
Come on hang in there guys. Kiki
do you know of any shortcuts?

183
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,900
Following the river
is the fastest.

184
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,500
Alright.

185
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,000
But there's no path!

186
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,160
Eledore any activity
on the hill?

187
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,000
[ELEDORE] Still nothing.

188
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Come on Commander.

189
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,240
How long is he gonna take?!

190
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,450
If they notice us it's all over.

191
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,760
Yeah I know.

192
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,800
[ROCKET FIRE]

193
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,080
He's late! Any sign yet Eledore?

194
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,480
[ELEDORE] Nothing I can confirm.
Uh oh. We got company.

195
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
[MICHEL] What is it? What's
wrong?
[ELEDORE] Quiet!

196
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,960
[KAREN] Is it the Commander? No.
There's 2. Flying.
Headed this way.

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,720
Just great! All units prepare
for an airborne attack!

198
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
[SANDERS] Roger!

199
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
We're having bad luck.
Must be The Reaper's fault.

200
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
[MICHEL] The Reaper?
[ELEDORE] You'll find out.

201
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,000
Captain Norris. Our units on the
ground can easily take care of

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
these foolhardy rats
who've crawled out of hiding.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,750
We can't afford any
more mistakes.

204
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,000
You mean because they beat us
before? Perhaps the Commandant

205
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
was premature in sending you to
inspect us Captain.

206
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,000
[PILOT] And how is Commandant
Ginias? I've heard his sister
Aina has grown into

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,500
a lovely young woman. Eh!
Nevermind.

208
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Well hell this what I get for
trusting that gung‐ho Commander.
Sanders! We're done here.

209
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,200
Fall back under that viaduct.
[SANDERS] But...

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,500
We have no choice!

It is the Commander this time!
There's no doubt about it!

214
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,080
He made it! Now the fun
really begins. We're moving out!

215
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,200

Heh! Sure took him long
enough to get here.

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,000
Any job the Commander
starts he finishes.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,560
Where?

220
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,500
It's coming from over there.
They're attacking
from the river.

221
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
[NORRIS] Shit they got
us surrounded!

222
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,040
Take me to my Zaku.
I'll take 'em out!

223
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
I did it! I blew away
their ammo dump.

224
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,600
You seem surprised about it.
‐Not very. But if you want out
now's the time.

225
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,700
And abandon my job
as protector and guide? No way.

I'm on 'em.

Great they all made it!

Now! Hustle!

[NORRIS] Damn it! Now the
guerrillas are attacking too.

It's only a matter of time
until it falls.

I can hold them off from there.

mobile suit on the west slope.
