[OPENING THEME]

3
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,260
[MAN] Yeah I saw it myself. A
star dropped from the sky and
lit up the whole desert.

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,080
[KIKI] Uh‐huh. So where and
when did you see this star?

5
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,820
I saw it 3 days ago. In a desert
somewhere toward the west.

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Thanks. Shiro we've got a
witness!

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,900
[MAN] Oh my god!

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,820
[SHIRO] Michel! I want you to
contact headquarters and every
team in the area.

9
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,580
Hey! Did you hear me? Michel!

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,620
Yes sir. What is it?

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,200
[SHIRO] Contact headquarters!

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,660
[MICHEL] Yes sir stand by.
OK go ahead.

13
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,140
[SHIRO] The 8th team has
possibly discovered the location
of the Zeon weapons

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,260
testing ground. We're
moving in to confirm. Copy?

BATTLE LINE ON THE BURNING SAND

17
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,020
Ah! Great time to break down.
Listen up guys! My left foot is
screwing up again.

18
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,060
Go on ahead of me.

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,180
[KAREN] Will you be okay
by yourself?

20
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,700
[SHIRO] Yeah Michel and I can
manage.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,780
[KAREN] Roger!

22
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,140
[SANDERS] I don't read
any radiation.

23
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,940
[KAREN] Good!

[KAREN WHISTLING]

25
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,960
[MICHEL] One two pull.
One two pull.

26
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,940
[MICHEL] One two pull. Ah!

27
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,560
Tell me what you see down there!

28
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,060
Right right I'm getting to it.
Ow!

[BREAKING SOUND]

30
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,920
It's glass... it must have been
melted by some sort
of beam weapon.

31
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,770
[GASP]

32
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,980
Commander! This packet is in
bad condition.

33
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,900
The filter seems to be clogged
with a lot of sand.

34
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,720
[MICHEL] Can you get me an M18
filter please?

35
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,880
Yeah I'll bring
you one in just a minute.

36
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,300
[KAREN] Angle of fire indicates
it came from low altitude.

37
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,760
[SHIRO] I'm sure this has to
be some kind of testing ground.

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,680
[KAREN] I Agree!

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,040
[KIKI] See I knew my
informants were right.

40
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,260
Sure looks that way.

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,620
Well you called this one Kiki.
I appreciate your help.

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,980
‐Well of course you do.
‐[SHIRO] You better stay here.

43
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,720
What?!

44
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,600
[SHIRO] Michel and I can handle
it. You have a safe
journey home!

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,200
‐Well you heard what he said.
‐Shall we go?

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,120
Who said I was going anywhere?

47
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,260
[SHIRO] Michel get
inside the cockpit alright?

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,680
[MICHEL] Yes sir.

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,120
[SHIRO] Beam weapon. A high
energy beam weapon at that.
The monster.

50
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,240
They must've tested it here.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,260
[SHIRO] Alright! Michel you
ready? Move the leg a little
bit. But just a little OK?

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,210
Um right!

53
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,100
Michel!! Stop it!

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,440

55
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,340
Shit!

56
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,420
[KIKI] What're you doing?!

57
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,920
Are you trying to kill
Shiro or something?

58
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,640
Well I was... oh...

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,540
[MICHEL] Commander! Are you
alright?!

60
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,960
[SHIRO] I'm still alive. But
just barely.

61
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,760
Hey! Keep your mind on
what you're doing.

62
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,880
[MICHEL] I feel so far away BB.

63
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,560
Hey Michel! You can
start erasing my tracks now.

64
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,620
[MICHEL] Alright I'm
doing it now.

65
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,640
[KAREN] Michel while you're at
it wipe out my footprints too.

66
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,640
Roger! I'm on it!

67
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,100
[KAREN] Michel run a
point check on the balloons.

68
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Michel cut the wireless. Switch
everything over to
wired systems!

69
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,440
Yes Commander! Michel, Michel,
Michel... I'm only one person. I
can't do it all at once.

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,160
They treat me like I'm a kid.
Like I'm an idiot!

71
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,620
[MICHEL] Come on pull yourself
together Michel. You're
on a mission.

72
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,460
[KAREN] And don't make excuses
because Eledore isn't here.

73
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,200
That's not what I'm doing.
Just wait.

74
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,160
I haven't even finished
making preparations for
the trap construction yet.

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,560
‐[SHIRO] Michel!
‐Alright. OK OK OK!

76
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,180
Go back to the camp and
let them know where we are!

77
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,240
Well... but...

78
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,320
What? You want us to ride off
and leave you with the Feddies?

79
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,220
The Feds are only here because
of the information I provided.

80
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm gonna see this
through to the end.

81
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,020
The Commander must mean an awful
lot to you if you're willing to
risk your life to help 'em out.

82
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840

here you jerks! Ugh!

The drone is now proceeding
down the ravine.

85
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,500
It's heading into the testing
site and should arrive at point
delta on schedule.

particle broadcast. You
ready Michel?

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,200

point alpha now.

88

[SHIRO] Karen raise
the balloons!

89
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,950
[KAREN] Balloons raised.
Retreat path is closed!

90
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,240
Simulation is confirmed.

91
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,830

to pick it off.

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,250
I'm verifying simulation.
Passing point bravo sir.

94
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,040
[SHIRO] Now! Release the net
to the blind alley!

95
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,760
[KAREN] Net released.

96
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,720
[MICHEL] Confirmed!
Passing point charlie. Oh...

97
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,600
Alright! Now concentrate
all fire straight ahead

98
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,860
on the area right in
front of point delta!

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,760

gonna get you.

[KAREN] Michel would you wake
the hell up?! ‐I was!

103

as alert now that
Eledore isn't there!

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,090
But it wasn't... no...
it really was my fault. God!

What? Still here?

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,990

after I bring all this stuff
out here for you!

If a battle breaks out...
thanks... I'll have no way of
guaranteeing your safety.

109
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,940
Did you hear what I said?

110
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,260
Your shirt has a rip. You
know I can fix that.

Oh. Never mind.

are you being so shy about?

[SHIRO] Hey watch it!
Cut it out!

116
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,220

such a hard time? Come on
just take it off!

[SHIRO] Oh alright fine.
But just this once!

are they doing?

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,620
[MICHEL] Nothing. Nevermind.

an hour since the last
time I looked.

Can I come over for a little
visit? Your shirt's all fixed!

129
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,300
[SHIRO] What do I need a shirt
for in this heat?

130
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,640
[KIKI] You don't. But it'll
get cold tonight!

131
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,520
Michel is there any
word from the other units?

132
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,020
Nothing sir! Nothing yet.

133
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,980
[SHIRO] Then don't tie up
our comm system!

134
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,120
Oh brother. Just because he's in
command he gets all tough.
Stubborn fool.

135
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,960
Kiki. Tell me. You have a big
crush on the Commander
don't you?

136
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,960
Is this a letter from
your girlfriend?

137
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,580
What're you doing? Give it back!
Hey!

138
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,700
[KIKI] Dear Michel!
Thank you for all your letters.

139
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,740
[MICHEL] Stop that! Come
on give it back!

140
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,220
[KIKI] The letters you send to
me are the one &amp; only
comfort I have.

141
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,900
All I can do is wait for your
letters while I wait for you.

142
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,820
Boy this is really good!

143
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,313
But I'm always afraid because I
always end up wondering

144
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:07,040
if this is going to be your
last letter to me.

145
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,540
I feel as though the war is
pulling you further
away from me.

146
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,900
[KIKI] And I'm afraid that one
day the letters will
stop coming.

147
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,660
I don't think I'd be
able to take that.

148
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,100
Sometimes I wonder if it would
be easier for us to forget
about each other for a while.

149
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,340
I think I'm
done reading. Sorry.

150
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,020
