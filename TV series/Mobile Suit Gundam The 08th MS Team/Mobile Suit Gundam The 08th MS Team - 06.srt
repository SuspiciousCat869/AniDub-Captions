[AINA] No get away from me!

150
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,628
Shut up and listen! Do you wanna
die like those men?! Come on!

151
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,628
[AINA] Let go!!

152
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:01,138
[SHIRO] I'll let go when we get
inside! You can thank me later.

153
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:14,168
Here. You better let
me look at it.

154
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:21,878
Now you're really starting to
piss me off! You wanna
die or something?!

155
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:26,508
We have to conserve every
bit of air we have!

156
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:32,058
[SHIRO] Here. Hold still.

157
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:37,478
[SHIRO] What the hell did I
do to deserve this?

158
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:40,458
Why are you helping me?

159
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,258
Good question I wish I knew!

160
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:50,658
But I'm not letting you give up.
If we work together
we may survive.

161
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,958
Unless we run out of air.

162
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:57,078
How's your bandage?

163
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,368
No luck here either.

164
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:45,428
[SHIRO] We gotta hurry. The
longer we wait around the
more air we use up.

165
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:51,028
[SHIRO] I don't see the Fed
transport anywhere. Or any of
your Zeon mobile suits either.

166
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:54,458
[AINA] This wreckage
has drifted a long way off.

167
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,058
[SHIRO] Yeah.

168
00:15:56,058 --> 00:16:01,658
I know. There's bound to be
portable radio units or
signal flares

169
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:06,078
somewhere on board. Some way to
let people know that
we're alive.

170
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,108
[AINA] Right.

171
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:14,358
So we split up to look and
meet back here in 10 minutes?

172
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,428
[SHIRO] Sounds good. Uh...

173
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,368
Take this it's my
personal watch.

174
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:32,368
Whoa. Fancy watch
you have there.

175
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,138
Please be as gentle with
it as possible.

176
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:38,138
I'll keep it safe.
[AINA] Well come on!

177
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,428
[SHIRO] Oh. Right!

00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,888
[TECH] Alright! Release
the mooring lines!

179
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:44,658
[MAN] Whoever's finished get
back on the ship!

180
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:49,658
Let's move it. We have to hurry.
Even if that Ensign survived out
there his air supply

181
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:53,458
isn't going to hold out forever.
‐We're almost finished.

182
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,858
[MICHEL] No way he
could survive.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

186
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:13,258
[SHIRO] There's gotta be
something around
here we can use.

187
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,858
[AINA] Ugh no good!

188
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,258
That man...

189
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:33,708
Ugh. What a wreck!

190
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,568
[SHIRO] Hey...

191
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,708
That's it! These are perfect!

192
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,458
[AINA] Launch fireworks?

193
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,498
[SHIRO] Exactly. If they see an
explosion they'll
investigate the area right?

194
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,519
Just don't knock it
against anything.

195
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,006
[AINA] That's quite a
brainstorm you had!

196
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:11,046
[AINA] The detonator has a
3 second delay.

197
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,996
[SHIRO] Nice work.

198
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:15,996
We should be in the
fireworks business.

199
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,096
Huh? Right. Hahaha!

200
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:22,696
[SHIRO] Now move back.

00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:56,646
It does look like fireworks.

204
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:14,996
[SHIRO] You're
trembling you know.

205
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:20,196
If nobody is around to come
looking for us we'll die here.

206
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:24,796
Help is gonna come! I
know it will!

207
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,106
Soon I'll be down on
the surface.

208
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:33,106
What will you do there?

209
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:37,996
Well I suppose I'll be fighting.
But it's not really the
war that brings me

210
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:41,496
it's the chance to learn.
[AINA] Learn?

211
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:45,996
What I'm made of. What I'm
capable of achieving.

212
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:49,996
[SHIRO] No way i'm letting
myself die out here.
[AINA] You're not...

213
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:50,996
[SHIRO] What?

214
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:55,996
You're not exactly like what I
imagined a Federal
soldier would be.

215
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,396
I envy you.

216
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,396
Envy me?

217
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,536
[AINA] Oh!

218
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,876
Zeon mobile suits!

219
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,216
Come on let's go to them!

220
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:11,566
I don't wanna be a prisoner.

221
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:14,476
But if you stay here...
I can't just let you die!

222
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:16,476
Don't worry I'll be rescued.

223
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,796
But you...

224
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,736
You're wasting time now go!

00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,846
My name is Aina Sahalin!

Goodbye Shiro.

[PILOT] Glad to see you made it.
You OK?

229
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:47,746
Thank you. Yeah. I'm alright.
But I just wish we hadn't lost
all the battle data

230
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,296
from this test of the
improved mobile suit.

231
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:55,996
Aina! You forgot
your watch Aina!

232
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:01,106
Oh shit!

233
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,506
[PILOT] You see that?

234
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:08,996
Don't worry. That suit was
heavily damaged it couldn't put
up much of a fight anyway.

235
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:12,996
Let's get outta here OK?
[PILOT] Right.

236
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:23,996
[MICHEL] I can't believe it. He
came back alive after all that.

237
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:26,796
Now I have to rewrite my letter.

238
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:30,996
[SANDERS] Let him rest
for now kid. He's tired.

00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:34,306

received our orders just a
few minutes ago.

They say you and I have been
assigned to the same unit Chief.

243
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,996
It's a pleasure to meet you sir.

244
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:54,366
[SANDERS] Well looks like I'm
not getting shipped back
to my old unit.

245
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:57,966
Guess they got rid of the
jinx for good...

246
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:03,396

finally turn my
crummy luck around!

He's nuts!

00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:29,996
Yeah well. I heard they tell
that a big offensive is gonna
start any day now.

Who cares! We're gonna drive
those Zeon off our Earth
one way or another!

names of my new

00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:40,536
to go into action. I can't say
I'm not a little nervous but
it's important that I show my
