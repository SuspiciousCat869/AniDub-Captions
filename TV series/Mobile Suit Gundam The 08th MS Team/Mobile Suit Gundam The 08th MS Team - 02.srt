[MICHEL] Hey listen to him.

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,950
He even talks like

[KIKI] Michel! The

325
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,600
[MICHEL] They disappeared.

326
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
While we were sleeping?

327
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
[KIKI] But how?

328
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,550
[MICHEL] Well I've been
thinking about that.

329
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,900
Whether they were real
or if it was all

330
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,250
an illusion of some kind.

331
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,250
[KIKI] An illusion?

332
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,400
[MICHEL] Yeah an illusion. And
if it wasn't, maybe
they were ghosts.

333
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,300
[KIKI] I don't think they
were either one.

334
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,100
I believe they went off on a
search of their own somewhere.

335
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,500
[MICHEL] And what would they
be searching for?

336
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Same as everyone. A new world.
And maybe a better life.

337
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,950
[MICHEL] Yeah. I guess
you're right.
