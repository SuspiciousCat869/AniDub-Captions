those mobile suits

148
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,840
why the hell are we waiting for
them so far from the village?

149
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,600
Well I guess the Commander
knows what he's doing.

150
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,860
Maybe he wants the chance
to show how us clever he is?

151
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Karen! Sanders! Do you read me?
Come in!

152
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,100
[KAREN and SANDERS] Roger!

153
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,060
Alright when I give you the
signal I want you to start
picking off those mobile suits.

154
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,220
Roger that. So then you want
us to move into the village?

155
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,760
[SHIRO] Negative! I want you to
snipe 'em from you
current position.

156
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,620
What?! Wait a second. That
village is a good 10 clicks from
our current location!

157
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,260
Those things have thermonuclear
reactors. If our shots are
even 2 meters off...

158
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,055
I'm aware. But the last thing
that village can
afford right now

159
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,780
is a mobile suit battle smack
in the middle of it.

160
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,080
\Michel! Stop the truck!

161
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,900
[KAREN] Commander at least let
us move in a few more clicks.

162
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,440
[SHIRO] That's a negative. The
07th team spotted Zakus
in that area.

163
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,080
It is possible they
may be wrong.

164
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,360
Regardless the Zakus may have
made hostages of the village
already.

165
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,000
We don't have enough margin
for error. We need to be smart!

166
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,240
If one of those nuclear reactors
should go off everyone will die
friend and foe alike.

167
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,180
I know that.

168
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,400
[SHIRO] If worse comes to worse
I'll cripple one of them. You
take care of the other two.

169
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,680
[KAREN] But how can you do that?
All you have is
anti‐tank weaponry.

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,400
Only pilots understand how
pilots fight.

171
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,600
Thanks Michel. Get this comm
line secured and then get back
to the hover truck and stand by.

172
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:49,620
Commander! If this is about the
inquiry... it isn't worth
killing yourself over is it?

173
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,820
Just give the order you always
give! You know? About everyone
coming back in 1 piece!

174
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,100
[PILOT] Don't worry I won't
hurt you. Here this is for you.

175
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,060
Wow! It's made from one of
your shell casings.

176
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,080
You can keep it as a gift for
all the food you've given us.

177
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,900
Thanks a bunch mister! Haha!

178
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,850
What a momma's boy.

179
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,600
What's the point of trying to
make friends with some kid
that doesn't eve‐ huh?

180
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,200
Your food's ready.

181
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,560
She is a bit young but
beggars can't be choosers.

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,440
Ah!

183
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,840
[ZEON] Arth! Stop it!

184
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,880
[ARTH] Ha ha! You wouldn't shoot
one of your own men
now would ya?

185
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,340
I'll say you were
killed in action.

186
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,520
Alright. I'll put her down for
now. Oh but I will take
my food however.

187
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,320
[KIKI] Bastard!

188
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,550
No Kiki!

189
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,550
Wait!

190
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,840
We can't take the risk of
turning our village into a war
zone for revenge.

191
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,420
We'll wait for our chance.

192
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,300
Well it serves her right.

193
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,560
You're dead!

194
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,700
[EXPLOSION]

195
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,360
Hey something's going on!

196
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,060
Damn!

197
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,080
[KAREN] This is maximum
magnification? This is shit!

198
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,780
That idiot! It was too soon for
that! Now we can't let the
other 2 get outta here!

199
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,250
This is the guerrilla hideout!

200
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh yeah this was a quiet little
village to stop
through for food.

201
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,300
[ZEON] Dell! No point in staying
here now let's get the
hell out of here!

202
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
[DELL] Roger! What about Arth?

203
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,960
[ZEON] Forget Arth. I'll cover
you. Can you jump?

204
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,820
[DELL] Yeah. I should be
able to manage 1.

205
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,560
You're not getting away!

206
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,500
Great there's another one.

207
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,520
Damn! Seems like they don't
want us to get away!

208
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
Do you think you can walk?

209
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,040
You're alive! Shiro you
came back. But... where am I?

210
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,660
We're in danger. Come on now.
Move! Ah!

211
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,240
Oh Shiro... you came to save me.

212
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,420
I'm here... I'm here for
everyone in the village
Kiki not just you.

213
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,720
Hmph. Well fine. Ah!

214
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:18,660
A cyclops. What happened?
The house! Daddy?! Daddy!

215
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,920
[ZEON] What's wrong with them?
Don't they know if they keep us
from escaping it'll

216
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,860
just turn their village
into a battlefield?

217
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,000
[REBEL] You're not getting
outta here alive!

218
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,500
Get the women and children out of
the village. Anyone who can
fight drive the enemy

219
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,440
toward the river!

220
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,620
Are you trying to let them get
away?

221
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,940
I'm trying to save your
village.

222
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,920
But the village wants them
to pay for what they've done!

223
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,440
Right now those pilots are
desperate to stay alive as well.

224
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,820
You're new to this we don't
care what you think!

225
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,740
This fight doesn't end until
they're all dead.

226
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,060
[SHIRO] Kiki is this
how you feel too?

227
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,220
It is. I want to get them
back for my dad.

[YELLING IN AGREEMENT]

229
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,260
[SHIRO] So much for youthful
idealism. The funny thing is I
wanted to save those

230
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,060
fools in the Zakus too.

231
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,900
What the devil was
that fool babbling about?

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,340

Stand by with the beam rifles!

They're using beam weaponry!

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,820
There's no point in fighting any
further! Surrender!
We'll let you live.

243
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,700
They got Dell too. I won't
surrender to you!

Don't do it! No!

you can still fire at the enemy?

[SOBBING]

258
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,140
I wasn't able to help them after
all. I couldn't save any
of the villagers.

259
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,200
And I couldn't even find
the truth in my own words.

260
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,540
That's not true Shiro! Everyone
in this village would've
been wiped out if you

261
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,900
hadn't shown up when you did!

[SHIRO] Eledore has recovered and
rejoined the 08th team. Just
as we receive orders

267
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,660
to attack an enemy base in an
airdrop operation. Karen is
nervous about making

268
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,040
her first drop. And Sanders says
there's something strange
going on. As for me I

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,900
still feel torn but
thinking like that is just going
to get my team killed.
