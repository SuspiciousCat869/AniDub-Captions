You can break it up with a
hammer and use it for cooking!

oil I found in Libya.

By the way, Makoto...

00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,728
Have I heard correctly...

335
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,195
you haven't used magic
since leaving home?

336
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:12,762
Ah! Wh‐where did
you hear that...?

337
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,995
From our little friend here.
(Mrow)

338
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:18,428
(Prolonged groan)
She said all you've done
is fly on your broom.

339
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:20,462
And that was just once.

340
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,528
Is that true?

00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:22,695

Is that true?

Uh... Yes...

345
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,328
It's just as you say...

346
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,962
I'm sorry...

347
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:37,462
Oh, that's okay.
It's not something you
have to apologize for.

348
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:41,428
Unlike me, you're not the
type of witch who has to
rely solely on her magic.

349
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:44,295
You should be able to learn and
cast spells on your own pace.

350
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,462
Anyway, that's my opinion
as your big sister.

351
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:48,562
(Sigh)

352
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,428
That being said,
magic gets rusty

353
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,195
if you don't
use it that often.

354
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:55,628
Even just keeping
up with a few basic
practices is enough.

Got it?
Understood!

Good! Well, how about I teach
you an easy spell right now?

00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,495
We'll warm up with
something you can ease into.

We need your help.

Is there a place around

Um... A place you
two won't be seen...?

You won't be seen
in most places.

There aren't many
people here.

366
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:23,762
[AKANE]
In the olden days, this spell
was often used by witches.

367
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,362
It's super simple,

368
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,795
so it's an ideal practice
for beginner witches to try.

369
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:30,328
Chinatsu, are you
going to watch?

370
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,195
Yeah, I want to
see some magic!

371
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:35,028
(Crackling)
[AKANE]
I'll go first to show
you how it's done.

372
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:39,628
Chinatsu, can I please
have one or two strands
of your hair?

373
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,995
You want my hair?

374
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,028
Huh...

375
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,095
Will this be enough?

376
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:48,228
Yep, thank you.

377
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,828
Now, we put your
hair inside...

378
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,128
and write the spell here.

379
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:58,028
[AKANE]
This magic requires hair
from a girl with black hair.

380
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:02,195
So, my hair wouldn't work
since it's not black.

381
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,262
Next, you throw
it into the fire.

382
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,628
(Crackling)

383
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:09,895
And let it burn until
it turns in to ash.

384
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,728
Then...

385
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,228
...use water to put
out the fire out!

386
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,628

00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,828
Is it done?
What's it do?

389
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,995
They're on their way now,
so don't you worry at all.

390
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:30,662
Chinatsu, try holding
up your arm like this.

391
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,862
My arm?

00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,762
(CAW!)
(Both gasp)

393
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,162
Ahh! Whoa! It's a crow!
(Cawing)

394
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:41,395
Yep. This spell will summon
crows to wherever you are.

395
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,995
The smoke acts as a marker
to draw the crows to you.

396
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,695
I heard long ago that witches
hired to fight in wars

397
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:50,828
often used crows to carry out
reconnaissance on the enemy.

398
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:53,462
Wow! Who'd have thought?

399
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:54,862
So cool!

400
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:58,662
Okay, Little Sister,
now you give it a try.

401
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,362
Right, I'll give it a go!

402
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:09,897
[MAKOTO]
For the hair, is it
okay to use my own?

403
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,097
Sure, any black hair
will do fine.

404
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,497
(Crackling)

405
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:18,197
Now you just need to put out
the fire with water.

406
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,363
It really is
quite simple.

It is because you used
a witch's hair!

It's way too powerful.
