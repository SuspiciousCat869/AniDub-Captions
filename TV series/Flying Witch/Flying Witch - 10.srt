the teaspoon, please.

What the..?! You're putting
honey in the curry?!

But I do need to cook it
longer or the curry won't
be thick enough.

00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:44,870
(slight laugh)
I know, right?

157
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,537
[MAKOTO]
I'm gonna go ahead
and wash these.

158
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,604
[NAO]
Huh? Makoto, are you already
finish baking the cookies?

159
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,937
No, I'm just wanting the
dough to rest a bit longer.

160
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:55,670
Then, after that all I
need to do is cut out
the shapes and bake 'em.

161
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,604
Wow, you work fast.

162
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,937
I bet they're made from
magic, and that they're
insanely delicious

163
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,437
Good point.

164
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,470
Wait guys...

165
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,504
please don't set such
high expectations.

166
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:06,904
Hey Makoto.

167
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,804
Do witches have a kind
of traditional cookie‐

168
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:10,170
that they always bake?

169
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,437
Hmm...

170
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,437
I wouldn't say it's
traditional per se,

171
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,737
but we witches do have a
pretty interesting cookie.

172
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,070
[NAO]
What's it like?

173
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,704
[MAKOTO]
It's a called a
"Witch's Pinkie."

174
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,170
[NAO]
"Witch's Pinkie?"

175
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,670
Very true to its namesake,

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,904
it's supposed to look just
like a witch's pinkie finger.

177
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:27,937
Among us fellow witches...it's
a good luck charm for romantic
relations.

178
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,070
Oh, for real?
That's pretty cute.

179
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,904
Since I'm making cookies...
let's add them in too!

180
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,937
I've got all the
ingredients I need already.

181
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,637
[NAO]
Oh, sounds good.
I want to try one.

182
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,104
[KEI]
Nao, those are burning.

183
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,204
Uh! Oh shoot! Ugh!

184
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:49,504
(STUDENTS chattering)

185
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,437
(concentrating)

186
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:54,504
(sniffing)

187
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:55,804
(content sigh)

188
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:57,570
That should do it.

189
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,804
[NAO]
It's done! Ahh...

190
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:08,770
Oh?

191
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,037
You did an
excellent job.

192
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,437
One more left.

193
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,570
[MAKOTO]
That looks great!

194
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,637
[KEI]
Tasty.

195
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,070
I can't believe I made these.

196
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,304
They turned out great for
your first time. Wow!

197
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,737
You know...you've really
have a talent for cooking.

198
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,670
(laugh) Really?
Thank you.

199
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,137
(stomach growling)
[MAKOTO] Huh?

200
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,537
[NAO]
That was me. Ugh...

201
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:29,837
I'm like super hungry now that
I'm not so nervous anymore.

202
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,604
Wah! Ah! What's that you're
holding, Makoto?!

203
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,004
[MAKOTO] Hmh?
[NAO] THAT!

204
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,670
[NAO]
A finger?!

205
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,804
Oh, you mean this?

206
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,304
[NAO]
Wah! Gross!

207
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,170
[NAO]
What's with that thing?!

208
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,504
My cookie? It's a Witch's
Pinkie I was talking about
earlier.

209
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,237
[NAO]
Huh? That's a cookie?!

210
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,704
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, that's all it is.

211
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,504
The nail's made from an almond.

212
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:52,337
And the trick is trying to make
them look as real as possible.

213
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:53,937
[MAKOTO]
Like this.

214
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,237
Ugh, that's
too realistic.

215
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:59,637
It will look more
real once I bake it.

216
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,204
[NAO]
This helps with relationships?

217
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,604
I envisioned something adorable.

218
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,037
[STUDENT] Hm? Uh!
[MAKOTO] (smile)

219
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:10,204
Hey! Once your group finishes,
feel free to eat, okay?

220
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,737
[KEI]
Curry's ready.

221
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,337
[KEI]
Let's show the teacher.

222
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:20,004
Way to go. Can we just eat
already? I'm dying over here.

223
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,604
It all looks good.

224
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:26,370
[NAO]
All I want to do is have a big
huge helping of delicious rice.

225
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,104
[MAKOTO]
Nothing wrong with that.
You worked up an appetite.

226
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:33,104
[NAO]
You're right. I've earned
myself a reward today.

227
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,137
[NAO]
Uh... Who was in charge
of cooking the rice?

228
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,904
[KEI]
We never did decide...

229
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,387
(AKANE sleeping)

230
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,854
[MAKOTO]
Kei, what should I take with me?

231
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:59,887
[KEI] Let me think... At least
take some work gloves.
(AKANE snoring)

232
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,821
(waking up)

233
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,587
(stretching, groan)

234
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,054
[MAKOTO]
Will these clothes be okay or
should I wear something else?

235
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,987
[KEI] They're fine if you're
okay with them getting dirty.
(AKANE sleepy shuffle)

236
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,554
[MAKOTO]
Ah, Akane.

237
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,654
[AKANE]
Huh? Where are you going
so early in the morning?

238
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:18,121
[CHINATSU]
We're going to go thin
out the apple trees.

239
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,954
Thin out? (big yawn)
What's that?

240
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:25,354
[MAKOTO]
It's the job of picking
the apple blossoms.

241
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,254
I think you slightly
misunderstood.

242
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,321
[MAKOTO]
Huh? That's not right?

243
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,254
[KEI]
Well, you'll see
when we get there.

244
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,221
Akane, you should
come and join us.

245
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:36,787
Hmm, let's see... I don't
have any other plans.

246
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:40,121
Yippee! I get to hang
out with Akane!

247
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,821
Kids! Time to get a move on.

248
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:45,087
[MAKOTO AKANE CHINATSU] Okay!
[KEI] Alright.

249
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:52,354
[AKANE]
Hmm...What a nice breeze.

250
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,021
[MAKOTO]
(inhale) It smells
so nice out here.

251
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,454
[MAKOTO]
Hey, how far along
are the blossoms?

252
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:00,821
They're in half‐bloom.

253
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:02,754
You know you are pretty
amazing, Chinatsu.

254
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:04,254
You sure know a lot.

255
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:07,521
[CHINATSU]
(giggling) Makoto,
you're even more amazing.

256
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,521
You can fly all around!

257
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,854
Yahooo!

258
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,154
That's dangerous!

259
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,121
I'm fine, really!

260
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,154
They're here.

261
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,521
(AKANE getting up &amp; stretching)

262
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,154
Mmph!

263
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,354
(car door opening and closing)

264
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,054
[LADY A]
Good morning.

265
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,121
[NANA]
Good morning.

266
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,787
Good morning to
you, Ma'am.

267
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,087
[LADY A]
Good morning.

268
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:54,121
[LADY B]
Good morning.

269
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,587
And who's this
young lady?

270
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,554
She's a relative of mine.
She's here to help us out.

271
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,221
[MAKOTO]
I look forward to
working alongside you.

272
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,754
[LADY A]
My...what sweet manners
you have there girl.

273
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:06,554
[CHINATSU] She says
you're sweet.
[MAKOTO] You're too kind.

274
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,587
[LADY A] Oh my, there's
also a foreigner here.
[CHINATSU] Oh?!

275
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:13,954
(laughing) Despite my exotic
looks, I'm actually Japanese.

276
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,921
(bees buzzing)

277
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,021
[LADY C]
Cats?

278
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,854
[KEIJI]
Sooo...

279
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:24,587
I betcha we can finish up the
thinning out there before the
day's over.

280
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,087
Let's get'er done, okay?

281
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:28,921
Well then, I'll see
ya'll in them fields.

282
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,321
[ALL]
Okay.

283
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,021
This is for you two.

284
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:45,587
[MAKOTO]
Wow...it's so beautiful
here, isn't it?

285
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,154
It is... really something.

286
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,587
[AKANE]
I always imagined apple
trees being taller.

287
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:54,554
[KEI]
We prune the branches, to
make sure they will all grow
out to the side.

288
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:59,221
[AKANE]
Ah, I see now! So if
they're left alone they
end up growing taller?

289
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:03,187
[KEI]
Right. And it's a lot easier to
tend them when their branches
are closer to the ground.

290
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:07,687
When you're walking around the
farm grounds, be sure to watch
where you're going or you might
bump your head.

291
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,354
[AKANE] Got it.
(THUMP) [MAKOTO] Ow!
(whimpering sounds)

292
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,921
[CHINATSU] Ouch.
[AKANE KEI] Huh?

293
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,387
[AKANE]
(slight laugh) What happened?

294
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,987
Don't tell me you
bumped your head.

295
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,387
I was looking at the blossoms...
(AKANE laughing)

296
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,421
Come on, Kei was just telling
us to watch were we're going.

297
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,821
I swear you can be such
a klutz at times.

298
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,087
(MAKOTO whimpering)

299
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:26,654
You've gotta watch
where you're going. Ah!

300
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,287
(AKANE fighting off the pain)

301
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:34,521
[KEI]
Hey dad?

302
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,587
Hmm?

303
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,087
[KEI]
Where should we start?

304
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,487
Well, why don't you guys
start with that there tree.
