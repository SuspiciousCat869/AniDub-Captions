00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,861
[WOMAN]
Are you like Little Red
Riding Hood or something?!

162
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:43,995
Stop it.

163
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,297
[MAKOTO]
Here. Is this alright?

164
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,567
Yes. Let's see...

165
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,835
Makoto Kowata.

166
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:53,371
So I believe you wanted
to know about your future.

167
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,508
Well then, let me tell
your for...TUNE!

168
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:57,676
[ALL]
"Tune"?

169
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,043
(Hysterical laughter)

170
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,345
I see now..
So, that's how it is...

171
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:04,248
Why, of course it
would be... Finally!

172
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:07,018
Finally, the time has come...!

173
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:09,654
(Maniacal laugh)

174
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,956
Uh... Is it something
in my future?

175
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,959
Um Uh... to more accurately
tell your fortune,

176
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,461
there is one more thing I'd
like you to write for me.

177
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,097
O‐okay...

178
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,800
For the time being,
I need you to write down
your phone number,

179
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,935
postal code, address,
family structure,
blood relatives,

180
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,404
and anything else about
yourself you can think of!

181
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,542
(Heavy breathing)
Uh... I think that's maybe
asking a bit too much.

182
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,276
This is some crazy stuff.

183
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,311
Is this legit?

184
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,614
Oh! Ah, yeah, you're right.

185
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,315
I guess you don't REALLY

186
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,018
want to give out all your
personal info to a stranger...

187
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,521
But please, tell
me just one thing.

188
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,457
Are you Akane Kowata's
younger sister?

189
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,060
Whoa, amazing.
She's right!

190
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,797
Incredible! You are right...
My sister's name IS Akane.

191
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:56,267
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! YES!

192
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,502
AWESOME!

193
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,671
So, uh...
what about my fortune?

194
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,472
I couldn't care
less about that!

195
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,707
What?!

196
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,309
I was never telling
your fortune anyway!

197
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,377
Why?

198
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:07,979
You're a witch,
aren't you?

199
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,814
[KEI] Whoa...
Uh! Uh... why do you...?

200
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,249
That's crazy! I'm not a...

201
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,718
You don't have to hide
it. I'm a witch, too.

202
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,920
Huh?! You are?!

203
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,757
Yes. I came up to this
area five years ago.

204
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:21,660
Oh, that makes you
Makoto's senior.

205
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,963
Ah! This is great!

206
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,699
I never thought I would ever
meet a fellow witch here.

207
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,400
I sure hope we
can get along!

208
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,002
HMPH!

209
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,939
Don't act all
friendly with me!

210
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,708
Uh...

211
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,810
Makoto Kowata...

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,646
let me tell you what
happened a year ago.

213
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,715
Last year? Tell me.

214
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,719
It happened at last year's
Cherry Blossom Festival...

215
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,756
(Hysterical laughter)

216
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,926
Inukai, you're doing fortune
telling now? That's cool!

217
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,828
Well, it's just on
the street.

218
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,030
But, yeah, I do
it now and again.

219
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,000
I've actually become
quite popular with a
lot of my predictions.

220
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,468
You should come around sometime
so I can read your fortune.

221
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,204
(Gulping)
Ahh!

222
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,539
Oh, really?

223
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,140
Are you sure you're
TELLING fortunes

224
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,009
and not just trying
to MAKE a fortune?

225
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,944
(Laughs)
What are you talking about?

226
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:16,648
Anyway, what's the occasion
for you coming up here and
visiting this old town?

227
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,249
Hmm... Well, you see,

228
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,885
my lovely little sister is on
the road to becoming a witch,

229
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,286
and might move up here,

230
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:24,488
so I wanted to check
the place out first.

231
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,390
[INUKAI]
Your younger sister, huh?

232
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,728
If you happen to ever cross
paths, be nice to her, okay?

233
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,095
Of course I will!

234
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,831
Alright! Huh?
Just leave it to me, Akane!

235
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,266
Aha! Great!
Cheers to that!

236
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,200
(Inukai laughs)

237
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,069
You sure you haven't
had too much?

238
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,204
Oh, I know! As a way
of saying thanks,

239
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,007
I'll show you some magic
I've been working on recently.

240
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,209
It's pretty awesome.
I promise!

241
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,678
You sure about that?

242
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,781
(Hysterical laugh)
Yep. And cheers to that!

243
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,816
(Tink)
(Laughs)

244
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,655
Basically, you had a good
time drinking, right?

245
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,023
Wrong!

246
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,961
One of Akane's momentary
whims resulted in me
transforming into this

247
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,531
maddening and hideous form
taunting me forever!

248
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:08,299
(Amazed gasp)

249
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,670
How am I supposed to live
with this body of mine?!

250
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:18,743
(Heavy breathing)

251
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,211
She's so cute!

252
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,179
AH!

253
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
[MAKOTO]
Uhh...

254
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:30,776
[INUKAI]
Chocolate?

255
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,145
You'd think so, right?

256
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,247
But they're actually
infused with magic.

257
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,282
Someone I know wanted
me to make some,

258
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:38,317
so I thought I'd make
a trial batch.

259
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,519
Oh? So what kind of
effect do they have?

260
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,255
They can turn people
into animals.

261
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:46,292
Huh?! That's pretty advanced
magic you're working with!

262
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,961
That's what I've been told.

263
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:49,996
But I wanted to give
it a shot anyway.

264
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,497
(Laughs)

265
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,566
You really are a mad genius!

266
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,103
A witch your age who can do
that kind of magic is
practically unheard of!

267
00:11:57,203 --> 00:11:59,605
Hehe! That's simply not true.

268
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:03,576
Anyway, they've never
been tested so I don't
know if they work.

269
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:06,279
Why don't you try
one out for me?

270
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,514
No way! Are you crazy?!

271
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:10,283
I don't wanna be
your guinea pig!

272
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:12,785
(Birds chirping)

273
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:17,756
(Light snoring)

274
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,699
(Groans)

275
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,269
What happened? What the...?

276
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,072
I can't remember anything
from last night. Ugh.

277
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,042
Except that my head
is really killing me.

278
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,777
Alcohol is bad news,
that's for sure.

279
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,346
Hm?

280
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,749
(Confused groan)

281
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:58,031
WHAT?! WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I?!

282
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,601
Hey, Akane!
Akane! AKANE!

283
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,803
That's what happened
last year.

284
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:08,207
So my sister's magic has
made you turn into that?

285
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,009
Well, we were both pretty
drunk at the time,

286
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:13,312
so she probably just got carried
away and fed it to me.

287
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,548
Fortunately, the
magic was imperfect,

288
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,284
so I return to my human form
when the sun goes down.

289
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,154
But it's really been a huge
hindrance to my private life.

290
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,388
Ooh...
Stop doing that.

291
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,991
How exactly do you
know my sister?

292
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,792
We're just very
old friends.

293
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,628
But since
she's been wandering around
the world for such a long time,

294
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:32,431
I can never seem to pin
down her whereabouts.

295
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,300
I thought that maybe
she'd come back here,

296
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,603
so I've been fortune telling
on the side of the street.

297
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:40,673
And then you just showed up
today right out of the blue.

298
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,108
Hm...

299
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,577
I'm sorry about yelling
at you earlier.

300
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:47,146
I was just so surprised
that I just kind of lost it.

301
00:13:47,246 --> 00:13:50,183
Oh, that's okay.
Please don't worry about it.

302
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,817
Ah... I'm glad we met.

303
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,087
Now the magic can
finally be undone!

304
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:57,790
You're her little sister, so
you probably know how to get
in touch with her, right?

305
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:00,994
Would you mind giving
her my cell number,
so I can call her?

306
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,229
I don't think she carries
a cell phone with her.

307
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,766
Uh?
And no one in our family
ever knows her whereabouts.

308
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,402
Oh...

309
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,274
[CHINATSU]
I'm home!

310
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,576
Hm? Hmm.

311
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,578
Hi, Momma!

312
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,048
Well, you're back
earlier than I expected.

313
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:23,782
[CHINATSU]
This is my mom.

314
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,485
Oh my, what a cute guest you
have brought here.

315
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,720
Is this a friend of yours?

316
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,655
[CHINATSU]
Yeah! Her name's Inukai!

317
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:30,556
(Squeak)

318
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,491
I'm Chinatsu's mother.

319
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,961
Thank you for looking
after my kid.

320
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,229
(Sad squeak)
Y‐your welcome...

321
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,796
[NANA]
Looks like teatime!

322
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:40,633
Makoto said for you
to wait here.

323
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,002
Your mother didn't
seem surprised at all.

324
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:46,039
I hear when people get old,
they aren't easily surprised.

325
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,707
Where... is...?

326
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,409
Ah, here it is.

327
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,545
Thank you for
the tea, Ma'am.

328
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,048
[MAKOTO]
Hey, I found it!
Oh?

329
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:57,683
[MAKOTO]
We should be able to fix
your problem using this.

330
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,218
Hm...

331
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:02,355
The complete book of magic for
changing animals into people...

332
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:04,190
[INUKAI]
You using this on me?

333
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,093
Yes, I plan to reverse
my sister's magic.

334
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,461
You don't have to do that.

335
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,663
Just let Akane
know to contact me...

336
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:12,431
This is my sister we're
talking about,

337
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,567
so who knows when she'll
be back!

338
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:17,336
I consider my sister's
blunder to also be my own,

339
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,506
(Intrigued squeak)
so please let me take
responsibility for it.

340
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,108
[INUKAI]
Uh...

341
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,044
But this magic looks pretty
difficult to master correctly...

342
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:26,479
(Chinatsu gasps)
It'll be fine!

343
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,147
It's not like I'm lightheartedly
jumping into this.

344
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:31,250
Or that I'm using
this as another excuse
to practice magic.

345
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,522
I'm going into this with
a serious mindset that's
ready, willing, and able.

346
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:43,096
(Crackling)

347
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,169
(Worried moan)

348
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:54,107
Wow, how witchy.

349
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,474
Yeah, it's really witchy.

350
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:58,644
Um... that's
because I AM.

351
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:00,479
[MAKOTO]
Okay...

352
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:03,482
Lastly, it needs
a drop of this.

353
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,920
(Bubbling)

354
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,687
(Light poof)

355
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:10,756
Whoa!

356
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:14,961
(Chi?)

357
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,864
(Meow)

358
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:20,266
It should be
ready now.

359
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,501
[CHINATSU]
They look like konpeito!

360
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,437
[INUKAI]
Will this cure me?

361
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:26,772
No, it's not supposed
to cure you completely.

362
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:30,276
But this medicine
should temporarily change
you back into a person

363
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,311
for the rest of
the day at least.

364
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:36,449
It would allow you to
remain in your human form
even when the sun is out.

365
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:39,518
I guess it's better
than having no options.

366
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,254
Do you think this
stuff will be safe?

367
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,422
I believe so! I'm sure
it'll work fine!

368
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,591
(Worried moan)

369
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,426
(Excited giggle)

370
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,128
(Meow)
(Squeak)

371
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:50,829
(Apprehensive sighs)

372
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,831
(Excited sigh)

373
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,033
Om!

374
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:00,539
(Light groan)

375
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,009
I think you made it worse.

376
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,278
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

377
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,914
(Stifled laughter)
[INUKAI] What am I
supposed to do with this?

378
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:09,448
[MAKOTO]
You just had the one candy,

379
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,284
so you'll most likely
turn back soon!

380
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:12,952
(Sigh)

381
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,955
Thank goodness!
I'm back to normal.

382
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:18,424
Well, not really
normal, per se...

383
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,759
I'm so very sorry
about that.

384
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,462
Really, it's fine.
You didn't mean to do it.

385
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:27,000
But I guess it will
be quite a while before
I can be cured of this.

386
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,635
I'll contact you as soon as
my sister comes back here,

387
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,570
so please try to
wait until then.

388
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,373
I wonder when
she'll show up again.

389
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,409
Well, she dropped by
here not too long ago,

390
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:39,812
so I can't say for sure
when we will see her
back down here again.

391
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:40,479
Huh?

392
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,915
[INUKAI]
I see...

393
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:44,117
Guess all I can do is
wait patiently.

394
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:45,384
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:46,886
It's not like you
did anything wrong,

396
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:49,923
so don't worry
about it.
'Kay...

397
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:53,659
(Laughs)
You two sure don't look
anything alike for sisters.

398
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,828
Yeah, I know.
People often say that.

399
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,098
Oh? I personally think
we look a lot like sisters.

400
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,299
(Both gasp)

401
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,768
Especially since
we're both beautiful.

402
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,348
Okay!
(Terrified squeak)

403
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:13,051
Sorry for pulling out
the lame joke for you.

404
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,719
You... finally...

405
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,055
Long time no see,
my friend!

406
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:19,958
Oh! What in the world are you
even doing here anyway, Inukai?

407
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,361
Did you forget?!
Last year, you told me to
come get my fortune read!

408
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,164
UHH!
I went all the way to
the festival grounds

409
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,166
and couldn't
find you anywhere.

410
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,533
I was forced to enjoy
it all by myself!

411
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,170
Uh!
Anyway, you want some
of this takoyaki?

412
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,806
Did you really have to get so
angry right after seeing me?!

413
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,942
You're the one who made me
look like one of your sick
little jokes!

414
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:41,012
You have any idea how much I've
suffered through all of this?!

415
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,480
Huh?! Do you?!

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,348
Huh? What are
you talking about?

417
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:47,485
You did that all to
yourself, you know?

418
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:49,520
What?

419
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,655
(Drunk laughter)

420
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,258
Come on, Inukai,
you've had too much.

421
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,928
Meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow.

422
00:18:57,028 --> 00:19:01,833
Drinking with you is so much
fun that I always lose track
and go way overboard.

423
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,401
Oh, my bad!

424
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:08,707
(Gnawing)
Hm? What are you
chewing on there?

425
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:10,074
A skewer.

426
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,143
(Continued chewing)

427
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:14,879
Akane, I want some
more snacks!

428
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,882
More snacks? So sorry,
but I'm all outta money.

429
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,252
Then let's make some
using magic, with
leaves or something!

430
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,288
(Laughing)
Because we'd get arrested.

431
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,825
(Groan)

432
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:28,793
[INUKAI]
Wait, you had that
chocolate, right?

433
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:30,962
Yeah, but I won't
let you eat that.

434
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:35,199
Come on! Earlier,
you were trying to get me
to test it out for you.

435
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,201
Ow, ow... Cut it out, Inukai!

436
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,138
That was just a silly joke
I was playing on you.

437
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,572
(Hungry groans)

438
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:42,807
Here it is!
Uhh!

439
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,508
I'm not playing around!
(Giggling)

440
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,344
You're really turning
into some sort of animal!

441
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:47,578
It's fine.

442
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,580
The first kanji in my name
means "dog,"

443
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,116
so I've been thinking maybe
I should be more like a dog!

444
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,952
[AKANE] (Laughs)
That's some
crazy person talk.

445
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:55,186
Looks yummy!

446
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:59,023
Ah, no, no, no! Don't!
Time for a little snack!

447
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:01,592
(Groan)

448
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:03,361
You remember now?

449
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:04,963
Yeah...

450
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:07,766
Then when morning came and
you saw your new appearance...

451
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:11,002
I have a feeling I was actually
really happy with it, wasn't I?

452
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:14,673
[AKANE]
Yup. And then you
went back to sleep and I
couldn't get you to wake up

453
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,607
no matter how hard I tried.

454
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,710
You think... I'll get cured?

455
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,411
Not anytime soon.

456
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,780
But the effect will
eventually wear off,

457
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,915
so try not to lose it
in the meantime.

458
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:24,949
Okay...

459
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,051
(Bugs chirping)

460
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:29,587
I'm so sorry for causing
so much trouble!

461
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,157
[AKANE]
I've also been searching
for a way to reverse
the magic, Inukai.

462
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:35,026
I'll let you know
what I find.

463
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,394
Great, thanks.

464
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,863
Huh? Inukai,
your face changed.

465
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:42,801
Oh, yeah, it's already
nighttime, isn't it?

466
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,403
Well, this is my true
appearance looks like.
(Squeak)

467
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,238
Remember that, okay?

468
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:48,639
(Light chuckles)

469
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,709
Well then, I guess
I better be going.
