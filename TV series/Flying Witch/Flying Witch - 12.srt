Huh?

312
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,646
[MAKOTO]
Ah, there it is.

313
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,010
Hmh?

314
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,677
What's wrong?

315
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:57,710
Umm...

316
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,977
It's uh...

317
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,777
Well it's twitching
around weirdly.

318
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,010
Hmm?

319
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:05,477
[MAKOTO] Wha..?
[AKANE] Uh...?

320
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,344
Could this really
be one them?

321
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,544
[AKANE]
Hup! I gotcha now! Come here!

322
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,944
[MAKOTO] Whahhh!

323
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,344
(laughing) I thought
we'd find one.

324
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:20,977
[KENNY]
Mraw...

325
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:23,210
Yeah...it's
a groundfish!

326
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,677
Groundfish?

327
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:28,044
[AKANE]
Yep. You know, fish
that live in the ground.

328
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:34,044
[AKANE]
These fish love festivals.
They come around whenever
one draws near.

329
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,710
So they like festivals?
That's weird.

330
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,877
Yep.

331
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,677
Eh... (bewildered)

332
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,810
(yelp)

333
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:50,677
Ahaha! Better watch out
there. Groundfish love
playing tricks on us.

334
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,110
(sigh)

335
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,644
Oh. Oh. Oh!

336
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,444
Why are there so
many of them here?

337
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:05,644
Well I had a feeling
something had to be
lurking in the background.

338
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,077
I should have
figured it was you.

339
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,410
[AKANE]
You here to see Neputa?

340
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:16,277
[AKANE]
I see. Well, it certainly
is a fun festival.

341
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,544
(uncorking, giggling)

342
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,444
What are you
doing, Akane?

343
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,177
Ah... just sharing
what I have.

344
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,644
Huh?

345
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,710
(laughing) You guys are some
heavy drinkers, aren't you?

346
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,444
Here, have some snacks
while you're at it.

347
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:45,744
That is amazing! Do you mind
if I try and feed them, too?

348
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:46,877
Sure.

349
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,410
Here.

350
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:49,577
Thank you.

351
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:50,510
Hmm!

352
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,710
[MAKOTO] Hup!
[AKANE] Huh?

353
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:56,577
(freaking out)

354
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:58,244

(chasing meows)

356
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,910
[MAKOTO]
Akane, I feel like you've been
staying here for a while now.

357
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,810
I suppose you're right.
It's just so comfortable
being around here.

358
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,377
It is nice, isn't it?

359
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,644
Also... the sake
here is great, too!

360
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,977
Jeez, Akane...

361
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,210
[CHINATSU] Makoto.
[AKANE] Huh?

362
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,377
Hey there, Chinatsu.
Why are you up?

363
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:26,344
I had to use the bathroom.
(sleepy sigh)

364
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:35,644
(sleeping breathes)

365
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,610
[AKANE]
Did you make that robe for her?

366
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,544
[MAKOTO] Yeah.

367
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,510
[AKANE]
I bet she was very happy.

368
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,244
[AKANE] She is sleeping
in it, afterall.

369
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:50,110
She was super excited
about it, which made me
really happy.

370
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,177
I think you'll
probably be fine.

371
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,410
Huh?

372
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,977
Isn't it coming up?

373
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:58,010
Your first status
report to the Society,
since moving here.

374
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,444
Oh...

375
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:05,510
Yeah. I think I have a lot I can
talk about with the Society.

376
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,077
That's good to
hear, Makoto.

377
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,977
(happy) Oh?

378
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,577
Hey, cut it out. You'll wake
up Chinatsu by doing that.

379
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,644
(inflating)
[MAKOTO] Oh, I'm sorry. Oh?

Now I have one more
thing I can talk about.
