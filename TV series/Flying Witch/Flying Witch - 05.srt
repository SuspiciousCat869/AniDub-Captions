332
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,059
What kind of person was she?

333
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,326
She was a regular girl
just like you are now, dear.

334
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,159
She was fond
of magic charms

335
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,393
and taught me quite a few
of them back in our heyday.

336
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:07,793
Magic charms...?

337
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:08,926
Uh?

338
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,693
Let me tell you a secret...

339
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,893
It was thanks to one
of her magic charms

340
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:18,026
that I was able to
finally marry my husband.

341
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:22,193
So cool! A charm for falling
in love?! What is it?

342
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,826
Good question...

343
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,026
Well, I tried so many
that I have no idea

344
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,793
which one was the
winning magic charm.
(Chuckles)

345
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,393
Oh, well that's kinda
too bad you don't know.

346
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,593
Is there someone you
have feelings for, Nao?

347
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,726
Huh? No, no, not really.

348
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,426
Oh...

349
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,626
[NAO]
Chito GPS, huh?

350
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,926
So, where did
she take you?

351
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:44,559
Hmm, it's a long story.

352
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:46,459
(Meow!)
What is it?

353
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,226
This time, are you
really going to take us

354
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:49,826
somewhere interesting?

355
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:50,726
(Mwor!)

356
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,326
Can I maybe come
with you guys?

357
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,693
Of course.

358
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,926
Huh.

359
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:00,693
[NAO]
There she is!

360
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,693
(Mwooor!)

361
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,126
Oh?
Oh? You plan on digging here?

362
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,926
Oh?

363
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,026
Hm?

364
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,126
(Digging and scraping)

365
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,826
Oh!

366
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:19,526
Now this looks like it could
be quite interesting!

367
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:23,826
(Mwor...)

368
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:24,993
[BOTH]
Hmm...

369
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,593
(Gasp)

370
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,259
[NAO]
Is this... a time capsule?

371
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,293
Huh?!

372
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:31,559
(Mwooor...)

373
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,493
Chito, don't go messing
around with this!

374
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:36,193
This must be very
important to someone.

375
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,093
(Disgruntled meow)
I wonder who...

376
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,426
[MAKOTO]
Hey, everyone!

377
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,459
Welcome home.

378
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,059
Looks like you managed
to make it back.

379
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,959
Yeah, somehow.

380
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,259
(Tired sigh)

381
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,626
[KEI]
You seem tired.

382
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:55,726
Yeah, it was a
really long day.

383
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:58,393
Seems Chinatsu's tired, too.

384
00:20:58,493 --> 00:20:59,793
She's still napping.

385
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,159
(Light snoring)

386
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,459
[MAKOTO]
She just twitched.

387
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,293
Maybe she dreamt she
fell down the stairs.

388
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:09,426
Maybe she fell in
a pitfall instead.

389
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:12,393
(Snoring and grunting)

390
00:21:12,493 --> 00:21:15,726
Akane's been sleeping
too much, don't you agree?

391
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:16,859
Yeah.
