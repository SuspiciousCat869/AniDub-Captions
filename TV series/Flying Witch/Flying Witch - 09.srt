Wow, you guys really
are blessed here...

158
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,192
not that that's
a bad thing.

159
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,992
(breath) Let's take a look
at your fate for tomorrow?

160
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:05,626
Ah, good idea. That
will be interesting.

161
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:11,259
Alright then, let's begin...
First, take these stones and
hold them between your hands.

162
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,626
'kay.

163
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,492
Mm.

164
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:18,726
Then, if you would please drop
the stones inside the circle
while thinking to yourself,

165
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:21,226
"Please tell me my
fortune for tomorrow."

166
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:24,359
[INUKAI]
Your fortune is based on each
stone's type and placement.

167
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,659
Cool!

168
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,459
What's the name for
this style of reading?

169
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,259
[INUKAI]
It's called
Stone‐throwing.

170
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,992
Oh, that figures.

171
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,226
Alright.

172
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,959
(concentrating)

173
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,159
[MAKOTO]
Oh!

174
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,059
[CHINATSU] Ah!
[MAKOTO] Hmmm...

175
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:43,726
Odd or even, guys?!

176
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,292
How do you even
know that?

177
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,826
I saw it on TV
the other night.

178
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,626
The guy was like, "You lousy
cheat. You'll pay for this!"

179
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:52,392
[KEI] Uh...
[MAKOTO] So what's
it say, Inukai?

180
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,026
Hmm...

181
00:08:55,126 --> 00:09:00,426
[INUKAI]
The stones are indicating: trip,
element of surprise, unneeded,

182
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,526
creativity, problem,
reunion, and gift...

183
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:11,292
Umm... I dare say that when
you head out tomorrow you'll
be met with an unexpected
ordeal that arises.

184
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,026
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Hmmm...

185
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:16,492
But when you overcome it,
you'll be awarded with a
fantastic result

186
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,859
that will help you
grow... So I think.

187
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,026
Ah...I wonder if something's
going to happen at school
tomorrow.

188
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,459
[KEI]
Yeah, maybe.

189
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,359
Alright then, Chinatsu,
you're next.

190
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,092
(excited) Yay!

191
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,926
(excited)

192
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,659
(concentrating)

193
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,726
Ha!

194
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,592
[MAKOTO] Hmh.
[CHINATSU] Hm?

195
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,559
Hmm...Now let's see...

196
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,959
[INUKAI]
Two‐facedness, trip,
tradition, the dark unknown,

197
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:53,559
folly, meaningless, and
treasure. I see, I see...

198
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,792
There will be an incident that
allows you to uncover a new side
of yourself.

199
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:02,226
[INUKAI]
In the end, I see that it will
become something you honor and
treasure with respect.

200
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,559
Wow.

201
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,626
That's a really good
reading, Chinatsu.

202
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,659
Thank you! Not that
I know what it means!

203
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,326
Well, it's time
for Kei.

204
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,659
[INUKAI] Ah... if you study
hard, it looks like you'll
score well.
[KEI] (pleased)

205
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,859
Hmh! Ah! Inukai is back
to her beautiful self.

206
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,559
Uh? Oh...

207
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,926
[MAKOTO] Ah, our
beautiful Inukai.
[INUKAI] Wha..?

208
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,692
You're right. Beautiful
Inukai is back.

209
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,759
(nervous intake) What's with you
guys? You're freaking me out.

210
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:31,459
Well... it's starting to get
pretty late, so I think I'll
get going now.

211
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,826
(soft mew)
(terrified squees)

212
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,359
See ya later!

213
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,859
Thanks again, guys.
Say "hi" to Akane.

214
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,326
[CHINATSU]
I'm heading out.

215
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,292
I hope our fortunes
come true.

216
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,392
I've got butterflies
in my stomach.

217
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,426
What does a new side
of myself mean anyway?

218
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:04,426
Maybe I should have
changed my hairstyle.

219
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:05,959
An unexpected ordeal...

220
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,392
[MAKOTO]
Whatever happens, I've
got to overcome it!

221
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,059
[KEI]
(nervous) U‐uh...

222

(courtyard chatter)

223
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,726
A bit small, don't you think?

224
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,159
[NAO] (angry huff)
[MAKOTO] Oh!

225
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,926
No no, I didn't
mean those.

226
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:25,559
[MAKOTO]
I was just thinking that your
bento is kind of small today.

227
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,026
Yeah... yeah, I know.

228
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,292
Cause you see, I've put
on weight recently.

229
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:35,292
Huh? You look the same as
you always do. Maybe you're
getting a bit taller.

230
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,992
Yeah, well I'm not
so sure about that.

231
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,559
In any case I'd like
to get a bit slimmer,
so I'm on a diet.

232
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,026
It's not good for your
body if you don't eat.

233
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:47,292
My grandmother always told me,
a healthy body makes girls more
attractive to look at.

234
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:50,692
She would actually tell you
that kind of stuff? Your own
grandmother?

235
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:55,026
She also told me that having a
bit of meat on your bones makes
you more popular with the boys.

236
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,459
[NAO]
For real?!

237
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,792
I guess I better eat up.

238
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,626
Do you want some
of my omelet?

239
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,892
Sure, that'd be great.

240
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,159
[MAKOTO]
That was a nice meal.

241
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,892
(GIRLS chattering)

242
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,059
[MAKOTO]
Are you free later today?

243
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,259
[NAO]
Yeah.

244
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,092
[MAKOTO]
Wanna come over to my place?

245
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,726
[NAO]
Oh, sounds good.

246
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,159
Excellent. I've been raising a
bunch of vegetables at home.

247
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,926
Oh yeah? That's
pretty cool.

248
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,059
Right now, I have flowers
blooming from my edamame plants.

249
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,292
[MAKOTO]
Have you seen Edamame
flowers before?

250
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,092
Uh...No, I haven't.

251
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:30,692
They're just the most
adorable little flower.

252
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,459
I would love for you
to come see them.

253
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:35,992
You know, sometimes
I have to wonder,

254
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,459
if you really are just
a girl in high school?

255

to my grandma.

Huh? Your big sister?

Wha...? I didn't know
you had a sister.

[MAKOTO]
Right?

275
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,008
I'll give you some edamame
when they're ready, kay?

276
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,774
You mean it?
Thank you so much.

What else do you
plant in here?

278
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:46,108
Ummm oh! I planted crops
that are supposed to be
good for beginners,

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,341
such as tomatoes,
bell peppers and corn.

280
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,841
[NAO]
Awesome. I just
love tomatoes.

281
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:55,074
[MAKOTO]
Ah, that's not all. Over
there is that mandrake I
pulled up before.

283

[NAO]
That... really loud one?

284
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,374
[MAKOTO] That would be the one.
I read in one of my witch books

285
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:09,341
that if you plant the part with
the leaves a new mandrake will
grow in its place.

286
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,141
I'm testing it out right now.

287
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,208
You're trying to
make more of them?!

288
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:17,108
[MAKOTO] Yeah, they are very
valuable after all.

like to take it home with you?

No thanks.
