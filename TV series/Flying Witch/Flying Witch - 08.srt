It sure is.

We need to bring Nao with us

Totally!

Okay.

Welcome home, Anzu.

[ANZU]
Thank you.

[ANZU]
Uh?

00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,838
What's with the mask?

Oh, sorry.

you fine here on your own?

[HINA] Yes.

Anzu, there are
customers inside.

Already? He's early today.
Did he order his usual?

00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:09,104
[HINA] Uh, no. Actually, he
hasn't arrived yet.

23
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,438
[ANZU] Oh?
[CHINATSU] It truly
is delicious!

24
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,371
Can I get
one more?

25
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:14,238
[MAKOTO]
I don't know
about that...

You can really
shovel it in.

I'm a growing girl with
a healthy appetite!

28

[KEI]
Sure you're not just a glutton?

29
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,571
Not what I expected...
Mhmm.

30
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:26,204
[HINA]
I think that girl with
long hair is a witch.

31
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,571
Uh? She's
not familiar.

32
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:32,471
Perhaps she might be the
beginner witch that has
recently moved up here?

33
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:33,671
Ohhh.

34
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:36,071
It appears she's a fellow
witch around your age,

35
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,738
maybe you two should get
to know each other.

36
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:42,004
Yes, I'll go and say hi.

37
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:43,638
[ANZU] Welcome.
[MAKOTO] Oh!

38
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,338
[ANZU]
Would you care for a
refill on your tea?

39
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:50,104
Ah...would you happen to be
the resident witch of this
establishment?

40
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,104
[ANZU]
Um...well...I guess.

41
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,838
[MAKOTO] Wow! (happy sounds)
[ANZU] Oh? Uhhh..?

42
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:57,171
Pleased to meet you!
This is great!

43
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,238
Thank you. You, too.

44
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,438
Hi my name is Makoto Kowata.

45
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:04,671
I've been training here as a
beginner witch since April.

46
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,704
Ah, so you're
the new witch.

47
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,704
These are my two relatives,
Chinatsu and her brother Kei.

48
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:13,904
I've been staying at their
family home, while training
to become a full witch.

49
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,471
[CHINATSU] Nice to meet you.

50
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,938
[KEI]
Likewise.

51
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:21,004
Anzu Shiina.
Pleased to meet you.

52
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:22,538
[ANZU] Hold on?
[MAKOTO] Huh?

53
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,904
[ANZU]
You said "Kowata."
Are you related to Akane?

54
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,404
Yes, Akane is
my older sister.

55
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,071
Ah.

56
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,704
I heard from my sister
that you are quite the
skilled and gifted witch.

57
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:37,504
It would be such a great
honor to learn from you.

58
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:38,804
Mm?

59
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,504
I'm not so special.

60
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:44,504
Oh come on now. There's
no need to be humble.

61
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,838
Uhh...

62
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,704
I can feel it. Your
aura is so powerful.

63
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:52,838
You will do great
things. Amazing!

64
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:54,438
What are you sayin'?

65
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:57,938
[ANZU]
Well anyway...please relax
and enjoy your time here.

66
00:04:58,038 --> 00:04:59,804
[MAKOTO]
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:03,771
[ANZU] Hmm?

68
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,304
How'd it go?

69
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,538
Ah...now I get it.

70
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:08,204
Huh?

71
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,638
[ANZU]
That girl...

72
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:11,571
she mistook me for my mother.

73
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,071
[HINA]
Oh my!

74
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,604
[HINA]
Come to think of it, she
asked about the owner.

75
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:18,404
[ANZU]
Well, if Mom comes
let her know, okay?

76
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:21,138
Alright. I'm going
to go prepare this.

77
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,838
Did you get some good stuff?

78
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,071
[ANZU]
Yes.

79
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,838
[ANZU]
They're bigger than last week's.

80
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:28,438
I'm sure he'll be
pleased with them.

81
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,804
[KEI]
So that girl is a skilled witch?

82
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,904
[KEI]
She's seems even younger than
us, don't you think?

83
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,704
[MAKOTO] No, I don't.
[CHINATSU KEI] Hmh?

84
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,171
I think at her age it
would be quite difficult

85
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,971
to use magic to change the
appearance of a building.

86
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:47,104
[MAKOTO] I bet she's also
using magic to make herself
appear younger than she is.
[KEI] Seriously?!

87
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,504
[MAKOTO]
I've heard that some
witches use magic

88
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:52,671
to make themselves appear
younger by looking like
they're just wearing makeup.

89
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:56,171
What? Cool! I'd
like to try that!

90
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,771
You're plenty
young enough.

91
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,804
[CHINATSU]
So does that mean she's
actually an old woman?

92
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:02,004
[MAKOTO]
Could be.

93
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:04,104
[KEI]
She did seem quite dignified.

94
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:05,204
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
I'm home.

95
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,638
[HINA]
Welcome home.

96
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:09,604
I apologize for asking
you to look after the cafe.

97
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,171
[HINA]
Not at all.

98
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,204
[HINA] Um...
[ANZU'S MOTHER] Yes?

99
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:18,038
[HINA]
We currently have some
customers,

100
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,871
including a beginner witch
who would like to meet the
owner of the cafe.

101
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:23,571
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Okay. I'll go say hi.

102
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:24,804
[MAKOTO]
Excuse me.

103
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,971
[MAKOTO]
Where can I find the restroom?

104
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,338
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Welcome!

105
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:29,571
Oh!

106
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:30,504
(dumbfounded)

107
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:31,771
Hmm?

108
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:34,604
Eh?

109
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:35,938
Oh?

110
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,971
[MAKOTO]
Um...Are you Ms. Shiina?

111
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,771
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
In the flesh, and you?

112
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:44,504
Uh?! (freak out)

113
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,804
[MAKOTO]
Oh no! Ms. Shiina!

114
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,938
Yes dear?

115
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:49,438
Um, are you quite
alright, ma'am?

116
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,371
Your magic...it seems
to have worn off.

117
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,271
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Oh dear...you mean the
cafe's magic?

118
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,904
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Don't worry, that's normal.

119
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,971
It changes back to looking run
down after people have entered.

120
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,738
[MAKOTO]
No no, not that, ma'am. I think
it's gotta be your height, or
maybe your age.

121
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,338
I just get the feeling
you're taller now than
when we first met.

122
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,404
[ANZU] Hina.
[HINA] Hmm?
[MAKOTO ANZU'S MOTHER] Huh?

123
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,471
[ANZU]
I can't find that
plate anywhere.

124
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:13,938
[MAKOTO] Oh...
[HINA] What plate?

125
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,104
[ANZU]
The red plate.

126
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,571
I'd like to serve
some food on it.

127
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,438
[HINA]
Ah... that one is
on the top shelf.

128
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:20,838
(MAKOTO freaking out)
[KEI CHINATSU] huh?

129
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:22,138
[MAKOTO]
T‐there are two of you!

130
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,638
Two of you! One! Two! One!

131
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,004
[ANZU] Uhhhh...
[MAKOTO] Magic? Ninjutsu?
(more freaking out)

132
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,004
[ANZU'S MOTHER] Ehehhh...
(MAKOTO freaking out)

133
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:32,071
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Are you okay?

134
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:35,904
[AKANE] All finished!

135
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:39,304
Alright! Time to try
this out somewhere safe.

136
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:45,771
[AKANE] Kenny.

137
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:48,438
Mraow!

138
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,071
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
(laughing)

139
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:57,738
Oh, now I get it.

140
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:01,738
You thought I was actually
Anzu posing as a young witch.

141
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:03,204
[ANZU]
I figured.

142
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:05,138
[MAKOTO]
I'm very sorry about that.

143
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,704
I didn't know you were
mother and daughter.

144
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,271
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
(laughing) It's quite alright.

145
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,738
You two really look alike!

146
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:13,971
Thanks.

147
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,171
What do you think?

148
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:16,604
How do you like
our cake here?

149
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,938
It is the most delicious
cake I've ever tasted!

150
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:21,771
Ohhh, that's great to hear.

151
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,204
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
You hear that, Hina?

152
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,538
[HINA] (embarrassed)
[ANZU'S MOTHER] Good for you.

153
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,304
[CHINATSU] Did Ms. Ghost
bake it herself?

154
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,771
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
That's right. And
her name's Hina.

155
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,304
[HINA] (embarrassed
to mortified)

156
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:31,971
(pinging sound)
[KEI] (surprised)

157
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:34,204
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
(laugh) She's a bit shy.

158
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,704
[MAKOTO]
Ms. Shiina, can I...?

159
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:37,204
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Yes dear?

160
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:40,038
How long ago did this cafe
first open for business?

161
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:42,371
I guess, around 200 years ago.

162
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,338
[MAKOTO]
A whole 200 years...

163
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:47,304
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Yeah...it has long
been a meeting place

164
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,938
for those on the
other side to gather.

165
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,538
The other side?

166
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,438
...You mean like ghosts and
other things like that?

167
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:58,704
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Exactly. That's why we witches
use magic to hide the cafe.

168
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,704
Lest normal people walk in
and witness the strangeness.

169
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:05,404
Ah! Does the Harbinger of Spring
perhaps come and eat here, too?

170
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,538
Yeah, he does. I see
you know of him?

171
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:11,271
[CHINATSU]
I'm actually an
apprentice witch.

172
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,271
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Oh, congratulations.

173
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,504
He's the coolest.
What does he eat?

174
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:18,304
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
He got his hands on something
really good last time.

175
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:22,504
Brought out a rare mandrake.
Hina was able to brew a
delicious tea.

176
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,704
[MAKOTO]
Ah?

177
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,938
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Did you perhaps give it to him?

178
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,038
[MAKOTO] Yes.

179
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,038
Great job extracting the poison!

180
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,671
Hina was really able to
bring its sweetness out.

181
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,238
Sweetness, huh?

182
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,138
I've never been able to brew
anything sweet from a mandrake,

183
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:37,838
it always tastes bitter to me.

184
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:41,171
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Hina has her own special
brewing method she uses.

185
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:45,471
[MAKOTO]
Oh, that's amazing. Please,
would it be alright if I learned
it from her sometime.

186
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,638
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Sure, I'll have her teach you.

187
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:49,438
[KEI] Pardon...
[ANZU'S MOTHER MAKOTO] Hmh?

188
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:53,071
[KEI]
Um... Is it a problem for
me to be hearing all this?

189
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:55,438
I'm just a regular guy.

190
00:09:55,538 --> 00:10:00,638
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
It's quite alright. You're
hanging around witches, so
you're actually not so normal.

191
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,871
[KEI]
Oh? You serious?

192
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,171
[KEI] Sis... It seems I'm not a
normal guy anymore.
[CHINATSU] Huh?

193
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,338
[CHINATSU]
(giggles) That's pretty cool.

194
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,638
[ANZU]
Oh?

195
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,038
[ANZU]
Welcome my friends.

196
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,371
[MAKOTO]
Those Ladybugs?

197
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,976
Welcome back.

198
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,976
[MAKOTO]
Are they customers?

199
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,643
Yeah, they're
regulars.

200
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:47,910
[HINA]
Anzu...

201
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,343
Wow! Look!

202
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:56,976
[ANZU]
Thanks for waiting.

203
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,743
[ANZU]
Take your time and enjoy.

204
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,376
[CHINATSU]
So they eat flowers?

205
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:12,343
Yes...they tell me that
thistle is their favorite.

206
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,310
So you're able to
talk with them?

207
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,443
[ANZU]
Well, Mom can.

208
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:20,243
[MAKOTO] Wow...she's amazing!
[ANZU'S MOM] You two
are so close.

209
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:24,810
[KEI]
Are they... together?

210
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,743
[MAKOTO]
Is one male and
the other one female?

211
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:30,843
[ANZU]
Yep. Apparently, this is
one of their date spots.

212
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,610
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Ehhh...

213
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,643
[MAKOTO]
I wonder if they're
speaking right now?

214
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,610
[KEI]
And what are they saying?

215
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,710
[CHINATSU (MALE BUG)]
Delicious, simply delicious.

216
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,043
[CHINATSU (FEMALE)]
Is it tastier than my cooking?

217
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:47,210
[CHINATSU (MALE BUG)]
I couldn't possibly
compare the two.

218
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,743
Where'd you come
up with that?

219
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:50,376
This is so relaxing.

220
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,510
[ANZU]
Did you know that ladybugs
bring happiness

221
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,776
to whomever they
choose to land on?

222
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:55,976
[CHINATSU KEI MAKOTO]
Huh?

223
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,910
(CHINATSU excited)

224
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:01,243
(MAKOTO getting up)

225
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,210
(determined)

226
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,510
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Wah!

227
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,976
Huh?

228
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,876
(CHINATSU jumping and straining)

229
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,576
(MAKOTO straining)

230
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:15,943
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
(trying very hard to
touch the ladybugs)

231
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,176
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Huh...

232
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,943
Hey thanks...appreciate it.

233
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:21,843
Almost...

234
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:22,876
Mm‐hm.

235
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,210
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Huh?!

236
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,943
(MAKOTO CHINATSU straining)

237
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,276
[ANZU'S MOTHER] Eh!
[KEI] Over here!
[MAKOTO CHINATSU] Huh?

238
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,110
(KEI pointing)

239
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,976
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Oh?

240
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,843
[MAKOTO CHINATSU]
Wha...! (running)

241
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,443
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
(small giggle)

242
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:49,610
(trying to get the
ladybugs attention)
(CHINATSU laughing)

243
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,343
Thank you very much
for visiting.

244
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,576
(KEI laughing at those fools)

245
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,976
[MAKOTO]
They didn't try to
land on any of us.

246
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,876
[CHINATSU]
That's too bad!

247
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,143
[KEI]
Excuse me. Do those ladybugs
pay for their food?

248
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:16,510
Well not with cash. But instead,
they get rid of all the bad bugs

249
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,010
that are feasting in
the fields around here.

250
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,710
[KEI]
Oh, like aphids?

251
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,910
Right. And that's good since
we have a kitchen garden.

252
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,110
I wonder if that means they're
out there protecting my garden
from bad bugs, too?

253
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,676
They probably are.

254
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,376
[MAKOTO]
Wonderful! I'm grateful
for your assistance.

255
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:45,876
[ANZU'S MOTHER]
Welcome.

256
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,143
[MAKOTO] I'm grateful,
so grateful.
[CHINATSU] Oh! Uh!

257
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,310
(CHINATSU scared yelp!)

258
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,976
[KEI MAKOTO] Huh?

259
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,876
[CHINATSU]
Ohhhhh?

260
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:54,076
[KEI] A g‐ghost...?

261
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,643
[ANZU]
No, that's the Veil.

262
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:58,143
[MAKOTO] Oh? Incredible!
[CHINATSU] What's the Veil?

263
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:02,343
[MAKOTO]
This is the first
time I've seen her.

264
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,476
[MAKOTO]
I take it she would be
the Veil of Night?

265
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,743
[CHINATSU]
What does this Veil of Night do?

266
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,110
[MAKOTO]
She's the one who
ushers in nighttime.

267
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,276
Wha? WOW!

268
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,210
[ANZU]
She's a regular
customer of Hina's.

269
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,743
She doesn't have much to do
until the evening, so she
comes here for tea.

270
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,976
[CHINATSU] (impressed)
[KEI] ...She seems quite
dignified.

271
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,343
[CHINATSU] (run giggling)

272
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:33,643
[CHINATSU]
What are you reading?

273
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,243
Mhm!

274
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,276
Oh... Uh...

275
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,710
[KEI]
Is it okay if she talks
to her like that?

276
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,076
It's fine, she's a very
kind and loving being.

277
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,643
[CHINATSU] Thanks!
[KEI] Oh?

278
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:53,076
[CHINATSU]
(slight laugh) I have candy!

279
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:56,010
[MAKOTO] Ohhh... Nice!
[KEI] Cool!

280
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,776
[MAKOTO]
Good for you.

281
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,043
[HINA] (smile)

282
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:01,210
(scratching on door)
[HINA] Oh!

283
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,176
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Oh?

284
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,343
[ANZU]
Ah, he's here.

285
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:04,843
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Huh?

286
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,210
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Oh...

287
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,576
(door opening)
[ANZU] Welcome.

288
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:23,676
Welcome.

289
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,210
[MAKOTO CHINATSU KEI]
Oh...

290
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,543
[ANZU]
Hello.

291
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,243
The usual today?

292
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,610
Hina.

293
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,610
Here you go.

294
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,910
[ANZU]
Please enjoy the food.

295
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,743
It's not so easy getting a hold
of these during this time.

296
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:54,110
[MAKOTO] Excuse me, Anzu?
[ANZU] Oh?

297
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,776
Can we...

298
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,243
Can we come a bit closer?

299
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:06,106
[ANZU]
Go ahead.

300
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,239
Wow!

301
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,939
What food is
he eating?

302
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,373
They're lantern fruits.
