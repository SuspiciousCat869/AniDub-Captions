(Light chuckle)

326
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,053
So...
Ah?

327
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:54,153
does that mean there's
a fair number of witches

328
00:16:54,253 --> 00:16:55,453
hangin' around?

329
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:56,886
Yeah, there's quite a bit.

330
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,520
In particular, the Tohoku
region has plenty around.

331
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,986
Yeah?

332
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,753
[MAKOTO]
There's lots of nature
and so many resources.

333
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:05,786
It's said to be easier
to use magic here,

334
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,120
so it's popular with
beginner witches.

335
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,986
I‐I had no idea.

336
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,020
Huh...?

337
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,020
Oh, wait...

338
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,753
Huh?

339
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,486
A second ago...

340
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:19,786
you said that there were
a lot of witches

341
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,586
in the Tohoku area,
right?

342
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:23,453
Yeah...

343
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:24,753
Okay then...

344
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,520
So why don't any
ordinary people like me

345
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,453
know anything about
their existence?

346
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:30,720
Does that mean they're keeping
the fact that they're witches

347
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,220
a secret from the
rest of us on purpose?

348
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,353
That's a good question.

349
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,853
I never thought about it.

me this now?!

00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,886
Alright, stop.
I've heard enough.

353
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:46,120
Don't get me mixed up in
any of your strange stuff.

354
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,653
I‐it'll be okay!

355
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,120
It's not like there's
a punishment or anything
for knowing about us!

[MAKOTO]
We're just supposed
to try our best

not heading home now?

go hang out with some of my
buddies from middle school.

I'm sorry, but you go on
and head back with Nao.

Oh...

I already asked her to
take you back to the house.

Hey! Make sure you take
good care of Makoto, okay?

Yeah, sure.

Cool, I'm outta here.

am I suppose...

I'm sorry for the trouble.

Having to take me all
the way to Kei's house.

376

Well, I mean, he sure
didn't waste any time

heading out with his friends.

He does whatever
he feels like.

379
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,720
I guess that's true.

380
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,520
He hasn't changed a bit
from all those years ago.

Is that so?
Where is...

expect him to grow up.

Come on! Your sense of direction
can't be THAT bad, can it?

No, it's not like that at all!

There's something I want
to give you as a present.

391
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:13,553
What sort of present?

392

I want to apologize for
surprising you yesterday

for our new friendship.

No, really, I'm fine
with all of this.

You don't need to make a big
deal out of it, I mean it.

say thank you.

pretty close by now,

it makes when it's pulled
out of the ground,

Die from shock?

It's a highly
toxic plant,

but if you extract
all the poison,

it becomes a very
useful cure‐all.
