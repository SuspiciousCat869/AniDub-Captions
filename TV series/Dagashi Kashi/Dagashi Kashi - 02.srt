to eating <i>Kinako-bou</i>

When you take a bite,

00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,750
the stick shakes, which causes
the crumbs to fall off.

solution is very simple!

Well, uh. It's nothing special.

107

in my right hand like this,

hand underneath it

crumbs that may fall down.

[gasps]

158
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,958
We'll be careful.

159
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,541
There's hardly any risk at all.

160
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,000
Even knowing that,

161
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,416
I could never rush you into
that kinda thing, Hotaru!

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,833
[HOTARU]
Check it out!

163
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,708
Huh? Okay, what's that?

164
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,250
It's called <i>"Namaiki</i> Beer".

165
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,875
You dissolve the
tablets in water

166
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,250
and it looks like actual beer.

167
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,583
Pretty cool, huh?

168
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,708
I say we drink it and
pretend like we're adults.

169
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,916
Perhaps then we could
understand them better.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,666
I know it looks
like the real deal,

171
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,458
don't worry,
it's non-alcoholic.

172
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,250
Yeah. Exactly what I
was worried about!

173
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,750
Remember being small?

174
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,958
Your family would get
together for whatever reason.

175
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,125
Everyone would gather
around the table,

176
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,125
the adults would all
drink wine or beer.

177
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,666
But because you were a kid,

178
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,208
you had to drink juice
all by yourself.

179
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,458
Didn't it make you
feel kind of left out?

180
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,083
Not anymore!

181
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,583
Because now you can
join the grown-ups

182
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,708
by drinking some <i>Namaiki</i> Beer!

183
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,083
You sound like a commercial.

184
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,125
[HOTARU]
And so...

185
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,625
[HOTARU]
Drop it in,

186
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,916
then you just add
some water, like this.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,208
[gasps]

188
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,125
[KOKONOTSU] Whoa, it actually
looks like beer.

189
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,541
[HOTARU]
Of course it does!

190
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,750
Is this your first
time drinking <i>Namaiki?</i>

191
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,166
Uh, yeah.

192
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,291
I've heard of it before,
but we've never carried it here.

193
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,208
I guess there's a first
time for everything.

194
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,291
[HOTARU]
You don't say!

195
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,458
Allow me to show you the ropes!

196
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,916
Uh... Okay.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,041
[HOTARU]
Sweet!

198
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,541
Good to hear!

199
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,541
We can't drink without snacks!

200
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,583
Next, we toast!

201
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,208
Here's to our first
pretend drinking party!

202
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,416
Cheers, friend!

203
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh, cheers?

204
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Mm! Wow, tastes good!

205
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,166
The flavor is pretty similar to,
like, a soda or fruit juice!

206
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,250
Don't you agree?

207
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,291
--Oh.
--[HOTARU giggles]

208
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,583
Yeah, I agree.

I agree with your face,

Oh lookie, <i>Umaibou</i> !

[HOTARU] Mm? There's a
big hole in my cup.

I want another beer, please.

What? For real?

217
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,375
I told you we don't carry
that here, remember?

218
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,416
[sobs] Why are you so mean,
Koko-umai-bou?

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,750
I just wanna refill.

Aw, come on now, don't cry!

221

Wait, what if I find you
something else to drink instead?

222
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,416
I have so many regrets.

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,916
Let's see.

224
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,125
Look, Hotaru!
Do you like this flavor?

225
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,666
Geez. Are you fermenting
that beer yourself or what?

226
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,458
The service in this
bar totally sucks!

Hey, why'd you go away?

Come sit down and
let's have a drink!

Aah!

Huh? I didn't say you could
sit there. Talk about rude!

Uh. You literally just
told me to sit here.

not the sheep, baa!

This is kind of a bad

I do.

The gum was created by

Then you can use that
card to flip more cards.

00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,791
[HOTARU]
But I suppose I could try

480
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,958
and teach you at least
the basics behind it.

481
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,250
[KOKONOTSU]
You'd really do that?

482
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
[SAYA]
And so...

483
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,083
[smack]

484
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,541
[KOKONOTSU]
I can't do it.

485
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,541
Man, I suck at this move.

486
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,375
Don't give up just yet.

487
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,291
Honestly, I think
you're really close.

488
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Fine.

489
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,208
[HOTARU]
Adjust your wrist a little.

490
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,041
[KOKONOTSU]
'Kay, like this?

491
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,125
[HOTARU]
Yeah, go ahead and throw.

492
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,166
[KOKONOTSU]
All right.

493
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,625
Two flipper!

494
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,416
Or not.

495
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,791
[HOTARU giggles]

496
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,666
Now let's see.

497
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,750
Position the card here, like so.

498
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,041
Then you throw it
down diagonally.

499
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,875
[SAYA grunts]

500
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,041
[SAYA]
Diagonal Slicer!

501
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,083
[BOTH gasp]

502
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,166
Ha, ha. Kidding!

503
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,708
Hm?

504
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,375
[SAYA gasps]

505
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,916
Hey, look guys!

506
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,333
I think I just flipped over
three cards at the same time!

507
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,416
[BOTH gasp]

508
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,750
Is that hard to do?

509
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,291
[HOTARU]
Wow, Saya.

510
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,666
Come on, be honest!

511
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,083
[HOTARU]
Well...

512
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,666
I'll call you master.

513
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,708
Huh?

514
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,958
[HOTARU]
You win, Master Saya!

515
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,166
[SAYA]
Master?

516
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,583
And what? I win?

517
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,333
[HOTARU] Please take
me on as your student!

518
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,458
[SAYA]
Huh?

519
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
[HOTARU]
Master Saya!

520
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,666
[SAYA]
Question, Hotaru!

521
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,000
When you buy <i>Kinako-bou,</i>
how do you know if you've won?

522
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,625
[HOTARU] Easy, if the tip
of the stick is colored red,

523
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,375
then you're a winner!

524
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,625
[SAYA]
Oh! Way cool!

525
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,833
I wonder if coffee would
go well with <i>Kinako-bou?</i>

526
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,458
[HOTARU] Huh? Are you thinking
of a collaboration between

527
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,541
Café Endo and Shikada Dagashi?

528
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,750
[SAYA]
Uh, no. Not really.

529
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,500
[HOTARU]
There's no time to waste,

530
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,583
we need to see if <i>Kinako</i> goes
well with coffee right way!

531
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,958
[SAYA]
I didn't say that!

532
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:14,958
But, we could try.

533
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,333
[HOTARU]
Okay!

534
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,958
[BOTH] You guys should
try it together too!
