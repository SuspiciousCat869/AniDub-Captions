1
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:17,416
You never did say what brings
you all the way out here.

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,541
Uh, well, the thing is...

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,333
It started snowing
on my way home.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,500
So my train got delayed
and I'm stuck.

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,791
[HOTARU]
Hm.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,833
Ah, in that case, I guess
I'll wait with you.

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,750
[ANNOUNCER A] May I have
your attention, please?

8
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,291
Due to the inclement weather,

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,750
all delayed trains have
been officially canceled.

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,125
We apologize for
the inconvenience.

11
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,875
[KOKONOTSU groans]

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,625
Looks like we're staying here.

13
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,208
[KOKONOTSU] I can't believe
it's really Hotaru.

14
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,625
After all this time,
she's just here.

15
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,375
There are so many
things I wanna ask her,

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,000
but I don't know where to start.

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,791
What should I say?

18
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,791
[gasps]

19
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:06,416
So, uh, anyway,
what's up with you?

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,791
Like, what were
you doing, Hotaru?

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,625
Just some business stuff.

22
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,750
Too bad the trains got canceled.

23
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,708
That's not what I meant.

24
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,416
All these months,
what have you been doing?

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,333
[HOTARU]
Let's see.

26
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,875
All kinds of things, I suppose.

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,083
Mostly helping the
family business.

28
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,916
Nothing outta the ordinary.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I bet you did a ton of things
while I was gone, huh?

30
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,750
With Endo and Saya,
and the shop, too.

31
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,583
You'll have to tell me
all about it sometime.

32
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,750
[KOKONOTSU] I went to the
shrine and the bus stop.

33
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:47,000
I went to a lot of places,
but no one was ever there.

34
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,291
I found myself wondering
if you really existed.

35
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:54,333
As dumb as that sounds,
it's still a thought I had.

36
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,333
You should've said
something before you left.

37
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,541
Kokonotsu.

38
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,708
[KOKONOTSU] I did do a ton of
things while you were gone.

39
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,833
Our shop was in real trouble,

40
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,583
and then a new store
opened up near us.

41
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,250
Just when things
were getting better,

42
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,791
and I was starting
to have fun again...

43
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:19,541
...I realized that I had put my
dreams on hold, so I panicked.

44
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,916
I had my manga reviewed
by an editor today.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,541
It was the first time a
professional looked at my work.

46
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,958
But it was a disaster.

47
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,708
And I kinda wanna...
wanna give up.

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,041
[KOKONOTSU] Dammit. This
isn't what I wanted to say.

49
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,625
Why am I taking out all
of my problems on her?

50
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,333
I wanted to show her that I
had changed for the better

51
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,541
since last summer.

52
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,916
But now I just look pathetic.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,833
[HOTARU]
I see.

54
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,000
[gasps]

55
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,208
[HOTARU]
And I have the answer.

56
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,708
It's a power-up of sorts.

57
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Wait, I know this lead-in.

58
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,458
It's <i>dagashi</i> time.

59
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,958
Behold! Super Mario- <i>kun</i>
Comic Chewing Gum!

60
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Totally called it.

61
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,458
Wait, it's the Super
Mario- <i>kun</i> Comic Gum?

62
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,791
Yep!

63
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,583
Not only do you get to enjoy
some delicious gum,

64
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,125
you also get a chapter
of the Mario- <i>kun</i> manga!

65
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
There are ten chapters
all together,

66
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,541
and one of those chapters
is exclusive to the gum!

67
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Awesome!

68
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,708
Attach it here.

69
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,375
No way! It's just
like a real manga!

70
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,541
[HOTARU] Having to assemble
it makes it feel kind of like

71
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,958
putting together
a toy model, huh?

72
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,166
By the way, did you know it's
distributed by Top Seika?

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,708
They make Scary Story Gum, too.

74
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,041
It's pretty
appropriate, isn't it?

75
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,041
What's wrong? Are you okay?

76
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,166
Uh, yeah.

77
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,750
It's almost too appropriate.

78
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,500
[HOTARU, KOKONOTSU laughing]

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,541
What the--? Ah!

80
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,958
I'm so sorry! I'll stop crying!

81
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,916
[HOTARU]
You can stop crying on command?

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,333
That's impressive!

83
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,333
[KOKONOTSU] Sorry, Hotaru,
it's like all my feelings

84
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,583
are trying to escape via my
tear ducts or something.

85
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,791
[HOTARU]
Kokonotsu.

86
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

87
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,333
I'm happy for you
because you've had time

88
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,208
to seriously think about what
you want out of your life.

89
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,500
And I guess it's not my place

90
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,333
to tell you whether you
should give up or not.

91
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,875
But I think it's important
that you made a decision

92
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,750
and acted upon it.

93
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:45,541
Even so, the Kokonotsu I see,

94
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:49,958
doesn't look like he's ready
to throw in the towel just yet.

95
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:55,416
I'm still feeling kind of unsure
about some things, but I guess,

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,333
I wanted to sulk and
have my pity party.

97
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,875
Well, I think that's
important, too.

98
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,833
[HOTARU]
Hey, listen.

99
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,750
I'm sorry I left without
saying anything.

100
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,916
Anyway, now I'm back.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,958
Once again, it's
been a while, right?

102
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,750
Uh, yeah. Welcome.

103
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,000
Wait, wha--?

104
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,583
Holy wow! It's so
cold! I'm freezing!

105
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,833
Ah! That's right!
Thankfully, I came prepared!

106
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,416
You did?

107
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:33,333
[HOTARU]
Feast your eyes... on this!

108
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Seriously?

109
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,375
You packed an entire
suitcase full of Buta-men?

110
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,708
Talk about packing lightly.

111
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,166
[HOTARU]
Come on!

112
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,833
We can melt some of the snow
from outside in the kettle

113
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,333
to make hot water.

114
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,708
Then it's Buta-men time!

115
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,708
We may not be able to
leave until morning,

116
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,375
but we won't starve!

117
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,875
It's so cold.

118
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,625
Hurry up, then!

119
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,583
[KOKONOTSU] I still had a lot
to say, and a lot to ask.

120
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,833
[KOKONOTSU]
Hotaru!

121
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,916
I'm starting to wish I'd
packed a coat, y'know?

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,041
[KOKONOTSU] But when I
really thought about it...

123
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,625
[KOKONOTSU]
...I felt like...

124
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,583
...we had plenty of time.

125
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,833
It's morning already?

126
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,333
Where'd she go?

127
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,083
[KOKONOTSU]
Hotaru!

128
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,041
[KOKONOTSU]
Hota... ru!

129
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,208
[HOTARU]
Good morning. Are you okay?

130
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,833
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh, well.

131
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,500
Sometimes I wonder...

132
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,958
Ready for some good news?
The trains are running!

133
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,083
[KOKONOTSU]
What?

134
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,416
Yep! Let's go back
to Shikada Dagashi!

135
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,208
Hey, I'm back!

136
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:24,958
Ko--

137
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,791
Co--

138
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,250
It's Coconuts!

139
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,125
Jeez, what happened to
you? Did you get stuck?

140
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,041
Yeah. Sorry if I
worried you guys.

141
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,583
I was worried! I mean, you
never came home last night.

142
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,875
Knowing you, your phone's
probably dead, yeah?

143
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,041
[gasps]

144
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,000
Ah, man! It totally is!

145
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:44,916
[HAJIME]
Kokonotsu.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

147
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,041
I'm glad you're back.

148
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,125
Thanks, me too, Hajime.

149
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,166
It didn't go very well.

150
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,541
Even though everyone
worked so hard to help me.

151
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,333
No way, we were
happy to help you.

152
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,250
Besides, you can't succeed
without a few failures.

153
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,000
Cut yourself some slack, dude.

154
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, there's always next ti--

155
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,000
[HAJIME]
Huh?

156
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,041
[TO]
Uh.

157
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,875
It's been a while, but hi!

158
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,041
Wait, wha--?

159
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,083
Oh, wow! It really
is you, Hotaru!

160
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,416
Well, yes, I suppose I do have
distinct facial features.

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Since when do you
greet people that way?

162
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,166
[HAJIME]
Uh, Manager, I was wondering.

163
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,916
Yeah, what?

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,166
[HAJIME]
Is she a friend?

165
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,833
Right, I forgot to intro-- Ah!

166
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,583
[HAJIME gasps]

167
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,083
[HOTARU]
Hey, you.

168
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,750
Yes?

169
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,416
Did you call him "manager"?

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,208
[HAJIME]
Yeah?

171
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

172
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,625
[gasps]

173
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,541
Wait, it's not what
you think, Hotaru!

174
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,875
It's just temporary, I swear!

175
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,583
Stop that smug laughter
right now! I'm serious!

176
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,791
[HOTARU]
Aha!

177
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,416
I never doubted your
talent, Kokonotsu!

178
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,791
Accept fate!

179
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,041
I was certain this
day would come!

180
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:03,333
Now is the <i>dagashi</i> shop
of our discontent!

181
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,166
At last, the day has
finally arrived!

182
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,833
Kokonotsu, you're
the one I want!

183
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
[ALL]
Huh?

184
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,333
Say wha--? I'm not even
sure what that means!

185
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,666
[SAYA]
Me either.

186
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,541
[HAJIME] You sure are a
smooth operator, manager.

187
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,083
[HOTARU]
Precisely!

188
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,416
We can't let his talent for
smooth operation go to waste!

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,958
Uh, hold on.

190
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,333
Anyway!

191
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,166
What's up? The Snack Review
Dude is finally back!

192
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,500
[HOTARU]
For my company,

193
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,291
I need Kokonotsu more
than I could ever need Yo.

194
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,208
In fact, forget Yo!

195
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,250
Uh...

196
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,875
Wait, your company?

197
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,125
That's right.

198
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,291
I'm thinking of creating
my own snack company.

199
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,791
But to make my dream
come true, I need you!

200
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,291
And by you, I mean your
talent, of course.

201
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,833
Oh. Yo, Yo.

202
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,625
Whoa, hey, Dad.
When did you get home?

203
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:59,208
Oh. Uh, I think it was
around the "Forget Yo."

204
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,416
[BENIYUTAKA]
What's all this?

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,708
Kids hanging out at a <i>dagashi</i>
shop in broad daylight?

206
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,375
[gasps]

207
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,416
[HOTARU]
Uh.

208
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,791
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

209
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,875
[HOTARU]
Hello, brother.

210
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,666
[BENIYUTAKA]
Hotaru.

211
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,875
[HAJIME, TO, SAYA, KOKONOTSU]
Brother?

212
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,833
Who is this?

213
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,250
Hold on. What's going on?

214
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,958
[HOTARU]
His name is Beniyutaka Shidare.

215
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,500
He's my big brother.

216
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,625
He was supposed to take
over the Shidare Company.

217
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,666
I never expected to run
into you way out here.

218
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,666
Well, ditto. Where on earth
have you been all this time?

219
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,166
[yells]

220
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,208
[YO]
Hey!

221
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,083
I've been gone practically
this whole season

222
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,500
and no one even cares!

223
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,291
Now there's some guy with
a mouthful of a name here,

224
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,166
Hajime is still at
my son's mercy,

225
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,875
and Hotaru is trying
to headhunt Kokonotsu!

226
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,041
I'll never let you take him!
He's my successor!

227
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,500
Aw, just hear me out.

228
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,958
[BENIYUTAKA]
I'm afraid I must intervene.

229
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,416
[BOTH]
Huh?

230
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,166
Kokonotsu is the perfect
candidate to be a team leader.

231
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,791
Me?

232
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,958
As if!

233
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,833
No, he's the legendary
successor, dammit!

234
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,833
[SAYA] Hold on, what
about Coconuts' manga?

235
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,791
We have tons of manga!

236
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,875
What'll happen to the shop and
my job if the manager leaves?

237
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,000
No one asked me,
but I'll follow Hotaru.

238
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,666
[YO] Kokonotsu's true
destiny is here!

239
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,041
[SAYA] I didn't mean
he wants to read manga!

240
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,750
[BENIYUTAKA] He'd be far
better off at my store!

241
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,000
<i>Dagashi</i> is his true calling!

242
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,166
[OTHERS shouting]

243
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,458
[gasps]

244
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,333
He escaped!

245
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,625
[OTHERS gasp]

246
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,875
[yelling]

247
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,375
Uh! Just leave me alone!

248
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,416
Manager!

249
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,708
[SAYA]
Coconuts!

250
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,583
Looks like you've still
got a long way to go.

251
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,625
Better not give up, Kokonotsu!

252
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,583
[KOKONOTSU screams]

253
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,791
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey, Hotaru?

254
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,750
So, uh...

255
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,875
Here.

256
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,041
Will you hold onto it?

257
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,750
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

258
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,666
Because then I'll always
have a good reason

259
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,291
to come back to Shikada Dagashi.

260
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,625
Fine.

261
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,708
Okay!

262
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh! Hey! Be careful!

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,791
Which <i>dagashi</i> do you think
we should discuss today?

264
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,708
[SAYA]
It's way too dangerous!
