Okay. Let's start with
Mister Impatient.

A solid choice.

In that case,

00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,333
I'll use my favorite color,
peacock blue, for yours.

172
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,166
Squeeze a bit of the paint
in to the mixture.

And then stir, stir,
and stir some more!

around and shape it a bit.
