162
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,625
It's like I've been
saying all along.

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,500
[HOTARU]
If that's true, you must be Yo.

164
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,375
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

165
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,458
[YO]
Hm? Hm.

166
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,541
--[KOKONOTSU gasping]
--[HOTARU] Oo-wah!

167
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,541
[gasps]

168
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,583
[BOTH grunt]

169
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,208
You want some potato fries?

170
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,375
[HOTARU]
Yes, That'd be lovely.

171
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,958
[KOKONOTSU]
What the--? I'm so lost.

172
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,625
[YO] You just can't
beat potato fries!

173
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,166
[HOTARU]
Right?

174
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,833
Even though they're really thin,
they're packed with flavor!

175
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
The salt, the artery
clogging grease.

176
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,583
Staples for any foodie!

177
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,250
[YO]
Aw yeah, girl!

178
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,750
You know your stuff!

179
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,041
[HOTARU giggles]
Well, you do, too!

180
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,083
[YO laughs]

181
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,000
[sighs]

182
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,541
[HOTARU]
Oh hey, Kokonotsu.

183
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,875
Huh?

184
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,291
Do you want me to tell
you the most delicious way

185
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
to eat potato fries?

186
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh...

187
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,166
[HOTARU]
Here's what you do.

188
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,208
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

189
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,375
Careful with those.

190
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,666
[YO]
Hm!

191
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,333
[HOTARU] Eat them all
together in one shot!

192
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh...

193
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,875
--[gasps]
--[HOTARU] However.

194
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,666
This technique requires caution.

195
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,375
That spicy-spicy chicken
flavor is super-hot.

196
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,958
[YO]
Impressive!

197
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,916
She doesn't just like <i>dagashi,</i>

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,750
she's got a passion for it!

199
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,875
Kokonotsu.

200
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,541
I like your new girlfriend.

201
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,708
Girlfriend?!

202
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,916
Shut up, Dad!

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,291
Stop assuming things.
She's here for you!

204
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,333
I see.

205
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,250
You're from the Shidare Company.

206
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,458
Then that makes
this a tragedy.

207
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,708
If you two kids were going out,

208
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,416
our family business
would be secured.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,041
Wha--? Don't be ridiculous.

210
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,333
That's crazy!

211
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,833
Can you believe this guy?

212
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,958
Yes, I can.

213
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,250
[gasps]

214
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:30,458
Unfortunately, I'm already
in love with someone else.

215
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,083
Ah. Of course you are.

216
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,708
Oh? A secret crush?
Tell us, tell us!

217
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,208
I shouldn't.

218
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,625
[YO] Your secret's safe
with us, come on!

219
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,541
[HOTARU]
Okay...

220
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,458
Over there.

222
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,333
The guy I love
is in front of me.

223
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh...

224
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,083
Huh? What does this mean?

225
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,208
[HOTARU]
Yes. I'm in love with... Pocchi!

226
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,416
He's beyond adorable!

227
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,291
Ooh!

228
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't know he was your type!

229
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,416
Who'd have guessed?

230
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,041
He's just so cute!

231
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,666
His widdle sailor
suit is too much!

232
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
[HOTARU giggles]

233
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,958
Random topic change.

234
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,166
Didn't you say
you came to see me?

235
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,958
Yes. I did.

236
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,666
The thing is,
my father has a request.

237
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,208
He wants you to join
the Shidare Company.

238
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,541
I came to deliver the
message personally.

239
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,833
Get out, Dad!

240
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
I guess you're kinda
famous after all.

241
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,958
Way to go!

242
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,166
One more thing.

243
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,000
I need your answer
as soon as possible.

244
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:42,875
I refuse!

245
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,375
[gasps]
What?

246
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,791
Okay, I'll tell my father,
but would you mind explaining?

247
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,583
[YO] It's simple. I grew up
here at Shikada Dagashi.

248
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,875
This place is my whole life,

249
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,291
and until my son takes
over as the ninth owner.

250
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,458
I can't yield!
I'll stay strong!

251
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,833
[KOKONOTSU] Stop with the
guilt trip. I said no.

252
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,541
Don't say that, Kokonotsu!

253
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,875
It's so rude when your
dad loves you so much!

254
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,541
Not to mention you've
got the talent

255
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,083
for running a successful shop!

256
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,041
This is a golden opportunity!

257
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,916
I'm not really sure
what the big deal is,

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,916
but crying isn't gonna
make me change my mind.

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,291
[gasps]
How about this.

260
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:21,291
If I can convince Kokonotsu
to take over your shop,

261
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,125
then will you agree to
join the Shidare Company?

262
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Okay, sure!

263
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,208
[gasps]

264
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,333
You're gonna see
a lot of me, now!

265
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,500
A deal's a deal!

266
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,958
This'll be fun!

267
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,333
[giggles]

268
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh, what just happened?

269
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey To?

270
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,666
Let me ask you; do you
think my dad is famous?

271
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,916
For real?

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,458
You have to be kidding
me right now, Coconuts.

273
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,083
So, you do?

274
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,791
[TO] Honestly, dude?
He stands out, y'know?

275
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,000
Everyone in town knows
who your dad is.

276
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,125
So, it's that kind of famous.

277
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,875
Okay, what's bugging you?

278
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,000
[sighs]

279
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,916
Well we had a
visitor yesterday.

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,208
They asked for my dad.

281
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,708
Were they local?

282
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,625
No, I seriously doubt it.

283
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,291
If someone like
that lived here,

284
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,083
I guess they'd be
pretty famous, too.

285
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,875
Uh-huh. Very interesting.

286
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,125
[SAYA]
Kinda' strange, yeah?

287
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,750
Living out in the boonies means
we don't get many tourists.

288
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,916
[TO]
True enough, sis.

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
Here. For you.

290
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,750
Wow, it smells great, Saya.

291
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:24,541
[chuckles]

292
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,541
[gasps]

293
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,625
Oh. Thank you?

294
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,625
Hey, tell me more
about this visitor.

295
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,916
[KOKONOTSU sighs] Honestly, I
don't even know where to start.

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,875
Was it a girl?

297
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,375
[KOKONOTSU grunts]

298
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah...?

299
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,583
Awesome! Please tell
me she was hot!

300
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,666
[KOKONOTSU]
I guess, maybe?

301
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,916
She's pretty.

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
[TO]
Really?

303
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,583
Judging from your reaction I'd
say she's more than just pretty.

304
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,208
Uh-oh, Coconuts,
are you crushing on her?

305
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,125
[gasps] What? No, it's not
like that at all!

306
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,041
I just meant that
she's pretty strange.

307
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,750
[KOKONOTSU, TO]
Hm?

308
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,000
[gasps]
Scary!

309
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Hmph.

310
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,666
Hey, Saya? Could I have
some more coffee please?

311
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,500
With lots of extra sugar!

312
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,833
[SAYA]
Of course.

313
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,375
[KOKONOTSU]
U-Uh...

314
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,916
--[SAYA] You want extra sugar?
--[TO groans]

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,958
Well who am I to judge
if you like sweet things?

316
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,208
I'm only here to
serve you, right?

317
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,500
Just tell me when.

318
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,333
Is this enough for you, yet?

319
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,291
Don't be shy. Speak up!

320
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,375
Why do you need so much sugar?

321
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,583
Does my coffee taste bad?

322

[SAYA grunts] Didn't know
you liked sugar so much.

Next time just
order sugar cubes.

Don't force yourself.

You don't have to drink my
coffee if you hate it.

[gasps]
What? No!

335
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,708
The sugar just complements
your coffee, is all.

336
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,541
That's why I love it so much.

337
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,583
[KOKONOTSU] Truth is,
I'm not a big coffee fan,

338
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,625
but yours always
tastes really yummy!

339

Lucky me, without you guys
running this café, I'd miss out.

For sure. Good point.

[stutters, chuckles]

342
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,458
[SAYA] Well, since you like it,
I... can make you coffee.

343
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,458
You know, just, like, when
you're over here and stuff.

344
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,458
Sounds like a plan to me!

get going now, guys.

Okay.

Oh, Saya.

[KOKONOTSU]
Here ya go.

351
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,458
I almost forgot I
had them with me.

352
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,333
I brought them for you.

353
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,500
They're milk coffee
candies from our shop.

354
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,375
The pitch is,
"Even though it's candy,

355

the coffee flavor will make
you feel like a grown up!"

I realize you're not
really a fan of candy,

357
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,291
but you do like the taste
of coffee, don't you?

358
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,083
I thought maybe
you'd like 'em.

359
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,416
Thanks. I'll let you know.

What're you even talking about?

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,541
Did you know coffee candy
is like super sweet?

373
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,875
Cause it is.

374
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,041
Yeah, I know that.

[chuckles] My point is you
hate sweet stuff, Saya!

379
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,500
But not when Coconuts gives
it to you, am I right?

380
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,541
Then, you love it!

381
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
So? What does it matter?

382

It doesn't matter.

That is unless
you're crushing on him!

Shut up! It's not like that!

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,833
[HOTARU] I had to overcome
a great many obstacles,

483
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,291
but I found the legend
the king was talking about.

484
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,625
[HOTARU grunts]

485
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,083
[HOTARU] But then, in order to
gain the power of the legend,

486
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,958
I was forced into a
contract with him.

487
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,041
So, the quest began anew to
release the sealed power of

488
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,041
"the Successor who
inherits the legend."

489
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

490
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,500
My destiny prevents me
from leaving this town.

491
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,583
Not until I fulfill
my obligation.

492
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,208
I must succeed!

493
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,625
No offense, but I'm not
following this story at all.

494
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,958
[HOTARU]
Anyway!

495
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,958
It looks like I'll be staying
here in this town

496
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,000
for a little while.

497
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,333
Let's be friends!

498
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,041
Uh, sure. That sounds good.

499
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,500
[HOTARU giggles] I don't
care what I have to do.

500
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,083
I will gain the divine
power of the legend!

501
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,875
Do you hear me, Successor?

502
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,208
Prepare yourself
for an epic journey!

503
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,000
[KOKONOTSU sneezes]

504
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,666
[KOKONOTSU] Someone must
be talking about me.

505
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,916
[HOTARU]
So it begins!

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,291
[SAYA]
Yeah, I guess so!

507
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,791
How about a trivia question?

508
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,416
[HOTARU]
My body is ready!

509
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,375
[SAYA] Tell me the
correct title of this show:

510
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,875
"Daga Shikashi" or
"Dagashi Kashi"?

511
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,291
Which is the answer?

512
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,500
[HOTARU gasps]
The <i>Umaibou</i> was really yummy!

513
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,708
[SAYA]
Uh?

514
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,875
[HOTARU] But I also
loved the potato fries!

515
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,083
[SAYA] That wasn't
part of the question.

516
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,583
[HOTARU]
Oh!

517
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,291
I could have eaten a lot more
of those tasty donuts too!

518
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,791
[SAYA] Forget about the food!
What about the trivia question?

519
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,916
[HOTARU] Are you going to
eat those Milk Coffee Candies

520
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,541
he gave you?

521
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,458
[SAYA]
What?!

522
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,083
Um, maybe. Yeah?
