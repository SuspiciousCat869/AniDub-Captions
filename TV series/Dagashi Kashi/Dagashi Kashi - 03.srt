[HOTARU] Is your body

when exactly did
you meet Hotaru?

Nothing! Ah...

Get your mind out
of the gutter, man!

49
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,666
Anyway, I saw her
with this big heater.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,291
And I generously
offered to carry it here!

This unbearable heat is
a part of your training!

00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,666
Looks like the water
is finally ready.

67
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,125
[TO]
Yes!

68
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,291
Did you know that Butamen
has many different flavors?

69
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,291
There's pork bone broth,
soy sauce, salted beef tongue.

70
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,791
The list goes on.

71
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,875
Personally, I prefer the pork
bone broth over the rest.

72
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,416
Unfortunately,

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,833
Butamen tends to be pricier
than most of the other snacks.

74
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,375
Kids don't have a lot of money.

75
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,833
If they're buying noodles,
they have to be picky.

76
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,708
And no way is a kid going
to walk into a snack shop

77
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,041
and waste his money
on any old flavor.

78
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,041
In the end, they're likely
to settle on pork bone broth

79
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,333
because it's tried and true.

80

what any normal
human can endure.

83
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,625
True enough.

00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,291
It's called "go home!"

167
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,625
I'm not leaving, yet!
We only just got here!

168
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,833
--[whistle chirps]

169
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,500
[YO]
Hey, you kids!

170
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,541
No roughhousing by the pool!

171
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,958
I know that voice.

172
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,875
[YO] You could slip on the
tile and hurt yourselves!

173
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,958
Um, Dad?

174
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,250
Ah! It's you!

175
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,083
What are you doing here?

176
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,125
I could ask you the same thing!

177
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,791
--[whistles weakly]
--[KOKONOTSU] Huh?

178
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,333
Okay, fine.

179
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,208
Income from our shop hasn't
been enough to pay the bills.

180
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,458
It's so embarrassing.

181
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,750
[whistles weakly]

182
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,416
[YO] This is my side gig.
I'm working two jobs

183
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,125
and you're neglecting the
shop to play at the pool.

184
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,625
But the air broke down.
We were hot!

185
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,041
Of course. Another expense.

186
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,125
[whimpers]
Wow, I'm sorry, Dad.

187
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,458
Then you could help by
watching the shop tomorrow!

188
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,166
That changed your tune.

189
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,416
[SAYA]
Hm? Hello there!

190
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
[YO]
Hey, Saya!

191
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,333
I haven't seen you in a while!

192
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,083
What's all the commotion about?

193
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,041
You seem excited.

194
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,875
My son has just kindly agreed
to watch the store tomorrow!

195
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,166
I'm so happy,
I feel like dancing!

196
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,375
[SAYA]
Huh?

197
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,375
[KOKONOTSU]
You can ignore Captain Speedo.

198
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,375
Okay. But, um...

199
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,583
Hey, I don't see
Hotaru anywhere.

200
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,875
[KOKONOTSU] Oh! We thought she
might be with you, actually.

201
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,875
[SAYA]
No.

202
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,208
[giggles]
Hope she gets here soon.

203
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,833
I bet she looks hot
in her swimsuit!

Listen, perv. If you're weird
around her, I'll murder you.

207
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,916
Is that clear enough, bro?

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,041

Hey! Time to put in the

00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,833
Just go ahead and do your thing!

212
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,083
[HOTARU]
Okay!

213
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,125
[ALL]
Huh?

214
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,833
Look, guys, it's Hotaru!

215
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,666
Huh?

216
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
Hi, Master!

217
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,166
Oh man, why's she gotta
be wearing a hoodie?

218
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,041
[SAYA]
Were you here this whole time?

219
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,083
[HOTARU]
Yep!

220
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,458
[YO] Excellent, our plan
is working perfectly.

221
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,666
[HOTARU]
We got this, Yo.

222
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,208
What?

223
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,375
The boys are planning to go
hang out at the swimming pool?

224
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,208
Interesting. Well, in that case.

225
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,333
Once Kokonotsu
realizes how grave

226
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,541
our financial situation is,
he'll feel terrible.

[whimpers]
Wow, I'm sorry, Dad.

228

to help out more.

--[YO, HOTARU chuckle]
--[YO] A foolproof plan!

Alright! Screw this heat,
let's go swim!

Are you gonna swim too?

Yeah! Go ahead,
I'm right behind you.

"gifts" any minute now.

I found something!

There was a <i>Kuru Kuru Bou</i> Jelly
in the water, awesome!

You think somebody
dropped it in here?

Oh, that little
thingamabob?

249
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,916
Think of it like a bonus prize
for the pool guests to enjoy.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,833
It's my treat!

promotional item.

some freebie snacks.

Oh my gosh, me too! Look!
Must be my lucky day!

They're purple and blue!

258
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,708
I wonder what flavors
they're supposed to be.

259
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,166
[KOKONOTSU]
I know!

260
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,458
One is soda pop flavored,
and the other one is grape.

261
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,875
Oh, cool!

262
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,916
I think they have a cream
soda flavored option, too!

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,208
I'll look around and
try to find one for you!

264
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,416
[SAYA] We can share
them when we're done!

265

[YO] This was all part
of our master plan!

If we make <i>dagashi</i>
fun for Kokonotsu,

267
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,916
he'll wanna take over the shop!

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,208
When it comes to this girl,

269
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,000
she's not afraid
to pull any punches.

270
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,666
[chuckles]
This is perfect.

271

Hm?

no eating or drinking allowed.

[HOTARU]
Are you serious?!

274
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Well that sucks.

275
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,666
[TO] I guess we can't
eat these, after all.

276
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,791
[SAYA]
What a waste.

277

Oh hey, good morning!

285
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,291
[HOTARU] Did I show up
at the wrong store?

286
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,500
Are you looking for Coconuts?
He's running an errand,

287
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,000
so I'm watching the
shop until he gets back.

00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,166
Okay. I see.

289

Hm... Hm...? Hm... Hm!

Where's all the <i>dagashi?</i>

291
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,291
[TO] Well, he had
to move some of it.

292
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,625
When the AC broke,

293
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,083
he put the stuff that
might go bad in a cooler.

294
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,583
I'm impressed!
Which is no easy feat!

295
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,708
Do you have any idea
when he'll be back?

296
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,041
Uh, he should be
back any minute now.

297
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,916
[HOTARU] Okay. Do you mind
if I wait for him, then?

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,375
[TO]
Knock yourself out.

299

[video game beeps]

300
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,041
[HOTARU] I've wanted
to ask you something.

301
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,750
[TO]
Go for it.

302
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,250
I was just wondering what sort
of <i>dagashi</i> is your favorite.

303
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,166
Huh? Which is my favorite?

304
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,166
Yep! What do you like?

305
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,041
Uh... Mm... Hang on,
just let me think.

306
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,208
[HOTARU giggles]

307
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,000
I can't decide.

308
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,125
[HOTARU]
"Eye Candy-Side"?

309
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,750
[HOTARU grunts]

310
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,416
[HOTARU]
That's a strange name.

311
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,708
I don't think I've
heard of it before.

312
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,916
Kind of a dumb answer, huh?

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,416
[grunts]

314
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,916
[HOTARU] Usually I can tell
about someone's personality

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,291
based on their answer,

316
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,833
but this time my discussion
technique has failed!

317
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,625
And hey. Since we're
already on the subject.

318

Yes?

319
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,250
Do you have a
particular preference

320
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,791
when it comes to <i>dagashi</i> ?

321
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,000
My favorite?

322
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,416
[TO]
Uh-huh.

[HOTARU] A good question!
I love all <i>dagashi</i> equally!

326
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,333
If we were to pick a specific
genre, I could narrow it down.

327
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,083
Otherwise I could never
choose just one thing!

Wow.

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,875
[HOTARU] A perfect answer,
if I do say so myself!

330
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,208
So basically,

331
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,291
you kind of consider all
of them to just be okay?

The wrapper is made
from edible rice paper.

You don't take it off,
you just eat it!

00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,375
then you can expect the serving
size to be smaller, too.

482
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,291
Kids don't have a lot of money,
so if they spend it on candy

483
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,250
that's gone in an instant,
then it's a big letdown.

484
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,083
[HOTARU]
Basically.

485
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,291
Manufacturers have to extend
your time with the candy.

486
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,416
They need to learn to
balance fun, flavors,

487
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,333
and frugality all together.

488
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,416
[giggles]

489
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,916
Whoa.

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,666
So cool! You're beyond amazing!

491
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,916
Every time I'm around you,

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,166
I learn something
new and unusual!

493
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,666
You're so awesome!

494
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,458
What? You mean it?

495
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,500
[SAYA] Do you know
any other random facts?

496
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,166
[HOTARU chuckles]
Yes, I actually do!

497
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,625
[SAYA]
Yay!

498
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,458
[HOTARU] You know how
the Seven Neon packaging

499
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,666
has letters from the
alphabet on it?

500
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,958
Uh-huh?

501
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,083
[HOTARU] There are eight letters
in all, ordered from A to H.

502
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,083
Does it stand for
something interesting?

503
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,666
Well, I heard...

504
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,791
...that it means
absolutely nothing!

505
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,291
Wow! For real?

506
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,875
You see, the packaging may
have eight letters on it,

507
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:42,041
but it only comes with seven
pieces of candy in the bag!

508
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,708
That's totally weird when
you think about it!

509
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,250
[HOTARU chuckles]
I know!

510
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,500
Sometimes I think the
whole thing is a fluke!

511
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,291
[SAYA] Right? But it's
also a neat fact!

512
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,666
[TO]
See ya later, man!

513
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Bye!

514
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,333
Hey wait, come to think of it,

515
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,750
Hotaru never made her
way back here, did she?

516
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,291
[HOTARU] And that's the
"God's Left Hand" technique.

517
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,583
[SAYA]
Awesome!

518
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,083
You seriously are the
best at everything!

519
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,208
Well, I don't like to brag,
but yeah, it's true.

520
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,500
That's for sure!

521
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm...

522
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,375
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh, well.

523
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,875
[HOTARU]
Hey, Master!

524
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,583
Wanna hear the secret behind
what makes Butamen so tasty?

525
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,000
[SAYA]
Sure!

526
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,541
[HOTARU] Each flavor is riddled
with a different secret!

527
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,458
But the biggest secret
is in the powder!

528
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,541
The noodles are so yummy
because of the powder

529
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,041
and water they cook in!

530
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,708
The powder is produced by
simmering together meat, fish,

531
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,333
vegetables and seasoning!

532
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,291
I also heard that how they mix
the powder is super-secret!

533
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,541
It's like the most secret
of the secret-est thing

534
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,750
that ever secret-ed!

535
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,000
[SAYA] Whoa. That sure
is a lot of secrets.

536
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,583
[HOTARU]
Yeah! I know, right?

537
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,083
But that's what makes
them so darn delicious!
