00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,625
[BOY A]
My parents warned me about it.

2
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,291
The mysterious calendar
that was in our house.

3
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,916
We weren't allowed to touch it.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,250
As far as I knew, we never
actually used the calendar.

5
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,833
So I wondered why we
bothered to keep it at all.

6
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,333
I couldn't stop thinkin'
about that fact.

7
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:16,000
One day when my parents weren't
home, I decided to check it out.

8
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,083
[BOY A] The month of January
had a picture of a baby.

9
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,625
February's picture
was a small child.

10
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,000
March was a boy
playing baseball.

11
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,791
Since my birthday
was in December,

12
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:29,916
I flipped to the last page

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,916
to see what the picture
would look like.

14
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,750
[BOY A] The final page had
an image of an old man,

15
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,083
and his eyes were closed
as if he were dead.

16
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,666
It creeped me out, so I decided
to close the calendar,

17
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,166
but then...

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,833
...the old man's eyes
suddenly opened

19
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,875
and started crying
tears of blood.

20
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,166
Frightened, I let
go of the calendar.

21
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,791
But when I looked down,

22
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,541
my hands were covered
with the old man's blood!

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,666
When my parents returned,
I told them what I had done.

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,375
They had the calendar
exorcised and burned.

25
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,708
[BOY A]
Our family doesn't really talk

26
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,583
about that calendar anymore,

27
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,875
but I'll never forget the thing
that frightened me the most.

28
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,875
It was that the old man
on the last page...

29
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,208
...looked just like my grandpa.

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,708
What? Was it not scary?

31
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,750
Man. I thought for sure
you guys would be scared.

32
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,583
If that story doesn't scare you
with a typhoon raging outside,

33
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,750
then nothing will.

34
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:44,000
It's just... I don't
get the point of it.

35
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,875
Like, why was the kid's
grandpa drawn in the calendar?

36
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,916
Was his grandpa alive or dead?

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,416
Was the calendar
hand-drawn or printed?

38
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,625
I don't know.
Hand-drawn, maybe? Why?

39
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,500
Geez, Coconuts, who cares?

40
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,958
[HOTARU chuckles]

41
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,416
You're obviously way
overthinking the story.

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Not everything's going to
have a rational explanation.

43
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,166
Do ya get what I mean?

44
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,458
Endo can't explain
how the calendar works,

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,666
but it's the unknown

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,916
that often makes people
afraid of something.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,416
Yeah? Wouldn't you say?

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,416
Nah! Please,
I wasn't even scared!

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,791
Only a kid would be afraid
of such a lame story!

50
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,041
Seriously, half of it
didn't make any sense!

51
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,375
You'll have to try harder
if you wanna scare me!

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,208
Okay, fine.

53
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,333
I was just warming up.
My next story is even scarier.

54
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,375
[gasps]

55
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,500
[BOY B]
The past few months,

56
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:34,166
I've been suffering from
some mysterious illness.

57
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,041
I feel miserable all the time.

58
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,500
[coughing]

59
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,666
[BOY B] I've started to
run a high fever, as well.

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,791
My mother is worried about me,

61
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:50,458
so she decided to take me to
the hospital and see a doctor.

62
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,166
[DOCTOR] Well, I'd like
to run some tests.

63
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Routine diagnostics.

64
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,500
[BOY B] We went down to the
lab and had my blood drawn.

65
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:04,250
After that, we went to radiology
and took an x-ray of my chest.

66
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,583
We went back to
the waiting room.

67
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,875
Then, the doctor
came running in.

68
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,791
He told us they had
found something strange

69
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,583
on my chest x-ray.

70
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,916
[BOY B]
Nothing could prepare me

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,250
for what I would
see on the x-ray.

72
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,916
[gasps]

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,625
[BOY B]
It was the shadow...

74
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,416
...of an old man's face.

75
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,583
[screams]

76
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,666
Old people!

77
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,375
Stop it. To, you're
freaking out Saya.

78
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,083
Come on! It wasn't that scary.

79
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,958
I hate ghosts and creepy stuff.

80
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,166
[TO] What? But I thought
you weren't scared.

81
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,333
I'm not scared! Just
don't like ghost stories!

82
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,458
Aren't those two
things closely related?

83
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,708
[SAYA]
Stop teasing me!

84
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,750
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

85
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,125
You guys are jerks!
Not you, Hotaru.

86
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,541
Why do you even like those
dumb stories, Coconuts?

87
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

88
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,000
Honestly, I don't really
care one way or the other

89
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,125
about them.

90
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,708
I actually thought
you were having fun.

91
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,750
[SAYA]
Well I'm not having fun!

92
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,416
I hate ghost stories, okay?!

93
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,166
[TO]
Ha, ha. Calm down.

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,791
Besides, I still haven't
told you the ending yet.

95
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,000
You see, the old
man was actually--

96
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,750
Hell no! I'll turn
you into a ghost!

97
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,875
[ALL]
Uh?

98
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,000
[HOTARU]
It's okay, Master Saya.

99
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,208
Just listen, the story
actually has a happy ending.

100
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,458
See, when the boy was small,

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,375
he had to have a
lung transplant,

102
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,375
and the new lung came from
the old man he saw in the x-ray.

103
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,666
Oh. I guess that
kind of makes sense.

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,166
[HOTARU]
Yes.

105
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,541
The boy remembered he hadn't
visited the old man's grave

106
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,750
in a long time.

107
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,291
He felt bad about it.

108
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,833
So, the next day he went
with his mother to the grave,

109
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,583
and they prayed together.

110
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,916
And it worked!

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,333
The boy got better and
lived happily ever after!

112
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,791
Ahh...

113
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,000
[HOTARU]
That's how it goes, right, Endo?

114
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,291
Yeah! I'm not surprised
you knew the story, Hotaru.

115
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,333
I would be ashamed if I didn't.

116
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,541
Because both of the stories you
told came from the same package.

117
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,041
Which I just happen
to have on me.

118
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,541
It's Super Scary Story Gum!

119
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
Each package comes
with a different story,

120
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,750
and I'm proud to say
I've read all 144 of them!

121
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,875
I'd be more disturbed
than proud of that fact

122
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,208
if I were you.

123
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,708
What'cha thinkin'
about, Kokonotsu?

124
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,083
[KOKONOTSU]
Um. Well...

125
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,541
...I was just thinking
about the boy in the story.

126
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,541
Do you think the old man is
supposed to be his grandfather?

127
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,958
Yeah, I guess.

128
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,250
That would explain why he
needed to visit the grave.

129
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,291
[KOKONOTSU] But why would he
make his own grandson sick?

130
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,041
Seems kinda harsh for
forgetting to visit a grave.

131
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,791
What's wrong? You guys
think it's harsh too, right?

132
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,791
Basically you don't
like the story

133
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,416
because it doesn't make sense.

134
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,625
If it doesn't follow any type
of logic, it's not scary to you.

135
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Right!

136
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
For example,

137
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,875
what about those horror
stories where everyone dies,

138
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,208
and yet, there's still
someone to tell it?

139
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,666
Details like that, am I right?

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Yes! My point exactly!

141
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,541
[HOTARU]
What about the one


142
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,166
where the two guys get
attacked by a monster,


143
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,000
and one leaves the
other boy behind?


144
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,000
[screams]

145
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,208
[HOTARU]
But then later, he's all,

146
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,833
"I wonder how my friend is?"
and like, calm?

147
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,250
What a horrible guy!

148
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,958
You don't just abandon
a buddy like that!

149
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,750
[HOTARU] Then, there's
another story about this girl


150
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,041
who gets sucked into
this strange darkness.


151
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,166
Darkness is the worst!

152
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,541
I mean, she's probably dead,

153
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,250
but somehow people still
know about her story.

154
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah, how do they know about it?

155
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,208
Right?

156
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,541
[HOTARU] And the one
where a girl's friend


157
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,666
falls into a manhole,
and there're bloodstains?

Bloodstains?

00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,166
Then she goes to school
like normal the next day.

160
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,500
The day before she was all,

00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,625
"Wah! My friend
fell into a hole!

162
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,958
These bloodstains are creepy!"

163
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,708
But now she's like,
"Where's he at?"

00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:50,250

00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,208
I understand your frustration.

Luckily, I can
explain those things.

167

You can?

168
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,375
Yep!

169
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,416
This is top secret, okay?

170
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,416
You have to swear that
you'll never share

171
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,125
what I'm about to tell you.

172
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,625
[BOTH]
Mh-hm.

173
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,333
All the stories are written
by the company's employees.

174
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,541
What? Seriously? Even though
they sound super realistic?

175

[HOTARU]
Indeed!

176
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
It's all just a bunch of
made up horror stories.

You're kidding!
That's messed up!

Me? What do I think?

180

I don't really care
one way or the other

181
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,375
about those fake stories.

182
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,000
Those super scary fake stories.

183
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,666
And this crazy
horrific packaging.

184
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,500
They don't bother
me in the least,

185
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,000

about it, okay?

I'm sorry. It's like my brain

It doesn't matter that
they're all made up.

191
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,666
To me, those stories
are still terrifying.

Worry not, Master!

00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,500
Huh?

195
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,083
As long as we have this gum
here with us, we'll be A-okay!

196
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,500
How's it work?

197
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,416
Do we like chew the gum to
take our mind off things?

198
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,541
[HOTARU]
Not at all.

199
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,791
So how does it help?

200
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,041
[HOTARU] Say a ghost or
monster does show up,

201
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,166
we'll just share some of
our yummy gum with them.

202
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,000
Then they'll be grateful and
go back to their homes!

203
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,625
Because sharing is caring.

204
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,916
So I'm told.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,291
Are you sure about that?

206
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,958
Of course. Don't you believe
in the power of sharing?

207
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,333
[SAYA] I mean, yeah,
sharing is awesome, but...

208
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,833
...it's more like I wasn't aware

209
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,041
that a ghost could
actually chew gum.

210
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,625
Uh. Although,

211
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,500
trying to imagine a ghost
chewing gum is kinda funny.

212
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,750
In fact, I don't
feel scared anymore!

213

[TO] Aw man, that's a
pretty fair argument.

Geez and they cost
13 hundred yen, too.

Why are they so expensive?

He could no longer ignore
his friend's steely resolve.

This was about more than
money, it was about pride.

Sometimes being a man means
standing by your word.

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,625
You hold the ball like this.

Then you swing the

00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,041
[TO]
Aww...

320
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,791
What? So <i>kendama</i> is
super popular now?

321
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,583
According to To.

322
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,458
It's weird. He bought
two of them from me,

323
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,625
and all just to prove that
they are indeed popular.

324
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,333
[SAYA]
Uh.

325

If I remember right,

00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,125
I think we already have a
few of them back at the house.

Really?

[SAYA]
Yeah, now that I think about it,

329
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,416
you said they were
popular back then, too.

330
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,541
You're getting
quite the collection.

Listen, Coconuts.

345
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,875
You ever stop to think about why
popular guys are even popular?

346
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,458
Not really.

347
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,166
[TO]
They're popular...

348
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,500
...because they understand the
inner workings of a girl's mind.

349
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,208
You know what I'm talking about.

350
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,166
Like those super average
guys walking around

351
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,083
with girls who are
way outta their league.

352
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,333
They're not good looking,
but they get how women work.

353
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,166
Amazing! How do you know that?

354
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,208
I sink a lotta time
into researching things

355
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,041
in order to stay ahead
of the popular trends.

356
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,166
I get it, like with <i>kendama!</i>

357
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,958
Exactly right!

358
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,208
What's more,

359
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,583
the other day while I
was flipping through

360
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,125
Saya's dumb fashion magazines,
I noticed something.

361
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,875
I learned girls are total
saps for fortune-telling!

362
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,833
For real?

363
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,416
See, it's like this.

364
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,041
Oh no, I can't believe
I'm late again!

Are you all right,

my hasty little
sunglasses butterfly?

368
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,583
[TO] For some strange reason,
girls seem to enjoy

369
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,291
surrendering themselves
to things like

370
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,041
"fate" or "coincidence".

371
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,208
So in order to better understand
our subjects, A.K.A. girls,

372
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,500
we should try it out.

Oh yeah, I've seen that before.

375
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,208
I know we carry it at the shop,

376
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,708
but I don't think
I've ever eaten it,

377
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,083
so I'm honestly not sure how
it's supposed to even taste.

Uh... Well, that
makes two of us.

379

There's only one way to find out
though, so let's give it a try.

380
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Okay!

381
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,791
I guess I'll just
pick one randomly.

Oh, let's start with health!
Can't go wrong there.

a double circle!

Aw yeah, that's
definitely a good thing!

Looks like my health is optimal!

Um, so how is it really?

Huh? How's what?
