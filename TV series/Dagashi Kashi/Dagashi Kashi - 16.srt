1
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,125
[SAYA]
And that's the plan!

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,958
Make sure to ask Hotaru
so we can all go together.

3
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,333
Let's meet up around five.

4
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,750
For fireworks.

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,500
[SAYA] Hello? Did you
get all that, Coconuts?

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,541
Uh, sorry. Yeah, I'm listening.

7
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,833
[SAYA] Doesn't sound like it.
Anyway, we'll see you at five.

8
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,166
Don't forget to
call Hotaru, okay?

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep, I've got it.

10
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,458
Then again, knowing
Hotaru, she'll...

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,458
...probably... stop... by...

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,708
So yeah. I'll just tell her.

13
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,500
[SAYA]
Is she there?

14
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,791
Uh-huh. I should go.

15
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,791
Hey. Can I help you
with anything, Hotaru?

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,458
Shh...!

17
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,625
I'm trying to concentrate.

18
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,833
[KOKONOTSU whispering]
Right. Sorry.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,875
[HOTARU]
Hm...

20
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,666
[HOTARU]
Ha!

21
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,875
I'll take this one, please!

22
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,583
Uh, sure?

23
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,958
[HOTARU]
The Homerun Bar.

24
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,416
It's so much more than
just another delicious

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,291
ice cream treat.
It's a snack innovation.

26
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,208
The roots of it are traced back
to Japan's first ice cream bar.

27
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,208
Here's another fun fact.

28
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,583
It was the first ice cream that
let you win a free snack.

29
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,500
You see, some of the bars have
homeruns or hits carved

30
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,875
into the popsicle stick.

31
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,250
Aside from the free bar
you can still win today,

32
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,750
there used to be other neat
prizes you could win.

33
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,625
Of course, these days
it's limited to ice cream.

34
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,166
[KOKONOTSU]
That's pretty cool.

35
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,416
Ah-hah, you wanted
free ice cream,

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,875
that's why you were
so serious, huh?

37
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,375
[HOTARU gasps]

38
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,666
I am always serious when
it comes to <i>dagashi</i> !

39
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,791
[KOKONOTSU]
Well. I guess that's true.

40
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:22,208
[HOTARU] Hm... Though I
suppose that maybe...

41
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:27,625
...I was being exceptionally
serious, this time.

42
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,041
Okay, but why?

43
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,541
[gasps]

44
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,583
[KOKONOTSU gulps]

45
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,875
[KOKONOTSU gasps]
Uh, anyway, I hope you win!

46
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,166
[HOTARU]
Hm? You do?

47
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,000
But wouldn't it be better for
your shop if I didn't win?

48
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,000
You'd have to just give me one.

49
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,958
I appreciate your concern,

50
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,333
but honestly the number of
winners is already decided

51
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,708
by the manufacturer.

52
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,083
So in that regard we're not
actually losing anything

53
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,000
if you get a winning bar.

54
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,125
[gasps]
That's very true.

55
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,666
You really are
brilliant at this.

56
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,833
[popping]

57
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm? Ah! Aw man!

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,333
Something wrong?

59
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,916
Uh, I just realized that the
bus is gonna leave soon!

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,166
Really? Do you have
to be somewhere?

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,458
Sorry to keep you.

62
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,416
Nah, it's not like that,
and I meant to tell you,

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,041
see, there's a fireworks
festival at the beach.

64
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:34,625
And I... was gonna ask
if you wanted to go!

65
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,208
[HOTARU gasps]

66
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,791
Just us two?

67
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,958
[gasps]

68
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,291
[KOKONOTSU shouts]

69
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,791
This sucks.
That was the last bus!

70
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,958
So now... what?

71
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
[pants]

72
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,916
[HOTARU]
Just us two?

73
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,208
[HOTARU]
Kokonotsu... Kokonotsu!

74
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,125
Hurry! You're slowing down!

75
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,958
[KOKONOTSU pants]
Right!

76
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,250
Come on, we're gonna
miss the fireworks!

77
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,916
[KOKONOTSU shouts]

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,708
[HOTARU]
You can do it, Kokonotsu!

79
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:38,000
[phone rings]

80
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,416
[SAYA]
Is he not answering?

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,666
[TO]
Mm-hm.

82
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,166
I wonder if something happened.

83
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,458
[TO] Mm. Nah, I'm sure
they're both okay.

84
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,458
But thanks to this crowd,
it might be tough for us

85
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,666
to try and meet up.

86
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,166
[SAYA]
Mm...

87
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,041
Well. Those buses
can get pretty loud,

88
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,625
so maybe he couldn't
hear his phone.

89
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm sure it'll work out.

90
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:15,541
[KOKONOTSU grunts]

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,958
Man, I don't know if
this is gonna work out!

92
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,791
Kokonotsu, you okay?

93
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,375
[KOKONOTSU grunts] I may or may
not be having a heart attack!

94
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Also...

95
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,166
Just us two?

96
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,083
[KOKONOTSU]
Actually no, there's more.

97
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,833
We're supposed to meet
up with To and Saya

98
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,708
and go see them as a group.

99
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,458
[KOKONOTSU] Saya thought we
should invite you to come, too.

100
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,291
Yeah.

101
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,500
[pants]

102
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Why did I lie to her?

103
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,041
[HOTARU grunts]

104
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,375
[gasps]

105
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,833
[HOTARU grunts]

106
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,208
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

107
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,916
[HOTARU]
Hey... Let's take a break.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,750
Okay.

109
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,791
[KOKONOTSU]
I guess I'm kind of relieved.

110
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,333
This is my chance to come clean.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,041
Listen, about earlier today.

112
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,375
[HOTARU]
I'm sorry...

113
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,708
...for complicating things.

114
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Um. You didn't.

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,666
[HOTARU] I just...
wanted to talk to you alone.

116
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,750
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

117
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,833
[HOTARU]
For the first time in a while,

118
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,166
I feel like I'm able to
look at things differently.

119
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,041
It's all thanks to you,
and Saya and Endo as well.

120
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,958
Every day is an adventure.

121
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,791
I've never had such a
fun summer break before.

122
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:04,666
Yeah, it's been great, really.
For me, anyway.

123
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,083
The way things are now
seems to have little to do

124
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,708
with my original mission.

125
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,291
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

126
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,541
Which is why I wanted to
talk to you in private.

127
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,166
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh...

128
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Hota--

129
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,500
[BOTH gasp]

130
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,041
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh yeah.

131
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,916
They're shooting the
fireworks off over the ocean.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,333
So we have a front row seat.

133
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,791
Awesome!

134
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
[KOKONOTSU]
The show's already started.

135
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,875
Guess I'll apologize
to Saya and To later.

136
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,083
[HOTARU]
Kokonotsu.

137
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

138
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,958
[HOTARU]
Look.

139
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh? What is it?

140
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,958
Hm? No way! A winner?

141
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,583
This is the Homerun Bar
you were eating, right?

142
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,500
Uh, and you won? Like for real?

143
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,541
But you never win
no matter what you--

144
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,000
[yelps]

145
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,583
This may be surprising,

146
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,250
but I'm actually a
very forgetful person.

147
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:14,958
Which is why... I'd like
to you to keep this.

148
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,333
So I won't lose it.

149
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,500
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

150
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,625
[HOTARU] And by letting
you hold onto it,

151
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,166
the next time I find myself
craving a Homerun Bar,

152
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,041
I'll be all like,
"Pay up, sucka!"

153
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,500
And then I'll get an
ice cream for free.

154
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,208
[KOKONOTSU] I thought
she was gonna kiss me!

155
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,291
I thought she was gonna kiss me!
I thought she was gonna kiss me.

156
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,875
I thought she was
gonna kiss me...!

157
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,291
[HOTARU]
By the way.

158
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,125
Could you tell Master Saya
and Endo something?

159
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,958
Tell them I'm sorry I kept
you to myself tonight, okay?

160
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,375
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh... Sure.

161
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,416
I should get going.

162
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,458
[HOTARU]
Goodbye.

163
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,041
[KOKONOTSU]
It rained the next day.

164
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,833
So when she didn't show up,
I thought that was why.

165
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,583
[KOKONOTSU]
No one likes to get rained on.

166
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,083
[KOKONOTSU] Then it
rained again the next day,

167
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,458
so I thought that was why again.

169
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,375
Whew, it is really
pouring out there!

170
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,250
Hey Saya, what's up?

171
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh, uh. I'll get you a towel.

172
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,750
[SAYA]
Thanks!

173
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,708
[KOKONOTSU] After that,
it was sunny for a while.

174
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:56,291
[KOKONOTSU pants]

175
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:09,833
--[bell rings]
--[SAYA] Hm? Hey, Coconuts!

176
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,208
Want some coffee? Iced or hot?

177
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,875
[SAYA]
Coconuts?

178
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh? Uh... Iced.

179
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,916
[SAYA]
Okay!

180
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Thanks for the coffee.

181
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,500
Uh! You're leaving already?

182
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,125
[KOKONOTSU] Yeah, gotta get
back to the shop.

183
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,625
By the way. I haven't
see Hotaru around.

184
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,708
[SAYA] Is she out of
town or something?

185
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
I'm not sure.

186
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Summer is almost over.

187
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,291
[KOKONOTSU]
And...

188
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,041
...winter is coming.
