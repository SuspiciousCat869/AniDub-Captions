So it would seem.

Poor thing.

You look miserable.

Yeah, It hurts a lot.

Fortunately...

21
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,458
...I think I at least know
what's causing the ulcer.

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,875
[SAYA]
It's sorta obvious.

23
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,541
I blame myself!

24
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,958
I've been staying up late
thinking about <i>dagashi,</i>

25
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,500
and now I have this ulcer!

26

[SAYA]
That's not why.

27
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,750
[HOTARU]
Uh?

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,208
Then what's causing it?

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
[gasps]

30
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,583
Maybe it's the stress of
not being able to eat <i>dagashi</i>

31
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,458
more than three times a day?

32
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,625
Well, um, I'm not a
doctor or anything,

33
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,791
but I really don't think
either of those reasons

34
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,541
could cause you to
get a mouth ulcer.

35
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,708
But there is a more
obvious explanation.

36
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,916
Super obvious.

37
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,083
Wait. Are you saying it's
because I eat too much <i>dagashi?</i>

38
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,875
Is that what you're insinuating?

39
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,750
That's a bingo!

40
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,041
No way! I reckon that's wrong!

41
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,916
[SAYA] What? Are you
serious right now, Hotaru?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,166
Another thing, what did I
just hear? An accent? Huh?

No, don't eat that!

46
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,416
This is the absolute
worst thing you could eat

47

with a mouth ulcer!

48
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,875
Candy's not my thing,

49
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,833
but even I know this stuff
crackles and pops in your mouth.

50
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,625
You're right on target, Master!

51
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,125
As you may already know,
this snack is called <i>watapachi.</i>

52
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,458
This sneaky snack
disguises itself

53
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,958
as a sweet, innocent,
cotton candy puffball.

54
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,208
In reality though,
it's actually harboring

55
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,125
tiny ninja-like crackles
that pop in your mouth.

56

Talk about a shock!

57
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,125
Exactly!

58
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,583
So if you eat <i>watapachi</i>
while you have a mouth ulcer,

59
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,000
it's gonna hurt like hell!
It's a bad idea!

60
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,500
Probably. Even still, I want it.

61
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,500
[HOTARU]
The fact that I shouldn't eat it

62
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,625
is what makes this
snack so irresistible.

63
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,458
Like a forbidden fruit!

bottom like super sour?

Indeed!

there are left over crackles

cotton candy part!

00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,166
Well, yeah, actually,

163
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,041
maybe it's because
I'm not as big a fan

164
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,666
when it comes to
<i>dagashi,</i> but um...

165
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,833
...perhaps you should try
to be a little more mature

166
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,708
and, you know, lead by example.

167
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,958
I understand,
and I agree 100%.

168
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,375
Uh. Awesome! So you
get what I'm saying?

169
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,125
[HOTARU]
Yes.

170
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,041
That's such a relief.

171
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,666
Let me try again, okay?

172
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,666
Miss Saya, I would
be ever so grateful

173
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,791
if you were to join me for...

174
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,416
...a delightful
<i>dagashi</i> tea party!

175
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
[giggles]

176
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,416
[HOTARU] It is a rather
pleasant and sunny afternoon.

177
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,750
My good friend and I are
spending the day together.

178
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,333
These moments never
feel long enough.

179
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,000
While we often have
different preferences

180
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,208
when it comes to tea,

181
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,791
our tastes in sweets
are shockingly similar,

182
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,333
and we often choose
the same snack.

183
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,583
We might not always
agree with each other,

184
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,750
but when it comes to delicacies,
we're of the same mind.

185
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Today my friend has made
a brilliant decision.

186
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,416
"Lucky Poo."

187
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,875
Yes, let us eat delectable poo.

188
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,083
[HOTARU laughing]

189
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,458
[SAYA]
You may be acting all classy,

190
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,625
but you're still saying poo!

191
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,750
[SAYA sighs]

192
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,166
Oh, well.

193
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,625
Shall we continue with whatever
it is we're doing here?

194
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,875
A poo party?

195
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,000
[SAYA]
A what now?!

196
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,125
[SAYA]
Who in their right mind

197
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,833
would wanna go to
that kind of party?

198
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,958
It doesn't sound remotely fun!

199
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,541
Hotaru, you may
not realize this,

200
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,125
but a poo party
sounds really gross.

201
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,208
It does? I wonder why?

202
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,958
[SAYA] The way the candy
comes out of the end

203
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,458
makes it even more disgusting.

204
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,666
[HOTARU] Here, Master.
Hold out your hand.

205
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,333
[whimpers]

206
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,750
What's this? Hm?

207
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,000
Poor thing's all stopped up.
Might have to unclog it.

208
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,916
Come out!

209
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,750
All right! Looks like we've
cleared the poo passage.

210
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,083
Okie dokie, Master, bon appétit!

211
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,375
Enjoy!

212
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,833
[SAYA]
Hm?

213
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,125
What is your opinion?
Do you approve?

214
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,416
It's crazy, but I
actually like it!

215
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Wonderful!

216
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
[SAYA]
The candy tastes like chocolate,

217
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,083
but also kind of
like grapes too,

218
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,041
so it's sort of refreshing!

219
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,125
And it's really good!

220
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,708
A simple <i>dagashi</i> is allowed
to shine for a single moment,

221
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,875
but then opens up a new path
for an unknowing traveler.

222
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,750
To think that we might not
have achieved such a milestone

223
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:46,125
if it weren't for poo!
Yes, our beloved poo!

224
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,625
Aw, man!

225
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,958
[giggles]

226
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,875
Because it's just us girls,
I want to be honest.

227
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,208
It may sound silly, but I've
wanted to ask you something.

228
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,958
Yeah, what?

229
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,833
Okay, well.

230
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,208
[HOTARU]
See the back?

231
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,625
It's about the things
that come out.

232
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,500
Don't they remind you of
something in particular?

233
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,333
Uh. What? I thought we
already knew what it was!

234
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,708
I mean, it's basically sh--

235
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,708
No! Don't say it! Kids
could be watching right now!

236
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,583
Shaped like an egg?

237
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,958
Huh?

238
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,541
[SAYA]
Egg-shaped? Seriously?

239
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,833
But it's called Lucky Poo!

240
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey, I'm back.

241
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,875
Oh.

242
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,375
Hotaru! I didn't
know you were here.

243
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,291
Heya, Kokonotsu!
I'm glad you're back!

244
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,916
You were gone a while.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,208
Oh yeah, you just
missed Master Saya.

246
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,375
She didn't tell me
she was coming by.

247
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,416
Uh?

248
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Is that rice?

249
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,833
Why on earth is she
holding a bowl of rice?

250
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,916
[HOTARU]
Anywho...

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,416
I was thinking.

252
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,666
There's something I really think
you should know about me.

253
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,666
Uh. Fine, go ahead.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,583
Don't laugh, okay?

255
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,916
I won't.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,916
You see, I was actually
born and raised in Osaka!

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,375
No way. How shocking.
It can't be true.

258
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,750
Hold on, why are you bringing
that up out of nowhere?

259
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,791
Huh?

260
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Now she's eating.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,125
Just randomly eating
rice in our store.

262
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,875
Weirdo.

263
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,083
[HOTARU]
Normally...

264
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,208
...I talk with a Kansai accent.

265
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,250
You don't notice
because I hide it.

266
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Okay.

267
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,666
But I am from Osaka,

268
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,750
so sometimes there's
nothing I can do about it,

269
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,000
you know what I mean?

270
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,250
Not really.

271
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,041
[HOTARU]
Hmm... Ah!

272
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,000
Like, for example. Let's take
<i>Umaibok.</i> It's a <i>dagashi,</i> right?

273
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Right.

274
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,875
[HOTARU] Then you've got
Morocco Fruit Yogul,

275
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,041
yet another kind of <i>dagashi.</i>

276
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Also true.

277
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,625
[HOTARU]
And even <i>kinako-bou.</i>

278
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,208
There's no doubt that
it's another great snack.

279
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,583
Sure.

280
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,208
Then there's this!

281
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,083
Miyama's Sakura Daikon!

282
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, you may not
believe it, but...

283
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,250
...this is one of very
the best <i>dagashi!</i>

284
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,708
This here thing be
a pickled daikon!

285
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:14,208
Fer real! Seein' as I'm from
Osaka, I just had to tell ya!

286
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,583
--Know what I mean?
--[KOKONOTSU] Okay.

287
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,833
--Know what I mean?
--thanks for letting me know?

288
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,083
I bet you didn't know this,

289
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,583
but there's a stereotype
about Kansai people that says

290
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,416
they often get surprised to
see pickles in snack shops

291
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,625
when they visit a big city.

292
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,958
[KOKONOTSU]
What? That's a real stereotype?

293
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,958
[HOTARU]
Yep!

294
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,500
So let me guess.

295
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,125
Sakura Daikon's not something
that you can find in Kansai?

296
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,916
Correct! In fact,
go even further!

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,291
It's actually very difficult
to find this snack

298
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,583
anywhere west of that area!

299
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,125
Wow, I learned somethin' new.

300
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,041
And a lot of <i>dagashi</i> are only
available to specific regions.

301
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,875
I really dropped some
knowledge on you today,

302
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,250
didn't I, Kokonotsu?

303
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,583
Yeah.

304
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,375
So, now you have a little
background information.

305
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,458
As an official
representative of Osaka,

306
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,916
I'll put this Sakura
Daikon to the test!

307
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,375
Let's see how the taste
compares, shall we?

308
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,500
[HOTARU]
The color is spot on!

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,791
Wow! And the snack's texture
is absolutely perfect!

310
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,166
As expected from
domestic daikon,

311
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,291
the flavor hints of
sweetened vinegar

312
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,208
that tastes a little
sweet and a little sour.

313
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,416
I do declare this to be
the best pickled daikon!

314
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,458
Yep! Seein' as I'm from Osaka,

315
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,541
I just can't help
pointin' that out to ya.

316
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,083
[KOKONOTSU] Well, you've
pointed it out twice now.

317
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,125
Hey, sometimes the
truth bears repeating,

318
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,125
know what I mean?

319
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,875
[chuckles nervously]

320
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,916
Anyway on a somewhat
related note...

321
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,291
...I feel like Sakura
Daikon tastes best

322
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,500
if you combine it
with a bowl of rice.

323
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,916
[HOTARU]
I mean the pickle fits nicely

324
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,125
into the rice bowl
and everything!

325
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,875
[HOTARU] The two compliment
each other so well!

326
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:10,416
Oh. I could go for a big bowl
of rice right about now.

327
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,541
[KOKONOTSU]
What?

328
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,791
[HOTARU]
Uh?

329
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,583
Well, I'll be. I done got
some rice already!

330
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,500
Holy crap, she's acting
super strange today!

331
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,000
Whoopsie!

332
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,166
I can't believe I slipped
into my native dialect again.

333
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,083
[HOTARU]
And so...

334
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,166
[HOTARU] You may be wondering
what point I'm trying to make

335
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,833
using the Sakura
Daikon as an example.

336
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,791
The thing is, you don't usually
combine <i>dagashi</i> with meals.

337
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,041
But, like with many things,
there are some exceptions.

338
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,791
Certain snacks do exist that
go quite nicely with a meal.

339
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,041
I'm telling you,
when it comes to <i>dagashi,</i>

340
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,791
there's always something
new and surprising.

341
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,125
Also, there are quite
a few combinations

342
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,958
in the <i>"Dagashi</i> that goes
well with rice" series.

343
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,750
Maybe some other time, though.

344
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,166
Meaning this discussion
isn't over...

345
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,000
[HOTARU]
There is one more thing.

346
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
To be completely honest.

348
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,666
As it turns out, I'm
not actually from Osaka.

349
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,791
See ya later, alligator!

350
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
That was weirder than usual.

351
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,333
[KOKONOTSU] I can't
believe she used my bowl.

352
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,708
Wow, I swear.

353
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,458
Anyway, guess I'll
go eat some lunch.

354
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,666
[KOKONOTSU]
She ate all our rice?

355
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,833
[door opens]

356
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Welcome!

357
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,208
Howdy, y'all! How's business?

358
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,125
[screams]

359
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,875
What in tarnation?

360
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,416
[HOTARU]
And so...

361
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,875
[KOKONOTSU]
I wonder.

362
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,958
It looks like Hotaru might
be upset about something.

363
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,875
Hey, um, you okay?

364
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,083
[HOTARU]
Huh?

365
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,916
Oh, Kokonotsu. How long
have you been there?

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,875
Come on, for real?

367
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,500
You're the one who just
walked back into the store.

368
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,708
Never mind, it doesn't really
matter at the moment.

369
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,541
You look kinda down though.
Is something bothering you?

370
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,000
You wanna talk about it?

371
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,125
I guess.

372
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,250
I mean, do you maybe think

373
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,458
I could ask your advice
about something?

374
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,291
Absolutely. Ask away.
I'll help however I can.

375
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,458
[HOTARU]
Just be honest.

376
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,583
'Kay!

377
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,708
Here goes.

378
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:42,750
How do you feel about boobs?

379
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Seriously?

380
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,500
This has to be a trick question!

381
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,750
No way is she for real!

382
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,500
When she says "boobs,"
does she mean like boob boobs?

383
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,916
Should I answer honestly?

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,500
But... why does
this feel like trap?

385
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,833
If I tell her the truth

386
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,708
about how I think sweater
stretchers are awesome,

387
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,250
she'll probably be
totally disgusted

388
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,750
and never speak to me again!

389
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,666
What I say today could
possibly affect my entire life!

390
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,000
Pull yourself together, man!

391
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,875
You've got this,
just be cool, dude.

392
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,291
[clears throat]

393
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,083
Well now, you know
I'm not like most boys.

394
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,083
Honestly, I think guys who
are obsessed with boobs

395
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,583
come off as a bit childish.

396
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,875
I mean, geez! There's more
to life than boobs, you know?

397
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,083
Just my opinion!

398
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,666
I see.

399
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,291
I'm very disappointed
in you, Kokonotsu.

400
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,166
Wait, come back! Sorry I
uttered such falsehoods!

401
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,250
The truth is--

402
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,583
[HOTARU]
Huh?

403
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,416
The truth is, I think
about boobs all the time!

404
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,500
Hey, this is... Egg Ice Cream?

405
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,750
[HOTARU]
Atta boy, champ.

406
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,916
I knew I could count
on you in the end.

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,291
I'm so glad you
told me the truth.

408
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,000
The second theme for
today is Egg Ice Cream.

409
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,333
Commonly known as
Boob Ice Cream!

410
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,000
Honk-a. Honk-a.

411
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,791
Boob Ice cream?
Hold on, Boob Ice Cream?

412
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,208
[HOTARU]
That's the one!

413
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,625
I've really been looking
forward to eating this snack.

414
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,875
But I was wondering,

415
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,625
do you think that you
could eat some first?

416
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh...

417
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,583
Sure, if you really want me to.

418
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,583
Nicely done!

419
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
Some people just cut the end,

420
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,416
while others rip into
it with their teeth!

421
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,208
It's ultimately up
to the snacker

422
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,833
and whatever they prefer.

423
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,375
It exploded. As I thought.

424
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,166
Wha--?

425
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,500
I held the boob in my hand

426
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,250
for a long time to warm it up,

427
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,791
which was all part
of my master plan!

428
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,166
Why would you even think
to do something so mean?

429
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,833
It's simple.
I wanted to melt it.

430
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,208
Boob Ice Cream is
easier to eat that way.

431
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,083
But if you end up
melting it too much,

432
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,625
then it explodes everywhere!

433
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,083
Hence why I had you go first!

434
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,958
Geez, thanks a lot.

435
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,250
But what's with that name?

436
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,416
I've never heard anyone
call it a boob before.

437
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,416
[HOTARU]
What?

438
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,458
Are you sure?

439
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,500
How strange.
I'm certain it's a boob.

440
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,000
[KOKONOTSU]
No, no, no.

441
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,375
I think what you're meaning
to say is Bomb Ice Cream.

442
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,791
Notice how the end of the snack
is shaped like a bomb fuse,

443
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,125
add in the explosion
and it makes sense!

444
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,708
That's so ridiculous!

445
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,916
There's no way you could
eat a bomb, silly!

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,833
You can't eat boobs either!

447
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,416
[HOTARU]
Listen, Kokonotsu.

448
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,666
Okay?

449
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,958
It's about boobs.

450
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,166
Okay...?

451
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,708
Boobs are definitely
not something you eat.

452
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,916
You suck them!

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,666
[gasping]

454
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,875
How's that ice cream, Coconuts?

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,583
You look so cute,
like a widdle baby!

456
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,708
Just shut it!

457
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,375
We've been calling it
Bomb Ice Cream forever!

458
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,666
Not to mention... it's kinda
weird... to say boob, y'know?

459
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,083
[HOTARU]
No, it's not!

460
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,208
It's just another stupid word!
Boobity boob ba boob!

461
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,375
Boobity boob... ba boob?

462
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,291
[HOTARU]
See? Easy!

463
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,666
Well, it still doesn't matter!

464
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,541
I've called it Bomb Ice
Cream since I was a kid.

465
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,083
That's how I've always known it!

466
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,625
Well good for you,

467
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,000
but I've always called it Boob
Ice Cream since I was a kid!

468
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,250
I'm certainly not
gonna change that now!

469
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,666
Me either!

470
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,500
Look, we're never going
to get anywhere like this.

471
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,041
Yeah, I agree.

472
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,333
Idea time!

473
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,708
I'll have to eat the ice cream

474
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,416
and then decide on
its proper name!

475
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

476
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,083
[KOKONOTSU] I'm not sure
I'd call that a solution,

477
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,416
but whatever.

478
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,666
[chuckles nervously]

479
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:37,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Wait a sec!

480
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,083
Look out!

481
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,791
Aw, man. I tried to warn you.

482
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,750
You've been holding the ice
cream this whole time,

483
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,750
so of course it would
explode like mine did.

484
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,208
Et tu, Boob-eh?

485
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,500
You were right after all.
It's explosive.

486
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,291
[gasps]

487
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,625
I hate to admit it, but
it does seem bomb-like.

488
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,708
So the name fits after all.

489
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,833
I think both
answers are right.

490
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

491
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Hotaru.

492
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,833
Boob Ice Cream suddenly
seems appropriate.

493
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,291
So very appropriate...

494
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,000
[HOTARU]
Don't you think the <i>watapachi</i>

495
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,250
and Sakura Daikon
were super exciting?

496
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,333
[SAYA]
For your ulcer.

497
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,666
[HOTARU]
Right?

498
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,833
[SAYA]
I get how <i>watapachi</i> is exciting,

499
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,916
but why would you
think Sakura Daikon is?

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,958
[chuckles]

501
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,583
[HOTARU]
Excellent question, Master!

502
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,875
Sakura Daikon is made
with sweetened vinegar.

503
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,916
And vinegar and salt have
something in common!

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,791
[gasps]

505
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,291
[SAYA]
Wait.

506
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,166
[HOTARU] Both of them sting
like crazy on an open wound!

507
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,333
[screams]

508
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,708
[HOTARU] Just wait
until the next episode.

509
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,250
It's "that kind of story!"

510
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,458
[SAYA] What? I don't even
know what that means!

511
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,958
[HOTARU]
Until next time, snack warriors!
