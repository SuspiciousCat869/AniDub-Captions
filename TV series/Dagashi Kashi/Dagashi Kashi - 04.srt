Have you ever heard about
blind wine tasting before?

You have to guess what

No, not wine tasting.

...a <i>fugashi</i> taste test!

<i>Fugashi?</i>

30
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,750
[HOTARU] You heard right.
It's a traditional <i>dagashi</i>

31
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,291
that almost everyone has eaten
as least once in their life.

32
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,958
Fugashi is made from a
wheat gluten called " <i>fu</i> "

33
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,166
and brown sugar.

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,041
A lot of women prefer
it over other snacks

35
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,500
since it has health benefits.

36
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,666
Because of that you see
it in a ton of stores.

37
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,125
Everyone is jumping on board
the healthy train these days

38
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,833
and people love it. For reals.

There are many kinds of <i>fugashi</i>

Jeez, that's a lot of snacks.

[HOTARU]
We're going to try them all!

51
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,500
The rules are simple! You have
to determine what you're eating

00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,875
using only your mouth!

Well, what are you waiting for?

Yes! Sorry!

In order to judge
it solely by taste,

we can't be allowed
to use our hands!

[KOKONOTSU] I mean,

It's just baked <i>fu</i>
coated in brown sugar.

88
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,666
Can she really tell what it is
without seeing or touching it?

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,958

this is a popular <i>fugashi.</i>

Was I right? Was I, was I?

97
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,833
Fuu-chan are often
sold in value packs,

98
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,208
so the chances of getting an
edge piece are pretty good

them, and they're delicious!

Yeah, you were right!

101
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,708
[KOKONOTSU] She could tell
it was from a value pack

102
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,500
just because it
was an edge piece?

Okay, Kokonotsu!
Now it's your turn!

I've got it.

138

Most of the snacks

are in either large
bags or value packs.

When you take the food out
of a big bag like that,

141

it makes a specific sound.

it was more like an individual
package being opened.

What's more, there is
only one snack present

00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,958
and yet it's still small
enough to eat easily.

163
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,708
This is Yaokin's <i>Fugashi.</i>

164
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,583
You'll have to do
better than that!

165
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,208
[BOTH grunt]

166
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,375
A smooth texture and
a subtle sweetness.

167
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,083
Those two qualities
mixed together

168
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,791
can only mean one thing.

169
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,625
Without a doubt I can tell you.

170
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,916
This is Fuu-chan with honey!

171
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,208
[HOTARU] Impressive, you managed
to guess them all so far.

172
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,791
Yeah, you're pretty
amazing, yourself.

173
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,166
Thanks but it's
still not over yet.

174
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,125
[gasps]

175
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,458
[KOKONOTSU] Oh... There aren't
a lot left to choose from.

176
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,541
It doesn't matter
which one I pick.

177
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,875
Hotaru could answer correctly

178
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,083
just through a process
of elimination.

179
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,750
[grunts]
Crap, what should I do?

180
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,958
[gasps]

181
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,375
Excuse me for a sec,
I'll be right back.

182
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,291
[clattering]

183
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,125
[KOKONOTSU]
And I'm back.

184
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,375
[plastic crinkles]

185
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,083
[HOTARU] It sounds like
he opened something

186
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,208
in a single package, but that
doesn't make sense because

187
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,291
I didn't see anything like
that left on the table.

188
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,333
[KOKONOTSU]
'Kay, get ready.

189
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,833
Aah!

190
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,833
[grunts]

191
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,541
[HOTARU grunting]
What? It's huge!

192
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,500
Stop forcing it in!

193
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,375
Well, Hotaru?

194
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,916
Bet you can't guess it!

195
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,000
[gasps]

196
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,791
[HOTARU]
This <i>fugashi</i> is way different

197
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,750
than anything else
I've tried today.

198
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,916
It's taste is indulgently sweet.

199
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,083
[gasps]

200
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,125
There isn't brown sugar in it.

201
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,416
This taste can
only be real sugar!

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,625
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

203
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,541
--[HOTARU] Kokonotsu!
--[KOKONOTSU gasps]

204
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,375
Give me another bite!

205
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,541
[gasps]

206
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,083
No doubt. It's regular sugar.

207
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,416
Typically <i>fugashi</i> is
made with brown sugar,

208
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,041
but I have heard of them being
made with real sugar too.

209
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,375
What's more--

210
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,750
There are different types of
<i>Fugashi</i> made all over Japan

211
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,708
and some are unique
to certain areas.

212
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,041
Based on its taste and size,
this is one of them!

213
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,458
I never dreamed I would
encounter it in this place.

214
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,375
Huh?

215
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
The answer, is <i>Sakura bou.</i>

216
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,541
[gasps]

217
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,291
[grunts]

218
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,416
That's correct. Man!

219
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,083
Whoa! I really am good at this!

220
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,291
But, wait a second.

221
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,125
I thought this was only
available in the Shizuoka area.

222
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,916
Well, my dad really
loves the stuff,

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
so he special orders it.

224
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,083
[HOTARU] There's strawberry,
melon, grape, and even banana!

225
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,125
Kinda funny that they
named them all <i>Sakura bou,</i>

226
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,583
even though they're
not the same color.

227
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,958
As long as it's yummy,
who cares?

228
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,250
[HOTARU giggles]

229
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,041
"A" for effort,
but we're still tied.

230
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,458
Well, don't get too cocky,
because I plan on winning.

231
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,625
Time to finish this
once and for all!

232
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,291
Agreed, let's do it!

233
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,041
Oh wait, before we start,
I'm kinda thirsty.

234
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,833
Yeah, I'm kinda thirsty too,
also I've been wondering,

235
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,041
are we going to eat all
the <i>fugashi</i> we opened?

236
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,416
[HOTARU]
Of course!

237
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,708
Once the bag is opened,
there's no way to reseal it.

238
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,375
The rules say we have to eat all
of them so they don't go bad.

239
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
What? That's not a thing.

240
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,250
Wha-- How about this?

241
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,708
What if I go buy us
a couple of drinks?

242
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,750
[gasps]

243
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,375
[KOKONOTSU]
Wait, you can't leave!

244
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,500
[HOTARU] Be right back, I think
milk would really hit the spot!

245
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Come back and untie me first!

246
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,375
Okay. She really left
me here like this.

247
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm...

248
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:41,833

Thank God, if my dad
saw me like this...

[KOKONOTSU chuckles]

252
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,791
I am your dad.

Oh, no. Dad! It's you!

254
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,791
Crap! Um, it's not
what it looks like!

255
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,458
[grunting]

256
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,041
[YO] So this is what you two
do when I'm not watching?

257
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,291
What?! No way!

258
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,458
[laughs] Well, I have
to go walk the dog now.

259
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,666
[KOKONOTSU]
We don't have a dog!

260
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,750
Uh, it's a metaphorical dog,
so yeah, bye.

261
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,541

Get back here, Yo!

--Come back!
--[YO screams]

263
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,458
[TO] So anyway,
what do you think, man?

264
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm? What do I think about what?

265
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,125
Jeez, I might as well
be talking to the wall.

266
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,833
I was saying that we
should plan another trip

267
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,000
to the pool with Hotaru.

268
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,750
I think it'd be fun,
among other things.

269
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,333
Yeah, well you know
what's not fun?

270
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,333
Running into Captain Speedo
the Lifeguard again.

271
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,000
[TO groans]
Yeah.

272
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,208
Oh! You're drawing them.

273
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,791
Wha--

274
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,208
[TO]
This one is totally Hotaru.

275
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,541
And this one is Saya.

276
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,291
[KOKONOTSU] Oh! I wasn't
really trying to draw them

277
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,666
in particular, but yeah,

278
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,083
I guess I can see
the resemblance.

279
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,958
[TO] You know what
I think, Coconuts?

280
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,583
It's just my opinion,
but it's missing something.

281
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,833
You messed up the most
important part of the picture.

282
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you talking about?

283
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,833
Uh-huh. This part right here!

284
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,750
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh? For real? You perv.

285
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

286
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,750
We meet again,
fellow snack warrior!

287
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,375
[KOKONOTSU] Oh, I didn't
know you were waiting.

288
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,333
Sorry about that.

289
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,375
I was hanging out at To's place.

290
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,250
[gasps]

291
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,666
[HOTARU]
Hm? Hey, what's the matter?

292
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,666
Uh... I just realized I left
something at the café.

293
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,000
[HOTARU]
Oh really?

294
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Was it important?

295
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,666
You know, I think Master Saya
said she's coming over later,

296
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,625
maybe you could ask
her to bring it to you.

297
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,875
Yeah. I guess.

298
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,791
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

299
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,083
[KOKONOTSU]
On the other hand,

300
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,583
if Saya sees what
To drew in my book.

301
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,708
There's no doubt.

302
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,750
She's going to murder me.

303
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,250
[HOTARU]
I understand.

304
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,875
Judging by the look on your
face, time is of the essence

305
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,083
in retrieving this item,
so I'll help you.

306
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,541
Help me do what?

307
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,083
Huh?

308
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,500
Wait, why are you in a
starting crouch position?

309
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,166
Is that what I think it is?

310
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,416
Yes, they're caramels by Glico.

311
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,291
I'm sure you've already heard
about this snack,

312
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,291
almost everyone in
Japan knows what it is

313
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,583
because of its slogan.

314
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,875
According to the box,

315
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,375
"One caramel equals 300 meters".

316
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,500
Each caramel is
sixteen calories,

317
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,625
which should generate
enough energy for a person

318
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,458

Did you know the company

326
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,083
was founded in 1921,

327
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,250
the same year the
caramel was born?

328
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh!

Café Endo is roughly
1,500 meters away.

332
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,958
One caramel will
take you 300 meters.

333
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,541
Okay, and?

334
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,000
You'll be able to run exactly
1,500 meters with five caramels!

335
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,875
[KOKONOTSU]

and then she washes them.

344
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,041
Which means, she wouldn't even
have to go near the table.

345
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,708
If I hurry, I'll get to the

[gasps]
Crap, I forgot!

347
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,000
She will have to go
over to the table,

348
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,000
because it needs
to be wiped down!

349
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,166
Oh man this is so bad!

350
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,291
How many more seconds will it
take for us to get there?

351
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,250
[HOTARU]
Not long now! Stay strong.

352
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,083
We're 562 seconds away!

353
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,875
Um, that seems pretty precise.

354
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,208
Yes!

355
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,875
One caramel is 16 calories,
so here is my math.

356
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
[HOTARU]
If you're 165 centimeters tall

357
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,458
and weigh 55 kilos, then you
should be able to run

358
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,583
approximately 160
meters per minute.

359
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:20,416
So if one caramel equals 312
meters exactly, that means?

360
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,125
That we should make it
there in about 500 seconds!

361
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,083
Well, I weigh in right at
55 kilograms, I bet you do, too!

I'm pretty sure I

Uh, obviously!

Hey! Look!

368
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,000
If we cut over that hill,

369
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,375
It might not be much,
but we can save a little time!

[HOTARU]
Hm?

386
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,833
Hey, is something wrong?

387
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,416
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

388
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,250
According to the candy box,
Glico assumes that we can run

389
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,833
160 meters per minute.

390
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,208
But, I was just thinking.

391
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,125
It's not really a running speed.

392
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,583
I mean, doesn't that seem
a little slow to you?

393
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,541
--[HOTARU chuckles]
--[KOKONOTSU] Huh?

394
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,708
[HOTARU] The national average
of a tenth grade male's

395
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,833
50 meter dash is 7.41 seconds,

396
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,958
which equals out to
404 meters per minute.

397
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,958
So yeah, if you base it on that
math it does seem rather slow,

398
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,625
even if it was calculated
for long distance running.

399
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,458
But there's still
more to consider.

400
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,958
It's a 25 minute walk to
the nearest train station

401
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,083
from your store.

402
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,583
Huh?

403
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,166
What in the heck does that have
to do with running speeds?

404
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,500
Although I guess we are kind of
located in an inconvenient spot.

405
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,000
I'll explain it to you, then!

406
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,458
There are standards set
for measuring distance

407
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,333
from stations.

408
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,875
Real estate companies all agreed

409
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,166
that a patron could walk
about 80 meters per minute.

410
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,916
Okay, well that's good
to know, I guess?

411
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,875
Do you get what I'm saying?

412
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,708
If 80 meters per minute
is walking speed,

413
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,750
and 160 meters per minute
is double that...

414
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,666
[gasps]
It is fast!

415
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,291
It's a running speed after all!

So, the prize was a watch.

478
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,875
[HOTARU] My collection
is finally complete.

479
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,500
[HOTARU]
Master Saya,

480
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,291
did you know women who
are dieting love fugashi?

481
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,375
[SAYA]
Yep!

482
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,583
But even though
they're low in calories,

483
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,208
you still have to eat
them in moderation!

484
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,416
[HOTARU] Yeah, because they're
totally scrumptious!

485
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,708
Maybe if you eat them fast you
could burn some calories!

486
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,083
[SAYA]
What?

487
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,583
[HOTARU] <i>Sakura bou</i> are
90 centimeters long.

488
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,541
If you eat it at a speed of
six centimeters per second,

489
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,625
you can eat it all in
about 15 seconds!

490
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,875
Whoa!

491
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,166
That's slow, should one
bite be ten centimeters?

492
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,583
But we wouldn't
enjoy it as much!

493
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,791
[SAYA]
Huh? Um? What?

494
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,208
[HOTARU] 1 kilogram
of your weight burns

495
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,375
.026 calories every minute.

496
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,083
[SAYA] Enough! Can't we eat
without all this math?
