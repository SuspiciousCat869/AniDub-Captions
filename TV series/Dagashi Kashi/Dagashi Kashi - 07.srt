1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,625
[SAYA]
Closed early?

2
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,208
Oh, that's right.
The festival's tomorrow.

3
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,666
[BOY]
I love the ring toss!

4
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,041
[GIRL]
I wanna do goldfish scooping!

5
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,416
What? Seriously? It's so stupid!

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,666
[GIRL]
Ugh! No it's not!

7
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,541
[BOY]
That game is for babies!

8
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,958
[BOY laughs]

9
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,166
[YO]
All right! Hop on out, kiddo!

10
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,041
[groaning]

11
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,000
Man, my back is killin' me!

12
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,166
You're the one who asked to
ride back there, remember?

13
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,291
Yeah, but... I didn't know
the ride would be so bumpy.

14
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,583
[YO]
Come on.

15
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,416
Help me unload this stuff.

16
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,625
Okay.

17
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,458
I was wonderin'...

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,250
Isn't this hot plate
for making <i>monjayaki?</i>

19
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,000
But I think you would know that.

20
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,500
I mean, we make <i>monja</i> every
year, so why bring it up now?

21
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh.

22
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:54,125
Uh. Well, I guess I'm
just a little bit curious.

23
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,916
[YO]
About?

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,875
[KOKONOTSU] A <i>dagashi</i> shop
setting up a <i>monja</i> stall?

25
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,291
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

26
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,541
Boo!

27
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,916
What's with that goofy face?

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,375
It was totally a
legitimate question!

29
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,583
[HOTARU chuckles]

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,000
[HOTARU] As always,
you have a lot to learn.

31
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,875
I know that voice!

32
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,000
[HOTARU] Once again,
looks like it's up to me

33
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,708
to give you a lesson.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,125
[KOKONOTSU]
And you're in a tree.

35
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,416
I guess we're all gonna act
like that's perfectly normal.

36
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,041
<i>Monja</i> and snacks are a pair.

37
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,000
Why, they're like
peanut butter and jelly!

38
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,708
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

39
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,000
[HOTARU] During the first four
decades of the... Showa Era,

40
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,583
it was common for <i>dagashi</i> shops

41
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,000
in the working
class neighborhoods

42
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,708
to serve <i>monjayaki.</i>

43
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,958
Am I close, yet?

44
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,500
You know; we could just
talk after you get down.

45
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,583
[HOTARU]
Yo, if people ask for it,

46
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,666
can they get <i>monja</i>
at your store?

47
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,208
[YO]
Mh-hm. They sure can.

48
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,666
Hm? Seriously?

49
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916
Yeah, of course.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
But I've never seen any
advertisements for it.

51
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,333
I didn't know that's a thing.

52
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,208
Well, it is a lot of work.

53
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,125
So? That's part of your job!

54
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
Uh...

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,041
[TAMAI]
Yo!

56
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,166
[BOTH]
Huh?

57
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,541
Hey, who's she?

58
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,958
Well, uh...

59
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,708
She's kind of like an old
acquaintance of my dad's.

60
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,833
Tamai! What brings you from
the <i>okonomiyaki</i> stand?

61
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,041
Me, right?

62
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,875
Shut your hole,
you shameless louse!

63
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,208
Is it true you're selling
<i>monja</i> again this year?

64
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,208
That's the rumor.

65
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,750
What the hell?
That's our thing!

66
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,875
Didn't I tell you last
year to stop selling it?

67
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,750
What's the big deal?
Don't you sell <i>okonomiyaki?</i>

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,250
[TAMAI] The big deal is we had
dibs! Stick to candy! Ugh!

69
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,375
[HOTARU]
How odd.

70
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,250
Actually, it's pretty normal.

71
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,375
They're always like
this. Every year.

72
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,416
Oh.

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,916
[TAMAI]
Whatever!

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,666
I'm serious! No more selling
after this year! Understand?

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,250
Yeah, I do, but
sure sucks for you.

76
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,500
Why's that?

77
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,083
You forced me into this.
No more Baby Star Ramen.

78
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,000
[gasps]

79
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,125
[TAMAI]
No.

80
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,541
You wouldn't! That's dirty!

81
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,041
You can't eat <i>monja</i>
without Baby Star on it!

82
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,208
What a cheap trick!
It's not fair!

83
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,833
Yep! Now you see
what I meant earlier.

84
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,708
<i>Dagashi</i> and <i>monja</i> are
like two peas in a pod.

85
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,583
Huh?

86
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,250
You've probably eaten it before.

87
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,875
I've seen them topped with
cheese and tempura bits.

88
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,291
But it's also pretty common

89
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,791
to use <i>dagashi</i> on
top of <i>monjayaki.</i>

90
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,875
[KOKONOTSU]
I see.

91
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,916
[HOTARU] Not only can
you eat <i>dagashi</i> as is,

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,833
but you can also
cook with them!

93
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,333
They are truly a gift
from the heavens above!

94
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,458
Thank you for giving
us such bliss!

95
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,125
[KOKONOTSU]
The heavens sure are economical.

96
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,791
[crying]

97
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,125
[gasps]

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,083
Come on. You know I'm just
givin' you a hard time.

99
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,000
We're still cool, right?

100
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,916
You jerk. You're impossible.

101
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's have another
great festival.

102
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,541
I bet we can sell
more <i>monja</i> than you.

103
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,333
Bring it on!

104
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,458
That's surprising.
They made up fast.

105
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,333
Of course they did. I told
you it's an annual thing.

106
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,625
[YO chuckling]

107
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,041
Huh?

108
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,708
See ya later, Kokonotsu!

109
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,125
We're off to kill some drinks at
the festival eve drinking party.

110
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,666
Do me a favor. Set up
the booth, 'kay?

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,166
Good luck there, buddy!
We believe in you!

112
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,000
No fair, you guys!
Get back here!

113
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,666
They freakin' ignored me.

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,958
Festival eve party.
What's that all about?

115
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,708
Uh... Ah, yes.

116
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,083
It's the "get sloshed
before the festival" party.

117
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,833
A festival?

118
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,125
Yeah, hence the <i>monja</i> booth.
You didn't know that?

119
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,416
No way.

120
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,666
[gasps]

121
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,666
A real life festival!

122
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,625
Am I dreaming?
Is this really happening?

123
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,833
Yep, it sure is.

124
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,375
I've never been to a
festival before! Oh!

125
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,250
It looks like a lot of fun, huh?

126
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

127
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,708
[HOTARU]
I never realized this before,

128
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,750
but your town has quite a
lot of people living in it.

129
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,125
Not exactly.

130
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,375
Most of the people here are
from neighboring towns.

131
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,666
The festival draws in
all kinds of visitors.

132
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,750
[HOTARU]
Huh?

133
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,125
Where's Master Saya?

134
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,375
Uhh, she's being all
girly and getting ready.

135
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,458
Cool.

136
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,291
Now, the more
important question is...

137
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,250
How much money
did you guys bring?

138
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,958
I'm packin' 3,000!

139
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,208
I've got 25 hundred yen.

140
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,916
And I brought 200 yen!

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,458
[BOTH]
What? So little?

142
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,333
You can get maybe one thing
with that. Like shaved ice!

143
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,625
Not even.

144
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,833
I think they raised the
price to 250 this year.

145
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,708
[TO]
For real?

146
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:37,125
Now now, cool your jets, fellas.
Check it, I have a plan.

147
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,791
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh... The die-cutting booth?

148
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,833
[HOTARU]
Yes!

149
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,750
The idea is quite simple.

150
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,708
You choose a design
for die-cutting,

151
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,541
and then try and carve
it as neatly as possible.

152
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,041
If you do well, you
can earn prize money!

153
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,750
The more difficult the design,
the more money you can win!

154
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,291
I'll just choose a hard pattern.

155
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,083
After that, I'll have
more than enough money!

156
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,958
Maybe, but...

157
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,750
How do I say this?
Don't get your hopes up.

158
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,500
Why not?

159
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, to be honest,

160
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,166
the owners of those stalls
don't wanna have to pay out

161
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,000
to winners, so they try to
find faults with your design.

162
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,750
Mister! One for me, please!

163
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,875
[POPS]
Sure thing!

164
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,708
Why does she never listen?!

165
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,250
[HOTARU]
And so...

166
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,208
[HOTARU] The most important
part of die-cutting

167
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,708
is to start with breaking
off any unnecessary pieces

168
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,125
around the design.

169
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,708
That leaves you with only
the detailed parts to do.

170
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,166
Then you just use a toothpick
to slowly carve out the rest.

171
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey, Hotaru?

172
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,666
[HOTARU]
What's on your mind?

173
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,958
Didn't you mention to me earlier

174
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,000
that this was your
first festival?

175
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,500
[HOTARU]
Correct.

176
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,625
So how is it that you know
about die-cutting techniques?

177
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,916
[HOTARU] Die-cutting isn't
just for festivals.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,041
I happen to like it, so I have a
pretty big collection back home.

179
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,250
I used to practice quite a bit.

180
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,583
[KOKONOTSU]
She's full of surprises.

181
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,666
[HOTARU]
However,

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,166
I've never had an audience watch
me die cut anything before.

183
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,833
That makes it all
the more thrilling

184
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,000
when you add in distractions.

185
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,583
[TO chuckles]

186
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,416
Then should I interrupt you
with stupid comments?

187
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,250
Don't make it too thrilling.

188
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,000
She's pretty good at this.

189
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Mh-hm.

190
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,458
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

191
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,583
I think Saya would also
be great at this, y'know?

192
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,708
Yeah, you're probably
right, Coconuts.

193
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,791
She's pretty good
at games and stuff.

194
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,583
This tastes horrible.

195
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,541
It's about as tasty as
sugar and starch can be.

196
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,458
[TO] "She's super cute
when she's concentrating."

197
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,875
Your face says it all, buddy.

198
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,875
What? My face
didn't say anything!

199
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,291
Stop making crap up!

200
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,125
So defensive! You can't
hide from the truth, though.

201
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,541
Just shut up!

202
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,541
Finished!

203
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,416
Hey, mister!

204
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,375
Wow, done already?
She sure does work fast.

205
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,083
Which design was it?

206
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,541
I dunno, a tulip maybe?

207
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,250
[KOKONOTSU, TO]
Whoa!

208
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,375
Five thousand yen?

209
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,958
[KOKONOTSU, TO] He'll definitely
find something wrong with it!

210
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,833
Well then? How is it?

211
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,458
[POPS]
Hm...

212
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,875
It's amazing!

213
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,083
[KOKONOTSU, TO]
Huh?

214
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,291
There's not one single
thing wrong with it!

215
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,708
[chuckles]

216
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,916
[POPS] No one's ever finished
on me that fast before.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,666
You sure surprised this old man!

218
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,208
Sounds kinda pervy, right?

219
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

220
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,875
Oh, before I forget!

221
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,708
Let me get you your prize money.

222
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,958
I hope you'll enjoy
the festival, Miss.

223
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,750
I'm sorry, I never
got your name.

224
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,666
I'm Hotaru Shidare.
Of Shidare Company.

225
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,125
Don't forget it, okay?

226
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,750
[POPS]
As if I could.

227
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
[POPS]
Yes, as long as I live,

228
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:53,166
I'll never forget
you, Miss Shidare.

229
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,500
[HOTARU] I'm gonna go
look for Master Saya.

230
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,583
Then we'll eat all the food
our stomachs can hold!

231
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,958
Good luck with that.

232
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,666
She'll never find Saya
in this huge crowd.

233
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,541
You know? What do
you think? Huh? To?

234
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,750
I think I wanna try die-cutting.

235
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,375

What?

Hey, Pops!

Whoa, hold up a sec!

00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,500
You don't even
have any practice!

Finally!

240
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,666
Are you done?

241
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,875
I am!

242
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,250
See? I told you I'd
succeed sooner or later!

243
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,458
Yeah, good for you.

Not anymore.

00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,166
What?

320
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Maybe check out the competition.

321
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,000
Y'know, let me know
how they look and stuff.

322
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,375
Besides, you shouldn't make Saya
walk around the festival alone.

323
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,250
She just got here. Why don't
you chillax with her for a bit?

324
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh? For real?

325
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,333
[YO]
Sure.

326
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,541
Yay!

327
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,625
You ready? Let's go!

328
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,500
[SAYA]
Oh. Okay!

329
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
[chuckles]

330
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,625
Back to work!

331
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:54,958
Excuse me.

332
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,625
Oh. What's up, To?

333
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,500
Could I maybe help?
Like with the cooking?

334
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,083
Huh? Are you sure?

335
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,250
Yeah. I wanna at least
repay you for the sandwich.

336
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,458
[CUSTOMER A]
Is my order ready?

337
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,333
[YO]
Uh! Comin' right up!

338
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,416
Here ya go, sorry
about the wait.

339
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,083
Thanks and have a great night!

340
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,541
All right, who's next?

341
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,333
[CUSTOMER B]
I'd like five <i>monja</i> sandwiches.

342
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,583
[YO]
Yes ma'am!

343
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,916
Whoa! You're a natural!

344
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,375
You think so?

345
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,000
Sure, you're a big help, kid.

346
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,458
Man, I'm so glad to be free!

347
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,500
It's nice to finally
walk around a bit.

348
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,875
Yeah. I'm glad you could come.

349
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,083
Oh! I should've
invited To along.

350
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,125
No! Forget that loser!

351
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,708
Huh? Why?

352
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,000
[SAYA]
Uh...

353
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,958
Well, he was eating.

354
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:46,333
And he's happy when
he eats. Why ruin that?

355
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,625
I guess.

356
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,541
Oh, and I noticed you're
wearing a uniform today.

357
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,333
You and your dad totally match!

358
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,083
Yeah, this thing?

359
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,666
Yo was insistant that
I wear it today.

360
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,333
And I had to comb my hair back.

361
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,708
I feel like I look
really dumb, y'know?

362
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,916
Nah, I think it makes
you look kinda cool.

363
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Seriously?

364
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,250
[SAYA]
Yep.

365
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,125
Hey, forget about me.

366
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,875
Just look at you, Saya.

367
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,250
You're really
rockin' that yukata.

368
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

369
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
Somethin' wrong?

370
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,000
[chuckles nervously]

371
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,333
No everything's perfectly fine!

372
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,791
So rockin'! You charmer you!

373
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,833
I hate to ruin the
moment, but it hurts.

374
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,291
Oh! Sorry about that!

375
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,750
[SAYA] It's been a while, but
I'm glad I wore a yukata today.

376
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,875
[SAYA]
Look, cotton candy!

377
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,333
Hey, you ever notice festivals
always have cotton candy?

378
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,166
Yeah!

379
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,208
Kids sure seem to like it.

380
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,541
Isn't it pretty much
made from pure sugar?

381
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,166
[KOKONOTSU]
Granulated sugar, to be exact.

382
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,250
Cotton candy actually has
a long and unique history.

383
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,625
It originated in Russia
during the Meiji era.

384
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,125
[SAYA] Really? So it's
not a Japanese snack?

385
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Nope.

386
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,416
And guess where the first cotton
candy machine was invented?

387
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,166
It came from America.

388
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,125
Oh, wow!

389
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh.

390
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,250
Look there, speaking of America.

391
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,833
Did you know that candy
apples are also American?

392
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,916
Typically you see them around
Christmas time though.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,333
How crazy. And we eat
them in the summer!

394
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,833
It is all backwards!

395
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,750
[BOTH laughing]

396
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,666
If they were here, I wonder
what an American would think.

397
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,166
Do we look weird for eating
candy apples in the summer?

398
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,625
Yeah, maybe.
Who knows for sure?

399
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,750
[inaudible]

400
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,625
[SAYA] This night is
the best night ever!

401
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,375
Man, those games sure were fun!

402
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,041
Well now, where should
we head to next, Saya?

403
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,458
Any place in particular
you wanna go?

404
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:35,333
Huh? Uh... Where to?

405
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh! Goldfish scooping, huh?

406
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,333
Looks fun! I haven't
played in ages. Wanna try?

407
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,791
[SAYA]
Uh...

408
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
Heh. What's wrong?

409
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,291
We can do something
else if you want.

410
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,541
[SAYA]
No, I'd like to.

411
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,083
It's just... Remember
when we were kids?

412
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,583
Which time?

413
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,958
[WOMAN A]
Hey there, you two!

414
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,958
You guys wanna play?
Only a hundred yen per try!

415
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,041
Oh well. I don't know.

416
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,125
Right. I feel lucky.

417
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
[SAYA]
Huh?

418
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,250
[KOKONOTSU]
I'd like to try please.

419
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,041
[WOMAN A]
Okay!

420
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,833
[SAYA] Listen, I'm not
trying to be mean,

421
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,041
but winning these games
isn't really your forte.

422
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,750
[KOKONOTSU chuckles]

423
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,166
Don't you worry!

424
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,250
In goldfish scooping, there's
a sure fire way to win!

425
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,708
Step one, gently place
the scoop in the water.

426
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,541
Make sure it's at
a 45 degree angle.

427
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,333
Step number two, while
keeping the scoop sideways,

428
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:47,000
slowly move it while trying
to avoid any water resistance.

429
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,458
Step three, target the
goldfish and attack!

430
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,583
[yells]

431
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,250
That's too bad.
Your scoop broke.

432
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
One more please! Thank you!

433
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,541
[WOMAN A]
Heh. Good luck!

434
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,375
[SAYA]
Oh, Coconuts. He hasn't changed.

435
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,875
It's funny,

436
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,791
but he said the same thing
about winning back then, too.

437
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,958
[yells]

438
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,875
Rats, your scoop got torn.

439
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Mister, one more please!

440
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,666
[SAYA] He spent all
his money at that booth,

441
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,125
and yet he never won
even one single fish.

442
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,916
But since he tried so hard,

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,750
the stall owner gave
him a fish for free.

444
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,083
I don't think I'll
ever forget that day.

445
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,125
[SAYA] And that special goldfish
still lives with us at the café.

446
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Look, Saya.

447
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,458
Here! For you.

448
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,291
[KOKONOTSU] I really tried,
but I couldn't catch a fish.

449
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,416
So the lady gave
me one for free.

450
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,708
Wait. You don't
want it? Sorry...

451
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,541
No, yes! I really do want it!

452
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,916
I was just surprised is all.

453
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,583
Oh, you were?

454
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,833
Well, good! You looked like
you wanted one, so ta-dah!

455
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,166
Thanks a lot. I love it!

456
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,625
[HOTARU]
Master Saya!

457
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,333
[SAYA]
Uh...

458
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,750
Kokonotsu!

459
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,583
Quick! Come and see this!

460
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,916
Endo's got mad
<i>monja</i> -making skills!

461
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,500
[TO laughing]

462
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,833
I started making these
in Coconuts' place,

463
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,708
and it turns out I'm
like crazy awesome!

464
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh...

465
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,583
Shall we go?

466
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,625
[SAYA]
Mh-hm!

467
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,958
[HOTARU] Wanna know my secret
trick on how to eat for free

468
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,000
at a festival?

469
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:54,750
[SAYA]
Yeah!

470
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,291
[HOTARU]
Well,

471
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,250
all you have to do is go to
the stall with the food ya like

472
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,958
when the festival's almost over,
then you get what's left!

473
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,583
[SAYA]
What? They just give 'em away?

474
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,750
[HOTARU]
Indeed!

475
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,083
They don't wanna carry
it all back home.

476
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,083
[SAYA]

So if you're low on cash,

478
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,958
you can just hang around and get
free snacks when it's all done!

00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,125

A-ha!

480
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,541
Something tells me
that you actually blew

481
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,416
all the money you won at
the beginning of the festival

482
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,833
on more die-cutting, didn't you?

483
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,083
[HOTARU]
Guilty as charged!

484
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,041
[SAYA]
I knew it!
