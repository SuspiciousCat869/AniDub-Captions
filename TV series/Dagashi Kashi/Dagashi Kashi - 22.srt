160
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,083
Hey, what day is today, Yutaka?

161
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,625
It's Friday.

162
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,041
Seriously, can't you just wait
and read that at your house?

163
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,250
The deadline's in two days!

164
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,583
[KOKONOTSU] If I put my mind
to it, I can finish in time.

165
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,291
Then I'll take it to the manga
review event on Sunday.

166
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,750
[KOKONOTSU] Judging by
the required page count,

167
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,583
and the time I have left,

168
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,041
I can make it.

169
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,208
[KOKONOTSU groans]

170
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,958
[KOKONTOSU]
This is really bad.

171
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,500
It's taking longer than
I thought it would.

172
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,333
[KOKONOTSU] At this rate,
I won't be able to finish it

173
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,833
before the review event.

174
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:15,916
It's all my fault.
I should've worked faster.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,333
No, I should've been
working on it every day.

176
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:28,333
[KOKONOTSU] Forget it. I'll just
have to give up this time.

177
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,916
[HAJIME]
Manager?

178
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,916
Some of your friends
are downstairs.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,333
Oh, hey.

180
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,208
Awesome! Is this
yours? It's cool.

181
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,500
Oh, it's nothing special!
It's more like a stupid hobby!

182
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,833
And haven't you ever
heard of knocking?

183
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,083
But I did knock.

184
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,791
Huh?

185
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,875
Sunday Review event?

186
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,750
Are you submitting something?

187
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,833
Uh, I am. I mean, I'm not.

188
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,291
It's kinda complicated.

189
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,958
[HAJIME]
Seriously?

190
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,833
You're going to be a real
manga artist? That's so cool!

191
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,666
You should've told me sooner!

192
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,083
Best of luck at the
review event on Sunday!

193
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,041
I'll totes be rooting for you!

194
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:15,791
Listen, I appreciate that,
but I'm not gonna finish it.

195
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,750
There's no time,
so I'll have to pass.

196
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,333
Don't you worry!

197
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,500
You've got me to help,

198
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,958
so you're totally gonna
make that review!

199
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,083
Huh? But--

200
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,416
I've got your back! I bet your
friends will help out, too!

201
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,000
[TO]
We heard everything.

202
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,041
[SAYA] Yeah, I'll help
out any way I can.

203
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,041
It sounds kinda fun. You'd
better count me in, too.

204
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,250
Saya, To. You guys.

205
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,916
Of course, I can't draw,

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,708
but I can make coffee to
help keep you energized.

207
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,500
Well, I guess it's up to me.

208
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,541
I'll play video games and keep
you posted on my progress!

209
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,125
Uh, thank you.

210
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,125
And I can handle the backgrounds
and any other grunt work.

211
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,833
Really?

212
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,000
Is it possible? Have you
done this before?

213
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,333
Don't worry, I do work
for you after all.

214
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,250
If my boss is in trouble,
I have to help however I can.

215
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,083
Okay! All right, let's do this!

216
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,250
[HAJIME]
Let's see. I need a desk.

217
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,541
[SAYA]
I'll go start a pot of coffee.

218
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,250
[TO]
Hey, it won't turn on!

219
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Next time:

220
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,625
"Homerun Bar Winning
Stick, Snow, and..."

221
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,750
No way, it can't be!
