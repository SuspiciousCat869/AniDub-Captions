She probably can't eat any
because she doesn't feel well.

C'mon. It's obvious her
throat is bothering her.

164
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,041
[KOKONOTSU] No, that's
not the Hotaru I know.

165
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,625
She would never let sickness
keep her from <i>dagashi!</i>

[KOKONOTSU]
Ooh, what's this?

170
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,583
It's a famous snack with an
elephant drawing on the lid.

171
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,375
[HOTARU]
What?

172
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,750
Why an elephant?

173
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,500
Because the snack's
container resembles

174
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,750
the shape of an elephant's foot.

175
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,583
Inside the container is a
tasty sweet and sour yogurt.

Yes! It's Morocco Fruit Yogul!

goin' there for a minute.

Well. Go ahead and
take one if you want.

182
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:50,791
Now what?

183
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,541

I'm not hungry.

You want the cabbage taro?

Dammit. I won't give up.

And she shouldn't be eating

[SAYA]
Yeah.

Is that it? Why you can't eat?

It's hard to believe.

I thought it'd take
more than that

to keep you away from <i>dagashi.</i>

[KOKONOTSU]
Right.

I can't imagine you'd
let an ulcer stop you.

I think it's getting worse.

Maybe eating <i>watapachi</i>
and Sakura Daikon

But what does that have
to do with not eating?

320
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,791
you know what I mean?

321
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,041
Besides, with the way
things are going right now,

322
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,875
there's no way it's gonna heal
up before the release date.

323
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,958
But still!

324
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Why don't you just try?

325
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,250
If anything it'll taste
even better that way.

326
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,291
Don't things taste better if
you haven't had 'em in a while?

327
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,666
Maybe you're right. Baby Star
is already super amazing.

328
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,333
[TO]
For sure. You fast then...

329
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,791
Pure bliss!

330
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,583
For a flash back it sure is hot.

331
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,458
I would kill for some AC.

332
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,875
Guess I'll settle
for a cold drink.

333
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:36,416
[giggling]

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,083
Now you know. I'm fasting.
For Baby Star Ramen-- Oh!

335
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:41,958
Geez.

Don't get me wrong.

338
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,458
I guess To's advice
sort of made sense.

339
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,291
Or he could've told her
to take some medicine.

340
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
What a relief.

341
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,166
At least now we know why
she isn't eating <i>dagashi.</i>

342
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,000
Deep down, she's the
same snack-loving Hotaru.

343
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,125
[SAYA]
I'm glad.

344
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,333
But now I feel bad about
bringing those snacks, y'know?

345
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

No, don't!

Stop it! You've been
doing good, don't ruin it!

[KOKONOTSU]
Wait a minute.

354
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,000
She's moving like
some kind of zombie,

355
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,666
like she's not in control
of her own body!

What?!

00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,625
[SAYA]
No!

00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,083
You're better than this!

359
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,458
Don't let all your effort
go to waste! Hang in there!

360
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,791
Don't give up!

Please Hotaru, come back
to us! We believe in you!

00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,958
Almost, got it!

00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,166
Yeah!

[ALL yelp]

00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,666
[HOTARU]
Uh...

367
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,000
Medicine.

368
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,708
Seriously? You have
some meds? Where?

369
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,583
In the fridge-- Oh!

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,958
[SAYA]
Here.

371
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,375
Take some.

00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,541
Thank you, Master Saya.

373
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,708
You okay?

374
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm fine.

375
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,791
The flavor's just a
little overwhelming.

376
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,333
What can you do, though?

377
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,500

Uh...

What the hell is this?

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,500
It's looks like a hippie
threw up in your bowl!

381
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,791
[HOTARU]
Well yeah.

382
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,500
The color is a bit crazy,
but it's effective!

383
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,166
[SAYA groans]

384
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,583
It's weird, though.

385
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,375
Right after I take it, I
start to feel a little better

386
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,416
and get some of my energy back.

387
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,791
Unfortunately, my ulcer
always feels worse afterwards.

[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

it smells amazing!

00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,000
Wait a sec.

Can I see that?
Just for a minute.

Yes?

Tell me,

399
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,333
what are the ingredients used
to make this medicine?

400
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,875
Let's see. Hang on,
I'm trying to think.

401
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Pineapple.

402
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,958
Melon.

403
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,333
And lastly, its main
ingredient is...

404
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,333
...American Cola.

405
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,333
[SAYA gasps]

406
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,333
Wait, are you serious?

407
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,375
You're astute, as usual.

408
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
But no big surprise there.

00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,958
As expected from my rival. Uh?

We were sincerely
worried about you.

[HOTARU]
Uh? Uh...?

415
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,125
You really don't know
why your ulcer is worse?

00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,291
[HOTARU]
Huh?

417
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,875
[KOKONOTSU groans]

418
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Look at these.

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,375
They're pineapple and melon
flavored drink mixes.

420
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,875
Made by the same company
who makes American Cola.

421
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,583
Normally they taste
pretty awesome,

422
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,125
but that's if they're separate.

423
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,875
[HOTARU] Usually I would
drink them separately

424
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,916
depending on the
symptom I wanna treat.

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,791
But desperate times call
for desperate measures.

426
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,583
So I mixed together everything
I bought at Kokonotsu's shop.

427
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,291
Hmm? Kokonotsu's shop.

Wait, you guys!
Don't leave! Oww.

433
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,916
[HOTARU]
Mmm.

434
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,916
Whatever this stuff
is miracle juice!

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,583
[BOTH]
It's not a miracle!

436
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,375
It's <i>dagashi,</i> dammit!

437
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,416
[HOTARU] There's pineapple,
grape, melon, and orange,

438
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,708
but did you know there's
a fresh soda flavor too?

439
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,833
[SAYA] Those are drink mixes,
like American Cola right?

440
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,166
[HOTARU]
Yes!

441
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,375
But I bet you didn't know
that there's another way

442
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,416
to enjoy them besides
just drinking them!

443
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,916
[SAYA]
Huh? What do you mean?

444
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,500
[HOTARU]
I mean you can mix them!

445
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,958
[SAYA] Didn't Coconuts
say they taste better

446
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,416
if you drink them separately?

447
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,708
[HOTARU] Yes, but it's more
fun to create new flavors

448
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,333
by trying out different combos!

449
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,125
[SAYA]
I guess.

450
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,708
[HOTARU] I said it's important
to make <i>dagashi</i> last, right?

451
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,458
The same's true for
these drink mixes.

452
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,625
[SAYA] Oh! I do remember.
Well played, Hotaru!
