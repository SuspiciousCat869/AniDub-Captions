1
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,833
[YO]
Hotaru.

2
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,625
Thanks for meeting me so late.

3
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,708
[HOTARU] Sure, did you
get the good stuff?

4
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,791
[YO]
Only the best.

5
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,541
[HOTARU]
There's just one way to be sure.

6
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,958
[chuckles]

7
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,291
[sighs]

8
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,166
I told you it
was high quality.

9
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,541
[YO, HOTARU shout]

10
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,875
It's the middle of the night.

11
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,583
This is weird, even for you two.

12
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,875
Oh, Kokonotsu!

13
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,916
Wow, fancy meeting you here!

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,375
[KOKONOTSU] Um, is it?

15
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:26,291
My house, remember?
So what's going on?

16
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,958
Whoa, hold up.

17
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,416
Why the heck are
you hiding your face?

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,125
Because! I'm obviously
making a sketchy deal!

19
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,333
Yo, do you even hear yourself?

20
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,875
Sketchy deals aren't
supposed to be obvious!

21
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,458
[YO sighs]
I guess that's true.

22
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,583
I don't suppose I could
convince you to turn

23
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,541
a blind eye to this transaction?

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey! A Bottle <i>Ramune!</i>

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,375
I haven't seen one
of these in forever!

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,125
Our shop doesn't
carry it, right?

27
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,250
[BOTH gasp]

28
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Which is kind of strange,

29
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,125
because I remember selling
them at one point in time.

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, about that.

31
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
I've actually been
ordering some, but...

32
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,125
But?

33
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,333
I kinda sort of
accidentally ate it all.

34
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,375
[KOKONOTSU]
All of it?!

35
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,041
Stop, just leave him alone!

36
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,083
Look, this isn't
Yo's fault, okay?

37
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,791
Hotaru don't.

38
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm the one who asked
him to get it for me!

39
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,666
Besides, this stuff is legal!

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,208
We're totally innocent, dammit!

41
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,208
If you're so innocent,
then why are you shouting?

42
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,666
[HOTARU]
Everything's fine!

43
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,291
I mean, it's not like it's
super addictive or anything!

44
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,541
So, nothing to see here!

45
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,375
[YO groans]

46
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,458
I need my fix!

47
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,833
I'm going through withdrawals!

48
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,291
[KOKONOTSU] Only addicts
go through withdrawals!

49
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,916
Now, now, "addict"
is a strong word.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,291
We're just fans!

51
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,166
Give it a try,
you might like it!

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,416
Well...?!

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,666
Don't just stand there,
hurry up already!

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,958
Go ahead and chug it like
there's no tomorrow!

55
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,791
Fine. Calm down,
and I'll try it.

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,541
Chug! Chug! Chug...!

57
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,750
[KOKONOTSU] Please stop,
you're freaking me out.

58
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,291
Alright, here goes nothin'.

59
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,625
[coughing]

60
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:02,000
The first time is always
the hardest. It gets easier.

61
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,125
[KOKONOTSU coughing] I just got
some powder stuck in my throat.

62
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,208
Don't worry.
Your body will adjust.

63
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,750
Right now you're
still a new user,

64
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,291
but you'll be a pro in no time!

65
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,541
Are you trying to make it sound
like you're a drug addict?

66
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,333
But I have to agree.

67
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,958
Even though I almost
choked to death,

68
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,958
the <i>Ramune</i> powder
was pretty good.

69
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,583
Like, the flavor is
really refreshing, y'know?

70
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,541
Oh, yes! Yes, I do know!

71
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,458
[KOKONOTSU] What a perfect
snack for a hot summer night

72
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,833
like this one.

73
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,375
For sure. Those rumors are lies.

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,250
It's in no way
dangerously addicting,

75
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,833
but metaphorically speaking,

76
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,708
you should try not
to consume too much.

77
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,875
[KOKONOTSU] Why did you wait to
say that until after I tried it?

78
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,750
Listen, I really
like this snack,

79
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,500
but you just ruined it for me,
maybe you should fix that.

80
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,916
[YO]
Oh, I know!

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,166
Look, this will
make you love it.

82
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,875
You can take out the straw...

83
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,541
[HOTARU chuckles]

84
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,791
[YO]
...and then eat the bottle!

85
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,833
Cool! Two snacks in one!

86
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,000
[YO grunts]

87
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,625
--[HOTARU, KOKONOTSU] Huh?
--[YO whimpers]

88
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,666
The wafer edges are sharp.

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,416
I think it cut the
inside of my cheek.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,791
I got an ouchie.

91
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,791
Baby.

92
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,541
[HOTARU giggles]
Sharp edges aside,

93
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,625
good point number two
will really impress you!

94
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,125
Ha! The bunny on the
front is totally adorable!

95
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,333
And he knows it!

96
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,958
But the best part is
there are a ton of ways

97
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,416
to eat Bottle <i>Ramune!</i>

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,916
I know all of them!

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,708
First, I'll explain
the official method

100
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,333
as confirmed by the company.

101
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,291
You stick the straw into
the bottom of the bottle

102
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,125
and eat it that way.

103
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,708
Next is the standard method,

104
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,833
which you and Yo
were just employing.

105
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,208
It's simple.

106
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,166
I think most people prefer
the standard technique.

107
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,541
Thirdly,

108
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,708
hardcore foodies
puncture the <i>Ramune</i> bottle

109
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,791
and catch the yummy
powder in their mouths!

110
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,416
This way is called,
"Mischievous Boy"!

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,833
And finally, for the fourth
snack eating method.

112
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,625
You tear it apart
like an animal!

113
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,000
This is the Manly way!

114
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:54,208
Well, what do you think?
Do you love it again?

115
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,250
Yeah, I suppose.

116
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,458
I don't think it really
matters much though.

117
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean, it's not like we
can actually sell them.

118
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,041
Especially since
Captain Speedo here

119
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,416
likes hoarding it
all for himself.

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,875
Eating all of the product
is really bad for business.

121
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,708
[YO gasps]

122
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,500
What should I do?

123
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,958
Well step one,
admit you have a problem.

124
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,791
Okay then.

125
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,541
[YO]
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,208
[gasps]

127
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,541
I'll fix this.

128
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,583
Once I'm clean you can be
proud of me again, deal?

129
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,875
--[KOKONOTSU] Uh...
--[HOTARU gasps] Wait for me!

130
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,291
You can't do this alone!

131
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,291
[gasps] What are you
two talking about?

132
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,166
Listen kid, You know this
won't be an easy journey.

133
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,625
I know.

134
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,416
Then let's get goin'.

135
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,875
[gasps]

136
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Well, I'm going back to bed.

137
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,666
Weirdos.

138
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,291
[owl hoots]

139
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,416
[YO] Yo. Yo. Here we go, Yo!
Yo, Yo, the more you know, Yo!

140
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,875
You, you, snack review, dude!
You, you, gotta love food!

141
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,750
--Me. Me, what will I eat?
--What time is it?

142
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,833
Man, what is Dad up to now?

143
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,041
[YO] What's up snack lovers
from another mother?

144
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,833
It's that time again!

145
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,166
Today, I'm gonna review
the snack, Baby-Star Ramen.

146
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,916
Let's get ready to crumble!

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,916
'Kay! For my tenth video on,
"Dagashi Channel, Yo!"

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,375
[gasps]

149
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,625
[KOKONOTSU]
It's the middle of the night.

150
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,791
What's wrong with you?

151
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,750
[YO]
Oh, hey.

152
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,166
[sighs]

153
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,541
Are you serious?

154
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,958
I can't believe you actually
started a video blog.

155
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
And it's all about snacks.

156
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,250
Big surprise.

157
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,250
Well, now. Don't knock it.

158
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,541
I'm just trying to make
a little extra money.

159
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,875
I've heard some people can
earn 20 million a year

160
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,083
making videos.

161
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,166
They get roughly around
10,000 views a day,

162
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,791
it's amazing!

163
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,333
[KOKONOTSU]
How many views do you get?

164
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,458
Uh...! Approximately speaking,

165
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,333
like thirteen.

166
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,541
That's pathetic!

167
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,458
No wonder you're so broke!

168
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,791
Aww... I guess you're right.

169
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,833
Do you think you
could watch me record

170
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,250
and tell me what I can
do to improve, maybe?

171
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,125
I'm not an expert, but sure.

172
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,666
[YO]
<i>Yosh!</i>

173
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay then, I'll just
set it up real quick.

174
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,541
There, are you ready?

175
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,041
Yep.

176
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,208
Yo. Yo. Here we go, Yo!

177
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,416
Yo. Yo...

178
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
[KOKONOTSU]
He made up his own theme song?

179
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,958
[YO]
Behold!

180
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,541
Today's dagashi review is
all about Baby-Star Ramen!

181
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,125
Let's see.

182
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,250
-- Uh...
--[gasps, groans]

183
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,083
Uh, did you guys know this
is a ramen type snack?

184
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,333
And who here doesn't
love ramen, am I right?

185
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,416
[YO]
Hm...

186
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,625
Whoa!

187
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,166
Can you believe this
was invented in 1959?

188
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,583
Of course I already knew that!

189
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,458
The more you know, Yo!

190
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,458
Uh, even though it's
been around for a while,

191
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,416
my shop, Shikada Dagashi
has been around longer!

192
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,750
Back then it was only
called Baby Ramen.

193
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,208
The more you know, Yo!

194
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,500
Next!

195
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,250
I'll give it a try,
snack review dude!

196
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,791
Yep! Tastes awesome!

197
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,916
It's very ramen-like.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,083
The texture is texture-y?

199
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,250
No, wait.

200
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,291
Texture. Is that the right word?

201
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,708
You suck at this!

202
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,875
One, there's no such
thing as texture-y!

203
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,000
And two, there are more
things to talk about!

204
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
For example, you could
tell them about how

205
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,416
Baby-Star Ramen was
born from instant ramen!

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,750
Yeah!

207
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,750
The company's owner didn't
want to waste the crumbs

208
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,125
that fell off the ramen
while it was drying.

209
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,250
So he flavored it all and
gave them to his employees!

210
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,416
They liked it, and so
Baby-Star Ramen was born!

211
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,791
That's right.

212
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,500
People like stories like that.

213
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,000
Your reviews should include
all kinds of facts.

214
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,375
There's way more to <i>dagashi</i> than
just how it tastes, y'know?

215
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,666
[YO]
Makes sense!

216
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,833
For instance.

217
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,666
You could even talk
about the mascot.

218
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,666
You mean, Bei-chan?

219
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Right?

220
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,666
Actually, there are two mascots.

221
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,625
The boy is called Bei-chan,
and his sister is Bi-chan.

222
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,583
[YO]
Oh yeah!

223
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,125
Their mom is a fashion designer

224
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,291
and their dad is
an author, right?

225
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,333
[KOKONOTSU] Yes, and Bei-chan
goes on lots of adventures!

226
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
He wears special costumes
that his mom makes

227
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,166
and gets to travel.

228
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,708
He's had miso ramen
up in Hokkaido,

229
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,500
gyoza <i>senbei</i> crackers
in Utsunomiya,

230
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,083
and ate ramen <i>yaki</i> in Hakata.

231
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,375
Bei-chan has even traveled
to other countries!

232
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,875
It's pretty cool stuff.

233
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,916
Yeah, I knew all that.

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,833
So talk about it in your
stupid video, genius!

235
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,208
But I can't!

236
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,041
[whines] The other snack
review videos beat me to it.

237
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,125
Then we'll reveal
our secret weapon.

238
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,208
Something only a few
people know about.

What?

240
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,250
[KOKONOTSU]
The meaning behind the star!

241
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,708
The word "star" in its
name expresses a wish!

242
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,125
A wish for the <i>dagashi</i> to
become the brightest star

243
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,625
in the sky of snacks!

[KOKONOTSU] Then we'll
reveal our secret weapon.

The word "star" in its

Isn't it amazing?

254

I can't believe it racked up
that many views so fast.

Talk about awesome!

for <i>dagashi</i> burns brighter

257
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,250
than the Baby-Star ramen star!

258
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,625
Is it okay if we watch it again?

259
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,916
For sure! It's so cool!

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,916

Jeez, I'm seriously
strapped for cash.

How much you got?

Uh, like twenty.

271
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,166
I should be
lending you money.

Aw... I've watched
the shop a lot lately.

273
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,750
I should ask dad to
pay me or something.

[HOTARU] Well, well, sounds like
you need some dough.

Good to see you.

That face.

And those sunglasses.

I can't put my finger on it,
but it reminds me of something.

Oh, it's nothing important.

Hold up, To.

suspicious pyramid schemes.

Don't be silly!

just made it more suspicious.

with anyone before!

Huh?

00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,500

like with popsicles.

rains down from the sky!

Oh yeah!

317

It doesn't rain from the sky.
It's just a cash voucher.

00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,250
you can exchange that voucher
for 20 yen worth of <i>dagashi.</i>

321
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,541
Aw, so no cash?

322
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,000
Man, what a stupid prize.

323
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,583
--[HOTARU] Anyway.
--[BOTH] Hm?

324
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,166
You can turn in your cash
voucher thing for more snacks,

325
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,166
increasing your chances
of winning again.

326
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,875
It's a fool-proof
money making machine!

327
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,625
You lose.

328
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,000
What?! That's not even
remotely fool proof!

329
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,750
And you just lost!

330
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,708
[HOTARU]
True, so true.

331
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm a big fat loser.

332
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,708
I don't deserve a cash voucher.

333
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,083
But I can't give
up yet, because...

[KOKONOTSU, TO gasp]

...I have hope!

336
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,916
There's a rumor floating
around the <i>dagashi</i> world

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,541
that there's a way to tell
which Yatta-men are winners!

338
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,166
[KOKONOTSU]
Really?

339
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,166
Ah, I get it, so that's what
your money-making technique

340
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,916
is really about!

Let's see...

00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,333
[HOTARU gasps]
Here's one!

345
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,500
[HOTARU]
Notice anything?

346
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,916
Like maybe how the lid
is pressed in on it?

Hm...

This is one is a winner!

349
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,041
For real?

350
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,916
[HOTARU]
According to the rumors.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh.

352
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,750
I don't know,
that's not what I heard.

353
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,916
See, what someone told me was,

354
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,416
If there's space between the
arrow and the corner where it

355
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,791
opens on the lid,
then it's a winner.

[HOTARU]
What?

357
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,625
There's another rumor?

358
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,416
Oh, but it does look like it
presses in pretty easily.

359
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,750
No way!

We'll test all the rumors
and see which one is true!

Can I tell you both a secret?

else for that matter.

[KOKONOTSU gasps]
Nothing?

405
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,416
But then why did you
say all that stuff earlier

406
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,125
about makin' money by
finding winning snacks?

407
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,666
I just wanted to believe.

408
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,250
Believe that I can be lucky too.

409
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,125
Look, Hotaru,

410
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,375
even innocent gambling like
this can be dangerous.

411
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,833
[HOTARU]
I know.

412
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,250
[chuckles]

413
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,250
[HOTARU]
By the way, Kokonotsu.

414
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,041
Let's move on to the next event!

415
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,083
We'll use Sour Grape
to decide your fate!

Lose, and you have to
take over the store!

417
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,541
I just said that
gambling was dangerous!

418
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,875
Also, why do you think
I would make a stupid bet

419
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,916
that would decide my future?

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,791
Uh, now then. Endo to be fair,

421
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,041
I think you should be in
the competition, as well.

422
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,166
[TO]
Huh? Sounds cool.

423
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Don't ignore me!

424
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,958
[HOTARU]
And so...

425
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,208
[HOTARU] Each package of
"Watch Out for the Sour Grape"

426
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,000
has three pieces of gum.

427
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,416
They look the same, but one
of them is extremely sour.

428
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,666
Oh...!

429
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,000
The sour flavor
was unintentional.

430
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,208
The company accidentally
mixed in the wrong amount

431
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,666
of citric acid.

432
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,500
When their boss tried the gum,

433
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,000
he fainted in agony over
its unexpected sourness.

434
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,625
The company thought
it was hilarious,

435
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,083
so they commercialized it!

436
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,083
A story like that definitely
makes this a <i>dagashi!</i>

437
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,083
Life, like food, is full of
surprises and coincidences,

438
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,041
and sometimes you
gotta roll with it!

439
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,458
Basically, this match is
about picking a piece of gum

440
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,625
at random, and if it's
the sour one, you lose?

441
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,125
Yes, exactly right!

442
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,750
Sounds simple enough, Coconuts.

443
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,625
Um... Huh?

444
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,708
Wha--

445
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,750
Well yeah, about that.
It sounds dumb, but,

446
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,208
this match is actually
pretty important to me.

447
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,375
Because your whole future
hangs in the balance?

448
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,458
Dude, don't even sweat it.
It's the two of against her.

449
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,875
Remember how earlier she said

450
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,291
she's never won
anything in her life?

451
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,458
Yeah, I remember.

452
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,541
But despite that she
seems oddly confident.

453
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,750
I mean, what if she
actually wins, huh?

454
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,958
[HOTARU]
You're right to worry.

455
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,791
I just so happen to have
an ace up my sleeve.

456
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,041
As it turns out,
there's a very easy way

457
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,708
to know which piece of
gum is the sour grape.

458
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:12,500
[gasping]

459
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,958
Are you okay, Hotaru?

460
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,375
T-The sunglasses!

461
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,333
What, sunglasses?

462
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,250
Oh, on the package.

463
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,250
They changed it
up recently, yeah.

464
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,000
And got rid of the grape
with the sunglasses on it.

465
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,166
[TO]
Mm...

466
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,166
[HOTARU] Oh man, I have
majorly messed up!

467
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,625
There was a grape on the old
package wearing sunglasses.

468
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,583
You could depend
on the sour grape

469
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,833
always being right
beneath that one!

470
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,708
I was so positive that
I couldn't lose this match.

471
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,416
But how could I forget the
company went and changed

472
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,708
its stupid packaging! Now I
have no idea which one is sour!

473
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,875
[TO]
What about you?

474
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,541
[gasps] Oh, sorry,
did you say something?

475
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,041
Just wondering.

476
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,541
What happens if you're the one
who picks the sour grape?

477
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,583
[HOTARU]
Me?

478
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
Well, I haven't
thought about it,

479
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,291
but I'll do anything
you want, I guess.

480
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,333
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

481
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,750
Anything?

482
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,083
Coconuts.

483
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,208
It's obvious that you're
thinking dirty thoughts.

484
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,916
[gasps]
You shut your pervy mouth!

485
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Anyway, let's do this.

486
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,625
Is it okay if I pick first?

487
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,958
Ah! Sure, yeah, go right ahead.

488
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Well...

489
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,750
[gasps]

490
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:23,833
[KOKONOTSU]
This one.

491
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,500
Actually, wait!

492
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,875
As it turns out,

493
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,125
Would it be too much to ask
if I could choose first?

494
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,333
Um, no. Be my guest.

495
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,541
[HOTARU grunts]

496
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,791
[HOTARU]
Uh...

497
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,291
[HOTARU]
Which one?

498
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,875
If only the sunglasses-wearing
grape was here!

499
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,125
[gasps]

500
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,708
[gasps]

501
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,125
So, you gonna pick?

502
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,833
[HOTARU groans]
Yes! Of course.

503
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,083
This one looks good.

504
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,416
[HOTARU] Kokonotsu was going
to pick this piece earlier,

505
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,875
and he's luckier than me,
so it should be fine. I hope.

506
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,416
Alrighty then.

507
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,875
Got mine.

508
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,083
Okay. I guess I get what's left.

509
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,000
Are you guys ready?

510
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,000
Good luck.

511
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,416
--[KOKONOTSU] Yes!
--[TO] Mm-hm!

512
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,333
To the sour grape!

513
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,541
[BOTH]
To the sour grape!

514
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Mm! Oh, thank God!

515
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,750
Mine tastes super sweet!

516
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,750
[TO] Mm-hm! Yeah,
my piece is sweet too!

517
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,583
Guess who got the sour grape?

518
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,833
I don't know what
you're talking about.

519
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,041
Check out the look on your face!

520
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,916
I dunno man, that gum looks
pretty sour, if you ask me.

521
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,166
[HOTARU whimpers] Of course I
would lose again, like always.

522
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,958
Behold the taste.
The taste of defeat.

523
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,916
[TO]
Tastes sour, huh?

524
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,458
Really?

525
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,000
Cheer up, Hotaru.

526
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,791
There are worse things in life
than being bad at gambling.

527
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,083
I mean, you're awesome
at so many other things

528
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,083
and you know a lot about food.

529
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,958
That's sweet of you,
but it's just no use.

530
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:03,833
Bye.

531
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,500
Guess I'll see you guys later.

532
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh, see ya.

533
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,458
Hey wait.

534
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,083
Didn't she say that if she lost,

535
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,333
she'd do whatever
I asked her to do?

536
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,875
[HOTARU yelps]

537
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,916
[HOTARU]
Fly you fool!

538
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,041
[HOTARU] Wow, Baby-Star
Ramen is pretty famous, huh?

539
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,583
[SAYA]
For sure!

540
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,916
[HOTARU] And, just like Yo said
on his online video channel,

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,541
this <i>dagashi</i> was originally
called "Baby ramen!"

542
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,291
[SAYA] Doesn't it also
mean something like,

543
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,000
"small pieces of
ramen for kids"?

544
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,458
[HOTARU] Whoa, how'd you
know that, master?

545
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,750
[SAYA] Oh. Well, Coconuts
seemed so passionate about it,

546
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,083
so I decided to,
uh, look it up.

547
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,125
[HOTARU gasps]
I'm so proud!

548
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,708
We definitely want to spread
the good word about Baby-Star!

549
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,666
[SAYA]
Yeah!

550
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,833
[HOTARU]
And so...

551
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,083
[BOTH] Make sure you
check it out online!
