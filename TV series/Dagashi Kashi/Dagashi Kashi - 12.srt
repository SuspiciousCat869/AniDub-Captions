00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,541
Oh!

164
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,791
You're talking about the poem

165
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,375
that was written on the
back of this package!

166
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,125
[SAYA] I see! So that's
where it came from!

167
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,583
It sure did and talk
about sap-tacular!

168
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,500
Even I couldn't write
something like that!

169
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,708
[gasps]

170
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,875
Oh, right! Yeah, it's
so dumb! Ridiculous.

171
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,750
[HOTARU]
But still...

172
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,458
I kind of like this
poem. It's nice.

173
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:51,333
Yeah, it sure is.

174
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,833
Strange though,

175
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,666
why do you think they chose
a cherry to represent love?

176
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,208
Maybe love is
sometimes bittersweet?

177
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,750
Well that's what I think anyway.

178
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,083
Works for me!

179
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,541
[HOTARU]
Bittersweet, huh?

180
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,583
[SAYA]
Uh?

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,375
[gasps]

182
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,000
[SAYA]
No, it can't be!

183
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,500
Does Hotaru have a crush
on Coconuts after all?!

184
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,458
Hey.

185
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah? What's up?

186
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,625
Have you ever... had a
bittersweet run in with love?

187
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,625
Do you know what it's like?

188
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,708
What?! Well I kind of have.

189
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,291
But I also haven't.
If that makes any sense.

190
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:43,583
[HOTARU giggling]

191
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh my Pocchi.

192
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,958
Huh?

193
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,000
[SAYA grumbles]

194
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,416
Hotaru.

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,416
I get the feeling we're
not on the same page here.

196
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,875
[SAYA]
Hm?

197

What's wrong, Coconuts?

198

Hey, uh, To?

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah?

201
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,000
Could I ask you something?

202
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,416
Yeah?

203
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,958
It's about Hotaru.
Am I tying her up?

204
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,958
What?! Tying her up?!

205

[KOKONOTSU]
Okay. It happened yesterday.

215
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,125
Something wrong?

216
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Well,

217
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,500
am I the reason you haven't
been able to take those trips?

218
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,916
Is it maybe because
you've been busy

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,708
coming to our shop every day?

220
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,083
Gee, I hadn't really
given it much thought.

221
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,500
[KOKONOTSU] Then, get this,
she said it was because

222
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,000
I hadn't made up my mind about
taking over the shop yet.

223
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,250
Come on! Don't worry!

224
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,166
Honestly, when you said
you were tying her up,

225
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,125
I thought you meant
something dirty.

226
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,708
Am I right, Saya?

227
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,291
What?! Of course
I didn't think that!

228
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,625
[TO]
Whatever!

229
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,541
Do you want me to freakin'
cut you?! 'Cause I will.

230
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:20,083
'Kay, sorry. Anyway,
back to you.

231
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,583
Let me see if I can
understand your problem.

232
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,833
You're worried that because you
haven't made up your mind,

233
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,125
Hotaru can't be free
to do what she wants.

234
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:27,958
I guess.

235
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,500
You're way overthinking it.

236
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
[KOKONOTSU]
I dunno.

237
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,541
It's like,

238
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,875
I keep thinking about how my
dad makes me watch the shop,

239
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,375
and because of that I can't
do my own thing, y'know?

240
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,083
So you empathize with her?

241
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

242
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,541
[SAYA] But you know what?
Hotaru is strong.

243
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,875
She's not the type of person

244
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,125
to let someone keep her
from chasing her dreams.

245
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,500
And she's a free spirit.

246
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,833
I can't imagine that anyone
could take that away.

247
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,125
That's true.

248
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,416
You're a super big help, Saya.

249
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,125
And thanks for the fresh coffee.

250
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,583
No problem.

251
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:10,958
I promise to wait patiently.
Take your time.

252
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,833
[TO] Look, bro, if you're
that worried about it,

253
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,041
why not just ask her yourself?

254
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,833
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

255
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,000
Be honest with her! It's faster
to just go ahead and ask.

256
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,666
[door opens]

257
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,750
[TO]
Hm?

258
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,500
Whoa! Speak of the
devil! Great timing!

259
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,708
Now's your chance, Coconuts!

260
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,208
Yeah.

261
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,875
Um, hey, Hotaru!

262
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,333
Table for one. Smoking please.

263

[gasps]

264
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,541
I'm confused. Did she
take up smoking or what?

265
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Mm...

266
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
I'm not really sure,

267
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,708
but why else would she ask
to sit in the smoking section?

268
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,750
[gasps]

269
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,750
[BOTH gasp]

270
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,833
[KOKONOTSU]
Whoa, hold up!

271
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,583
That's Morinaga Milk Caramel!

272
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't get it.

273
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,458
Why would she eat a milk
caramel in the smoking section?

274
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh...

275
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,791
[gasps]

276
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,541
Wait, I just
remembered something!

277
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,583
It was an anti-smoking
advertisement.

278
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,416
They used to pitch milk caramel
as an alternative to cigarettes.

279
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,625
What?! For real?!

280
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,083
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah!

281
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,291
In fact, it was originally
marketed just for adults.

282
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,500
Why? Is it because
it was expensive?

283
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,250
That could be a big part of it.

284
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,708
In the Meiji era,
it was kinda pricy.

285
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,291
For instance, one <i>daifuku</i>
and a piece of milk caramel

286
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,791
cost the exact same amount.

287
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,208
Wow.

288
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,375
But there's more!

289
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,833
This is what makes
milk caramel so special.

290
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,208
You see, back then,

291
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,333
Japanese people weren't that
used to dairy products.

292
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,958
Well, at first, the milk
caramels didn't sell very well

293
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,333
because a lot of
people complained

294
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,333
that it smelled kinda like milk.

295
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,875
Ohh. I get it, so they changed
up their marketing technique,

296
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,708
and called it a
cigarette alternative.

297
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Right.

298
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,833
It had fans though,

299
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,583
even before the anti-smoking
marketing change.

300
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,208
Guess who the
biggest fan was.

323
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,291
[chuckles]

324
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,000
That's it!

325
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,791
It's all about flavor!

326
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,541
Milk caramels come
in many flavors.

327
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,375
Including <i>nanko ume</i> , <i>azuki</i>
bean, and <i>matcha</i> flavors!

328
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,000
And I saved the best for last.
The flavor that's my nickname!

329
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,041
It's the coconut's milk
flavored caramel!

330
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,375
Is that all?

331
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,541
Uh...

332
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,083
Not bad, I guess.
It will suffice for now.

333
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,750
That was bizarre.

334
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,791
Uh-huh.

335
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,833
Hey wait, aren't
you gonna stop her?

336
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:38,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

337
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,708
You needed to talk
to her, didn't you?

338
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,625
Ah! Crap, you're right!

339
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,666
[BOTH gasp]

340
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,208
Geez, close call.
It's comin' down hard.

341
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,250
[KOKONOTSU] I wonder where
Hotaru went. She's super fast.

342
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Hey, Hotaru!

343
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,458
Oh, hi! What are
you doing out here?

344
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,666
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

345
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,666
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

346
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,833
Honestly, the rain doesn't
bother me that much.

347
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,208
I just really wanted to eat,

348
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,541
but it's hard to walk
and eat sometimes.

349
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

350
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,208
What were you eating?

351
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,541
[HOTARU]
Ta-dah!

352
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Ah. Good ol' Sakuma Drops.

353
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,916
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But its normal packaging
isn't very convenient

355
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,708
for traveling and
eating, y'know?

356
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,333
But this package,
it's much more resilient.

357
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,916
Great for traveling,
but difficult to access.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm...

359
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,541
[HOTARU] With this lid I don't
have to worry about the rain.

360
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,416
Great job, Sakuma Drops.
Way to be tough!

361
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,166
[KOKONOTSU]
It's resilient all right.

362
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,458
It's even keeping Hotaru out.

363
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,083
Hey, um, can I see the Sakuma
drops for just a second?

364
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,458
[HOTARU]
Huh?

365
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,458
For those types of lids,
any coin will do the trick.

366
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,500
See?

367
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,291
[HOTARU]
What?!

368
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,083
This whole time I could
have been opening it

369
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,416
with just a coin?!

370
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,583
This is witchcraft I tell you!

371
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,916
There's no magic involved.

372
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,125
Anyway, how have
you been opening it?

373
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,666
Willpower!

374
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
For real?

375
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,750
[HOTARU yells]

376
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,416
[HOTARU] Yeah! It works
surprisingly well.

377
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,583
[HOTARU chuckles]

378
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,208
Actually, sometimes
it didn't work at all.

379
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Shocking.

380
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,625
Here!

381
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Oh, thank you!

382
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,416
[KOKONOTSU]
Ew, mint.

383
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,000
[KOKONOTSU yelps]

384
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,333
[HOTARU] What were you planning
on doing with that drop?

385
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,750
Hey! Let go of me!

386
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,541
You were going to
put the candy back,

387
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,791
and then you planned on
picking a different one!

388
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,250
[KOKONOTSU gasping]

389
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,666
You can't do that!

390
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,750
It doesn't matter if
you don't like it

391
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,625
It's taboo to put it back!

392
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,833
Even if it's you, Kokonotsu.

393
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,333
There're simply no exceptions!

394
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,125
Fine, okay.

395
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,166
The mint is actually
pretty tasty.

396
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,291
Told you so!

397
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,000
And you thought you
wouldn't like it.

398
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,125
A lot of people judge it
before they even try it,

399
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,958
but I wonder why they do that.

400
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,541
It's pretty good!

401
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,458
It even has its own candy pack
where they're all mint flavored.

402
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:50,750
You should always try new
foods. You might like 'em!

403
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,541
[gasps]

404
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,125
Oh yeah. Hey, Hotaru?

405
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,291
I was looking for you 'cause
I wanted to talk with you.

406
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,666
Well, talk away.

407
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,750
Yesterday on the train you said

408
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,875
that you would wait patiently
for me to make my decision.

409
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,458
But still, I feel like
maybe I should hurry up

410
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,041
and try to make that decision.

411
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,416
Why do you think that?

412
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,583
Because if I don't
make up my mind soon,

413
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,791
you'll have to stay here
and keep coming to our shop.

414
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,625
I want you to be able to
travel whenever you want.

415
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,666
Staying here, it's only
going to hinder your dream

416
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,250
to be the world's number
one snack manufacturer.

417
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,541
That's not fair to you.

418
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,250
Also, yesterday you said you
wanted to tour snack shops.

419
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,291
[HOTARU]
Kokonotsu?

420
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,791
Uh, yeah?

421
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,041
Look, you're way off
the mark on this one.

422
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,500
[KOKONOTSU]
What?

423
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,916
[HOTARU] If I really want to
travel again, then I will.

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,958
Hey, come on! We'll go on
a trip together right now!

425
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,333
That's a little too spontaneous.

426
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,666
And regardless...

427
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

428
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,750
[HOTARU] Building the world's
number one snack manufacturer?

429
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,958
It's not a dream, it's reality.

430
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,500
[gasps]

431
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,583
[HOTARU] Also, yes, I go
to the shop every day.

432
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,958
And yes, I'm trying to convince
you to take over for your dad.

433
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,500
Most importantly though,

434
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,000
I just go to have fun, and
hang out with our friends.

435
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,250
[HOTARU chuckles]

436
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,541
[HOTARU]
But thank you so much.

437
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,833
I appreciate your
consideration on the matter.

438
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,541
Ah, well, it's not a big deal.

439
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,791
[HOTARU]
It's like the lid container.

440
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,125
What's that?

441
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,416
[HOTARU]
I told you.

442
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,666
There are times I can't
open it with willpower.

443
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,166
Okay, so?

444
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,500
But we opened it
with a coin instead.

445
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,875
[HOTARU]
That's your answer.

446
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,000
Huh? Hold up.

447
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,833
You're not makin'
any sense again.

448
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,916
[gasps]

449
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,291
[chuckles]

450
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,541
It's nice out, and so pretty!

451
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,250
[gasps] Uh, yeah.

452
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,041
Shall we go?

453
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,625
Okay!

454
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,791
[HOTARU]
Come to think of it,

455
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,041
I don't think I've ever seen
a bus come to that stop.

456
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,250
[KOKONOTSU]
Don't worry, it'll show up.

457
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,958
Eventually, anyway.

458
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,250
Oh really?

459
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,666
[KOKONOTSU] Guess you'll
have to wait and see!

460
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,875
[HOTARU laughing]
