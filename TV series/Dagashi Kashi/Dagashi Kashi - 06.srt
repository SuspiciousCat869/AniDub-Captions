I was doing just now.

Well, not out loud.

00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,166
[HOTARU]
Okay then, I'll tell you.

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,250
Because you asked me nicely.

17
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,208
Hey, master?

18
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,416
[SAYA]
Um, yeah?

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,291
Since the beginning of time,

20
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,500
Japan has proudly been home
to over eight million gods.

21
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,708
Can you believe it?

22
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,583
Uh. Yeah, I guess?

23
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,166
Do you know where this is going?

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,208
No.

25
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,791
[HOTARU]
The gods can live anywhere,

26
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,916
like in the sun,
trees, or mountains.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,708
There are even gods who
inhabit pots and pans!

28
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,291
Which has to mean,

29
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,083
there's totally a
god of <i>dagashi!</i>

30

I believe it in my soul!

31

So to pay tribute, I am
offering up a dance.

32

A <i>dagashi</i> dance.

33
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,125
[grunts]
Of appreciation!

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,708

Anyway, random subject change.

00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,750
Let me ask you this,
when you guys were little kids,

38
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,375
did you ever get
in trouble for, like,

39
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,291
playing with your
food and stuff?

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,208
Yeah.

41
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,125
Sure.

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,000
Right!

43
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,666
Parents just don't understand.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,291
What's wrong with a little
<i>Kuru Kuru Bou</i> sword fighting?

45
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,041
Who doesn't want a necklace
made from <i>Fue Ramune?</i>

46
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,583
So what if you stuff
your face with <i>Watapachi</i>

47
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,125
and drink soda until you burst?

48
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,250
Who cares?

49
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,208
No wonder you got in trouble.

50
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,208
Well, don't worry, 'cause,
I know a fun <i>dagashi</i>

51
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,875
which practically begs
you to play with it!

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,166
And that snack is!

53

[HOTARU yelps, groans]

55
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,666
[TO]
They're these gummy candies,

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,833
which are shaped like rock,
paper, or scissors.

57
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,000
Remember when we used
to play with these?

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,708
Oh yeah, good times!

59
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,500
[HOTARU]
Wait a second.

60
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,791
[KOKONOTSU, TO]
Hm?

61
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,625
Wouldn't it be hard
to play with those?

62
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,625
I mean, you have to collect all
three shapes, choose one to play

63
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,958
and then go through the trouble
of taking it out of the bag.

64
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,666
You think so?

65
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,541
Of course. I don't think
it's meant for playing.

66
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,958
It's way too complicated
for all that.

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,666
Well, darn.

68
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,166
Oh, I got paper.

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,791
Even though the package
is showing scissors!

70
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,625
Hey, you know what?

71
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
It reminds me of that toy.

72
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,083
What toy?

73
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,166
Remember?

74
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,708
It was shaped like a hand.

75
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,333
I think it was all rubbery and
you could stick it to stuff.

00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,375
What about it makes it
okay to play with?

102
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,875
Good question, Master!

103
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,000
By the way.

104
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,083
Your pigtails make
you look adorable!

Really?

106
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,041
Super Himo Q's
advertising slogan is,

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,250
"It's fun to play with
and it tastes great, too!"

108
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,375
Catchy, right?

109
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,916
In a nutshell,

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,791
the company actually encourages
you to play with your food!

111
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,291
We have to play!

112
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,000
It's the sole reason for
this candy's existence!

113
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,791
You can do so much with it!

114
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,708
Like practice braiding,
maybe tying knots.

115
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,291
Or jumping rope!

116
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,291
But, you have to jump in a way
so that the Himo Q doesn't touch

117
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,333
either the ground or your feet,
because then you can't eat it!

118
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,500
You can even construct
chain mail armor!

119
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,916
How cool is that?

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,875
"Cool" is not the
word I would use.

Let's put our heads together.

122

to play with Super Himo Q.

I've already got a great idea!

Okay, next.

130

I'll cross the

Uh, yeah!

133
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,875
[HOTARU]
Now take this side.

134
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,750
So what's the point
of this game, exactly?

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,291
We'll both pull on the string
and if your string breaks first,

136
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,416
you have to take
over Shikada Dagashi!

any ideas, master?

[SAYA]
Hmm. Yeah, I might have one.

148
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,958
Tie the ends together to
make a circle, then do this.

just like Tokyo Tower!

else though.

00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,000
swinging the Himo Q around
like a pair of nun chucks!

164
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,458
In those days.

165
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,250
there were three pieces of
Himo Q in each bag of candy.

166
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,791
She ignored me.

167
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,750
[HOTARU] So even then, if you
were to tie them together,

168
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,875
it would just be 90 centimeters.

169
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,708
Currently it's 126 centimeters.

170
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,916
Hey!

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,625
You should probably stop
swinging it so hard!

172
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,291
We're so very lucky.

173
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,291
We get to live in a world
with longer Himo Q!

174
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,625

about to snap.

[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah.

How strange, my body

No surprise there!

Huh! <i>Ohajiki?</i>

[HOTARU]
And so...

202
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,250
[HOTARU] <i>Dagashi</i> shops
commonly carry toys and games.

This toy's special.

It has a lengthy history and
most stores still carry it.

I mean, what if you're not good?

220

It's okay, Coconuts.

224
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,583
[HOTARU]
You know what? In a sense,

225
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,916
this game was kinda like
the start of trading cards

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
and stuff.

227
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,916
I guess so.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,458
[HOTARU]
It's just one of those things

[TO]
Aw, out of bounds.

Yes, the winners take all,

like you're up, To!

Okay!

[SAYA]
Yeah.

241
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,083
That rule is called <i>"shikiri".</i>

242
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,583
It's for checking the distance
between <i>ohajiki</i> pieces.

243
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,625
If the pinky doesn't fit,
then you're not allowed to hit!

The pinky rule
also applies here.

251
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,583
See, if your pinky
doesn't fit in the gap,

252
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,583
it means you didn't hit
your piece hard enough

it, whenever we play a new game,

[HOTARU]
Hm. I can't believe this.

283

left me no choice.

Huh?

286
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,875
No way, it's a

What's that?

289
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,000
A bag of normal <i>ohajiki</i> costs
around a hundred yen.

290
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,333
But that costs just
as much all by itself.

00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,166
and it melts in
your mouth, yummy!

322
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,500
It's sorta like <i>Ramune.</i>
It's sorta like a candy.

323
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,458
Isn't Yoguret amazing?

324
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,958
You and your <i>dagashi.</i>

325
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,000
This is cooler
than other <i>dagashi.</i>

326
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,333
Plus, it's way different
from the other snacks!

327
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,666
Look on the back!
Do you see where it says

328
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,208
"Food with Nutrient Function
Claims" on the box?

329
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,000
Um, yeah? So?

330
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Yoguret contains calcium,

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,541
which helps you grow strong!

332
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,916
The calcium is crucial to
forming your bones and teeth.

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
And it has bifidobacteria,

334
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,541
which helps with
pooping and stuff!

335
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,916
Basically, it's a tasty <i>dagashi</i>
that's good for you, too!

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,291
Yoguret is
super-duper remarkable!

337
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,791
Think about it,

338
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,666
kids are always begging their
moms and dads for sweets.

339
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,041
But because parents want their
kids to eat healthy stuff,

340
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,625
they might not buy
them candy very often.

341
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,833
And then Yoguret
comes in and is all,

342
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,000
"Hey mom! I'm a healthy snack!"

343
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, we can get this one!

344
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,750
Yay! You're the best, mom!
Thank you!

345
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,166
The inventors are so smart.
They made a truly awesome candy!

346
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,458
[SAYA] Wow, you really
know a lot about dagashi,

347
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,291
huh Coconuts?

348
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,083
Well, I know a little bit.

349
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,291
Oh!

350
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,958
Hey, if you thought
that was cool,

351
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,583
check out what the inside
packaging looks like!

352
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,750
[SAYA]
Hm? That's strange.

353
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
It looks like medicine.

354
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,375
Yep!

355
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,791
You're on point
as usual, good job!

356
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,458
Wanna know why it's like that?

357
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,333
The manufacturer of Yoguret
makes medicine as well,

358
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,208
And they use the same packaging
supplies for their snacks.

359
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,666
[SAYA]
Oh...

360
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,708
It's so much fun to pop the
candy out of the package!

361
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,291
[KOKONOTSU] Hm! It kinda makes
you feel like you're a grown up.

362
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,583
Everything about this candy
is just so cool, y'know?

363
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,208
[gasps]
Hey, know what?

364
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,166
This would be good for playing
something like doctor,

365
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,083
wouldn't it?

366
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,291
[SAYA]
What?!

367
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,333
Did... you say playing doctor?

368
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,000
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

369
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:13,083
Well, now, we are gonna
be fourth graders soon.

370
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,833
Honestly we're too
old for that game.

371
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,166
It's not like I
really wanna play,

372
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,458
but if you have your heart set
on such a silly game, we can.

373
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh, no problem.

374
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,833
We can always
play something else.

375
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,666
[SAYA] Okay fine, we'll
play the dumb game,

376
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
stop pressuring me already!

What the heck?

00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,083

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,791
Will you please examine me?

[KOKONOTSU chuckles]

385

What's wrong, young man?

386
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,208
My head feels kinda hot.

387

Well then, we should definitely
check your temperature,

but we don't have a thermometer.

Huh?

390
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,416
You might have a fever.

Or maybe not.

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,166
Do I?

Wait a minute. Why do I
have to be the doctor?

some medicine then!

481
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,083
Boys are stupid.

482
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,208
Well, maybe it's not a bad
thing if he did forget all that.

483
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,083
Sometimes I really wish
I could forget it!

484
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,083
[SAYA]
Hi guys!

485
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,250
Oh ho, look who it is!

486
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,250
What's up? Need something?

487
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,833
Kind of.

488
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,875
So, um. I was wondering.

489
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,666
It's about what you
said at the shrine.

490
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,125
[HOTARU]
I'm so glad you stopped by!

491
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,833
What?

492
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,166
You're just in time, wait until
you see today's awesome <i>dagashi!</i>

493
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,000
I think you'll
totally like this one!

494
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,166
What kind of <i>dagashi?</i>

495
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,583
It's so cool!

496
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,750
This snack has, "Food with
Nutrient Function Claims"

497
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,458
right on the box!

498
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,041
It's Yoguret!

499
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,750
[KOKONOTSU, SAYA gasp]

500
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,000
Huh? Master Saya's
face is all red.

501
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,291
[KOKONOTSU whimpers]

502
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,125
[SAYA grunts]

503
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Wow! I just remembered
I have to wash my hair!

504
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,666
[SAYA panting]

505
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,500
[SAYA] Well, I guess
he does remember it.

506
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,166
[HOTARU]
Master Saya!

507
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,250
Why do you think
Maken Gumi exists?

508
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,958
[SAYA] I don't really wanna talk
about that stupid candy, Hotaru.

509
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,041
[HOTARU gasps]
Right! I'm sorry!

510
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,875
You know, I never expected
to see stars at the shrine.

511
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,333
[SAYA]
What? Stars?

512
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,833
Oh, do you mean the
star gummy in Maken Gumi?

513
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,416
[HOTARU]
Uh, not exactly.

514
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,916
[SAYA]
Well then, what do you mean?

515
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,250
[HOTARU] I was surprised
that it was stars

516
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,083
instead of like
strawberries or hearts!

517
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,625
But stars are really cute too!

518
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,000
[SAYA] Wait, strawberries and
hearts were popular designs

519
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,208
on girls' underwear.

520
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,083
