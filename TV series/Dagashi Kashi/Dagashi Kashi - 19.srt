very much <i>dagashi</i>
in your lifetime?

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,916
Uh. I guess not.

163
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,458
But I-- I was just kidding!

164
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,333
In fact, I saw one I love!

165
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,333
Here, found it! I used
to buy this all the time!

166
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,541
Kyoro- <i>chan</i> !

167
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,291
Ah, yes, Chocoball!

168
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,708
Like its name suggests, it's a
ball-shaped chocolate snack.

169
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,583
It's one of the biggest
players in <i>dagashi</i> !

170
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,750
A huge selling point is its
variety of flavors,

171
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,500
including caramel, strawberry,
and of course, peanut!

172
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,041
Ah! To think this is the
one that caught your eye.

173
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:46,875
I'm so impressed!

175

[HAJIME]
Yay!

176
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,625
Ah. But you know what
I loved most about it?

177
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
Better than the snack was
the can of toys you'd get

178
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,166
for sending in a gold ticket
or five silver tickets.

179
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,333
Uh-huh.

180
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,791
You liked the toys
better than the snack?

Uh...

183
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,041
[HAJIME]
What am I saying?

184
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,125
A <i>dagashi</i> shop would
want its employees

185
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,791
to be more interested in snacks
than a can of dumb toys.

186
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,625
And yet, I didn't even
stop to consider

187
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,416
my employer's personal
feelings on the matter.

188
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,458
I'm so stupid!

189
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,583
I don't wanna get fired again!

Oh, my. You scared me!

Wait, four tickets?
That's amazing!

Know what?

197
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,791
I actually found a can
of Chocoball toys

198
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
at a thrift shop once.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,666
Like for sale.

201

[HAJIME] I remember 'cause I
had a job interview that day.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
I wanted it so badly,

203
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,291
but it kind of felt like
cheating to buy it.

204
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,291
Did you?

205
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,541
[HAJIME] I debated about it
all day, but never bought it.

206
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,833
And on top of that,
I missed the job interview.

207
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,916
So you didn't get either?

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,458
Nah!

209
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,083
Which sucks 'cause I totally
missed out on the can of toys.

210
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,291
[KOKONOTSU]
For real?

211
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,583
Don't you think the job
was more important?

212

[HAJIME chuckles]

213
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,416
But hey, it all worked
out in the end

214
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,625
because now I get
to work here instead.

215
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,333
So it had a happy ending.

216
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,375
Well, as long as
you're happy, I guess.

Oh, I bet you
didn't know this.

This guy is Kyoro, right?

219
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,000
It looks like a normal cartoon,
but despite the fact

220
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,208
that he's looking sideways,
you can see both his eyes.

221
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,333
Kinda like the flounder fish.

222
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,291
Anyway, in the art world,

223
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,791
this sort of design is
commonly known as cubism.

224
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,208
It's where you combine
things from various angles

225
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,458
into one picture.

226
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,333
It's a technique
started by Picasso.

227
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,291
Isn't that such a fun fact?
