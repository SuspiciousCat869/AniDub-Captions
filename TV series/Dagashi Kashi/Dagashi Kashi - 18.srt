00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:39,791
Look, man, I appreciate it,
but to be honest with you,

161
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,166
I've gotta focus on running
my family's <i>dagashi</i> shop.

162
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
The pay is 850 yen.

163
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,875
[chokes] Say what now?

164
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,125
A very generous wage,
wouldn't you agree?

165
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,458
Well, that's not
really the issue.

166
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,875
Oh, not a money man,
huh? Okay, then.

167
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,958
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

168
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,958
Perhaps... you're into
the dirty stuff?

169
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,875
Convenience stores carry
a variety of magazines,

170
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,041
but of course, buying them
outright can be rather risky.

171
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,208
Exactly what are you getting at?

172
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,583
[BENIYUTAKA]
If you were to come work for us,

173
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:24,416
then you can buy these
without anyone seeing you.

174
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,250
[KOKONOTSU]
I could... buy them?

175
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,375
[BENIYUTAKA]
Of course,

176
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,458
that's just one of
the perks of the job.

177
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,666
Go ahead, take them.

178
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,916
But know that once you do,

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,250
you've agreed to be a
part of our little team.

180
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,333
Now, make your decision.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,083
[KOKONOTSU]
Man, what should I do?

182
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Hotaru.

183
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,166
The pleasures I'm looking
for aren't in these pages.

184
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,750
What I want, I'm going to
grab with my own two hands.

185
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,250
[BENIYUTAKA]
Hm. I understand.

186
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,833
Then I'll have to
use my last resort.

187
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,166
Wait, that wasn't it?

188
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,416
[BENIYUTAKA]
This is a job magazine

189
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,416
that has our store information.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,708
The whole team made it together
so that anyone who sees it

191
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,875
will want to visit our store.

192
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,541
It makes you want to
work for us, right?

193
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,791
[KOKONOTSU]
Whoa.

194
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,875
They used the world's
most superficial phrase.

195
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,458
[BENIYUTAKA] There was one girl
who was like shy or whatever,

196
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,458
but with time, I'm
sure she'll open up!

197
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,791
[BENIYUTAKA laughs]

198
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,375
[KOKONOTSU]
Actually, I don't blame her.

199
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,375
He's kind of a weird
guy to open up to.

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,208
[BENIYUTAKA]
So are you going work for us?

201
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,416
[KOKONOTSU]
No. Heh. Probably not.

202
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,458

203
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Next time:

204
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,875
"Hajime Owari,
Chocoball, and..."

205
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
Was hiring her
the right decision?
