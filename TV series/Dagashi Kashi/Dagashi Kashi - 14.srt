Morons.

158
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,208
What was all that?

159
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,833
Oh, it's just a
couple of bugs.

160
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,083
You don't say.

161
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,083
Anyway, you were talking
about playing something?

162
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,833
[HOTARU giggles]

163
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,416
[HOTARU]
When it comes to bathtub fun,

164
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,208
it's gotta be... this!

165
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,375
[SAYA]
A boat?

166
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,375
[HOTARU]
Yeah. A Pop Pop Boat.

167
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,666
Pop Pop Boat? How cute!

168
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,208
[HOTARU] It's more than a
typical toy boat, though.

169
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,541
Unlike other toy boats,

170
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,708
you don't simply
put it on the water.

171
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,375
The Pop Pop Boat
is steam powered!

172
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,291
[HOTARU] First, you put some
water in it using a straw.

173
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,708
Next, you light
this little candle.

174
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,458
Carefully place the candle
inside the boat.

175
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,166
Then you have to wait for
the water inside to boil.

176
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,375
And away it goes!

177
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,750
Oh!

178
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,208
And the name "Pop Pop Boat"
comes from the sounds it makes

179
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,375
while the water
inside is boiling.

180
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:12,250
Uh, what popping noise?
It's more like, "swish swish."

181
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
Maybe it comes from
something else, then?

182
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,291
So you weren't even sure?

183
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,083
[HOTARU]
Well, here's what I do know.

184
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,958
This actually wasn't
the original model

185
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,250
of the Pop Pop Boat, but it
was popular back in the day

186
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,083
because it's said to be
the first powered toy...

187
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,583
[SAYA]
Sometimes.

188
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,875
Hotaru has a unique way of
interacting with other people,

189
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,791
but I think she's kinda cool.

190
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,750
[phone rings]

191
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,958
[YO] Hey, Kokonotsu!
My phone's dead.

192
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Dad? Where are you?

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,291
Uh, well, currently...

194
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,291
[KOKONOTSU] Ah! Hotaru!
You can't walk around like that!

195
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,708
Say what?

196
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,416
[KOKONOTSU] No, Saya, the futon
is on the other side.

197
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
What the...?

198
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,625
[KOKONOTSU] I said to close that
door, To! What are you doing?

199
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,000
Sorry dad, I really gotta run.

200
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,291
[dial tone]

201
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,125
[YO]
Tamai!

202
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,666
Shut up! Do not come over!

203
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,666
[sighs] I'm not used to it being
so crowded. It's kinda crazy.

204
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,625
A Pop Pop Boat?

205
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,541
I remember when dad and
I used to play with these.

206
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,791
Huh?

207
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,791
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

208
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,708
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

209
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,750
[HOTARU]
Kokonotsu.

210
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,166
[gasps]

211
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,208
You can play with
it if you want.

212
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,750
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

213
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,541
[KOKONOTSU] Hotaru!
This bathroom is occupied!

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,375
[HOTARU] Next time.
"Beigoma, Reminiscence, and... "

215
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,083
Finally, a game I can't lose!
