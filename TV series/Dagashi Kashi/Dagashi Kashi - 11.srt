00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,750
[KOKONOTSU] Hey, Hotaru,
I was just wondering.

2
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,125
Remember when we first met?

3
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,708
Didn't you originally
come to our shop

4
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,708
because you wanted
to recruit my dad?

5
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,083
What? Is that for real?

6
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,708
[KOKONOTSU]
You seem kinda shocked, Saya.

7
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,583
Well, it reminded me
of when I met Hotaru.

8
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,041
"I was given orders by a
high ranking individual."

9
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,250
Or something kinda
weird like that.

10
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,541
"I journeyed to this land in
order to seek out the legend!

11
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,958
I overcame a great
many obstacles."

12
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,458
Yadda yadda yadda.

13
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,083
"And then I had to sign a
contract with a dragon," maybe?

14
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,625
"My destiny prevents me
from leaving this town.

15
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:23,541
Not until I have fulfilled my
obligation! I must succeed!"

16
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,666
At least I think
that's what you said.

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,833
Indeed!

18
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,583
What're you talking
about? What legend?

19
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,833
[SAYA]
Huh?!

20
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,416
So you mean this whole
time you were talking

21
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,833
about Coconuts' dad?!

22
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,375
Sure was!

23
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,083
My mission was to convince Yo
to work for us at Shidare.

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,583
But he would only agree to it

25
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,458
if I convinced Kokonotsu to
take over the family store.

26
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,208
I'm surprised you
didn't tell Saya that.

27
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,291
Why the look?

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,291
Well, isn't Shidare
supposed to be

29
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,750
like a pretty renowned company?

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,750
Of course, duh!

Okay, so tell me.

Why come all the way out to
the sticks to recruit someone?

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,458
[GIRL] I can't believe you
dragged me out here.

161
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,500
What? Aw, come on!

162
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,958
Whoa! She's high maintenance!

163
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
Huh? What's that?

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,250
Oh? Um, it's nothing.

165
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
Hey, don't be so down
on yourself, sport.

166
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,291
You know, some pieces
of Cola Gum are winners.

167
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,916
And if your piece
of gum is a winner,

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
then you get another
one free of charge!

169
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,041
Cool! I forgot about that!

170
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,625
Do you actually think
you're going to win?

171
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,958
You don't stand a chance.

172
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,458
[ONO]
Wait and see!

173
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,458
I'm feeling pretty lucky today!

174
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:40,875
[yelps]

175
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,250
[ONO]
My luck has forsaken me!

176
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,041
[YO]
Let's see what ya got!

177
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Wow! Look there! A winner!

178
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,708
Huh, for real?!

179
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,750
[YO] You really know how to
pick 'em, don't'cha champ?

180
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,291
You must be special to
win at a time like this!

181
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,000
You get another piece of gum!

182
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,500
[gasps]

183
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,541
[GIRL]
Ono, you're so cool!

184
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,666
You seriously picked
a winning piece?

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,291
[ONO]
Yeah, I guess.

186
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,875
[GIRL]
I'm sorry I doubted you.

187
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,041
[ONO]
You are?

188
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,875
[HOTARU] This is why the
world needs these shops.

189
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,750
Everyone deserves
to make memories

190
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,583
in a place like Shikada Dagashi.

191
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,458
Yo doesn't just sell snacks,

192
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,041
he brings people together, he
strengthens their connections.

193
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,291
That's a pretty
admirable quality.

194
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,500
It's not something
just anyone can do,

195
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,291
but it comes naturally for Yo.

196
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,208
Get it?

197
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,125
As a <i>dagashi</i> shop owner, your
father is beyond talented.

198
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,166
But what do you think?

199
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Uhh...

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,833
Well, to be honest, his business
sense is still pretty terrible,

201
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,208
but I can kinda see what
you're trying to say.

202
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,500
I dunno.

203
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,000
[KOKONOTSU sighs]

204
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,125
Oh yeah. Remember when
we were kids, Coconuts?

205
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Huh?

206
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,500
You were showing me Cola Gum.
It was sort of like today.

207
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,833
Gum?

208
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,541
Yeah, Cola Gum!

209
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,833
And they only cost ten yen each!

210
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,250
[SAYA]
Umm...

211
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,541
You only have enough money
to buy one piece, though.

212
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,125
[KOKONOTSU]
It's okay.

213
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,541
Because if your gum is a winner,
you get another one for free!

214
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,666
[SAYA]
Huh?

215
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,083
Let's see.

216
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,291
I'll pick this one!

217
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,625
Oh, please be a winner!
Please be a winner!

218
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,250
You kids sure are
serious about this gum.

219
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,791
[SAYA]
Wow, I won!

220
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,208
[YO]
Uh?!

221
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,041
[KOKONOTSU]
You're so lucky, Saya!

222
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,750
I almost never get a winner!.

223
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,500
Must be your lucky day.

224
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,041
Yeah! Must be!

225
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,583
So can I get another
piece? Pretty please?

226
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,833
Of course.

227
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,791
Amazing! That's two
winners in a row!

228
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,083
I'll have one more gum, please!

229
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,250
Sure, no problem.

230
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,000
[KOKONOTSU]
You won again!

231
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,750
Whoa, another winner!

232
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,375
Wow, you're really on a roll!

233
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,375
I know, and I'm
having so much fun!

234
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,291
[KOKONOTSU]
Mh-hm.

235
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,250
[SAYA]
Another please!

236
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,000
Come on, another?!

237
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,458
I bet he was just letting me
have winners to be nice,

238
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,083
like he was today with Ono.

239
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,875
Deep down, Mister Shikada
is a big teddy bear.

240
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,083
Yo's such an incredible person.

241
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,541
[KOKONOTSU]
Mmm...

242
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,416
I'm not convinced he was
letting you win, Saya.

243
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,250
What?! After everything
we've seen today,

244
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,791
you're still hating on him?

245
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,375
I'm not! How should I say this?

246
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,375
I know my dad isn't
always a perfect person.

247
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,166
But his heart is
in the right place.

248
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,500
Sometimes I just forget that.

249
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,125
We all make mistakes.

250
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,166
[YO]
Oh? What is this?

251
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,375
And what do we have here?

252
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,166
[gasps]

253
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Crap!

254
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,541
I can't believe he found
the manga I was working on!

255
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,708
What's up? Something wrong?

256
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,250
No, no, not at all!

257
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,000
Everything's fine!
Everything is just peachy!

258
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,583
Looks like Kokonotsu's manga.

259
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,666
He must've been working
on it up here earlier.

260
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
Teehee! I'm totally
gonna read his stuff

261
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,250
before he comes back
from his friends' house.

262
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,125
Uh?

263
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Don't you dare!

264
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,708
[YO yelps]

265
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,791
[chuckles] Oh, hey, son! Uh,
were you here this whole time?

266
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,083
--[KOKONOTSU growling]
--[YO laughing]

267
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,041
[KOKONOTSU] I told you...
Don't ever touch my stuff!

268
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,583
[HOTARU]
Where's the train?

269
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm kinda bored.

270
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,208
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

271
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess since one came not
long ago, it'll be a while.

272
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

273
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,416
[HOTARU] Even though we ran,
it still left without us.

274
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,583
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

275
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,291
And you're sure we'll
be here for a bit?

276
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

277
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,625
[HOTARU]
We just gonna sit here?

278
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

279
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,958
Okay then.

280
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,958
Guess I'll suck on it.

281
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,875
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep...

282
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,000
[gasps]

283
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,666
Wait a second...
What did you say?

284
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,458
I have to do something
fun until the train comes.

285
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,375
I'm way bored,
so I'll suck it instead.

286
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,416
[KOKONOTSU gasps]

287
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,875
[KOKONOTSU]
"Suck it instead"? Suck what?

288
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,250
[HOTARU]
Hm?

289
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,375
Ah! I see you wanna
suck on something too.

290
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,583
Don't worry, I'll let
you suck my stuff.

291
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,833
[KOKONOTSU]
What? You will?!

292
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,750
Sure, it's only fair!

293
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,333
Yeah, I guess.

294
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,625
[KOKONOTSU] Is this really
okay to do in a public place?

295
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,250
What if we get caught?

296
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
[HOTARU]
Ta-da!

297
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,958
We can suck on kombu <i>hamakaze.</i>

298
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:38,708
For real?

299
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,875
[HOTARU]
What?

300
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,041
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

301
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,708
Duh, of course it isn't!
Sorry, my mistake!

302
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,666
Whew! What a relief!

303
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,708
I thought you were talking
about something else!

304
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,541
[HOTARU]
Here. Miyako Kombu.

305
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,041
How silly of me.

306
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,708
You're probably more familiar
with this one, am I right?

307
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,041
[KOKONOTSU]
Yep.

308
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,416
[HOTARU]
And so...

309
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,333
[KOKONOTSU]
Damn it all.

310
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,000
When you wanna
suck on something,

311
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
Nakano's kombu is the best!

312
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,000
I've heard that Miyako
Kombu is considered

313
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,458
pretty popular as well!

314
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,125
[KOKONOTSU]
Yeah, whatever.

315
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,666
Sour!

316
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,500
Bet you didn't know this
about the kombu series,

317
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,833
but the history of it
dates back to 1926.

00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,291
Whoa. It's that old?

319
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,833
It is.

320
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,291
it started with Mister Nakano
the creator of Miyako Kombu.

321
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,750
He was working as a shop boy
at a wholesale kombu store.

322
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,458
They sold dried foods
and things like that.

323
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,916
[HOTARU]
Instead of eating snacks,

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,791
Nakano preferred to eat
the torn pieces of kombu

325
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,166
that the store couldn't
sell individually.

[NAKANO gasps]

Nobody wants to eat
us, we're useless!

328
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,708

them; it'll be delicious!

[KOMBU laughing]

333
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,041
[HOTARU]
After that,

334
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,375
Nakano began to visit places
where children would gather.

335
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,041
He sold them his new snack.

336
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,333
It would later be
named Miyako Kombu.

337
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,083
That's how the kombu we know
and love today was born.

338
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:09,791
Wow. But then, is it
really a <i>dagashi?</i>

339
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,708
We don't carry it at our store.

340
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,083
If it were a common snack,

341
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,666
then we would
definitely know about it.

342

Don't go making assumptions.

344
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,750
There's more to the story
that I haven't told you.

00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,000
[KOKONOTSU]
There's more?

346
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,875
[HOTARU] Nakano wanted
to expand his business,

347
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,125
so he asked himself

348
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,125
where do large groups
of people tend to gather

349
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,416
that would also
want to buy kombu?

350
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,583
Do you know the answer?

351
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,125
Uhh... Where do groups
of people gath--?

No fair!

354
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,958
[HOTARU
The answer is...

355
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,458
[KOKONOTSU]
Hm?

356
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,541
Right here!

357
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,833
[KOKONOTSU]
Right here?

358
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh! Train station gift shops!

359
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,833
Yep! That's right!

360
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,833
[KOKONOTSU]
But wait.

361
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,333
Huh?

362
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,833
[KOKONOTSU] This station doesn't
have a convenience store.

363
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,083
[HOTARU]
Correct again.

364
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,500
[KOKONOTSU]
Okay...

365
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,125
That's not the point I'm making.

366
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,958
It's that Miyako Kombu
is sold at train stations.

367
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,416
You don't usually see
at <i>dagashi</i> stores.

368
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,166
It's small enough
to conveniently fit

369
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,250
in a pocket or a woman's purse.

370
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,416
So kombu sells
better at the station.

371
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,041
Makes sense I guess.

372
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,750
I'm not usually
into sour snacks,

373
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,583
so I don't eat them that much.

374
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,458
But the yummy chewiness
of this kombu

375
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,000
makes it pretty darn addictive.

376
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,166
Ugh. Then again, it also makes
me really friggin' thirsty.

the lemonade Perry

Maybe it's just a hunch,

between cider and <i>Ramune</i> is?

The only difference is
that <i>Ramune</i> 's sealed

00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,791
Are you serious?

476
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,458
But... why'd you agree to come
without knowing the destination?

477
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,916
It just seemed like fun.

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,791
Well then, next time let's
tour snack shops together!

479
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,416
You'd like to go tour again?

480
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,291
Meaning you've taken
this trip before?

481
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,375
[HOTARU]
Yep!

482
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,625
Uh... Though now
that I think about it,

483
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,458
it's been a while since
I've sought out the roots

484
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,958
of any <i>dagashi.</i>

485
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,291
I didn't realize
that was a thing.

486
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,041
But it's true you have an
impressive knowledge of snacks.

487
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,416
You're kinda like a master.

488
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,666
[HOTARU]
No.

489
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,333
There's still a lot out
there I need to learn.

490
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,833
It's the only way
I'll ever be able

491
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,083
to build the world's number
one snack manufacturer.

492
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,958
Oh yeah, that's right. Uh?

493
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,333
Something wrong?

494
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,916
[KOKONOTSU]
Well...

495
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,666
...am I the reason you haven't
been able to take those trips?

496
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,125
Is it maybe because
you've been busy

497
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,958
coming to our shop every day?

498
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,000
Gee, I hadn't really
given it much thought.

499
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,375
When I first came to this town,

500
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,041
I wasn't originally planning
on staying for so long.

501
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:08,791
[HOTARU gasps]

502
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,333
Wait a sec!

503
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,583
Yeah, I'm still here because
you haven't made up your mind

504
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,416
about takin' over
the family shop yet!

505
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,625
[KOKONOTSU]
Sorry, but I do have my reasons!

506
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,750
I'm totally kidding!

507
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,666
[KOKONOTSU]
Uh?

508
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,125
But it is a serious matter.

509
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:21,916
Which is it?!

510
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
[HOTARU chuckles]

511
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,291
This may surprise you,

512
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,333
but I do understand that
you have your own dream

513
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,166
apart from your family's
store, Kokonotsu.

514
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,583
Know this.

515
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,125
I would never force you to
take over Shikada Dagashi.

516
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,916
What? Really?

517
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,250
[HOTARU] I'm looking forward
to seeing which dream

518
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,541
you will choose to pursue
when it's all said and done.

519
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,791
Till that day comes...

520
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,375
[whistle blowing]

521
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,916
...I promise to wait patiently,
so take your time.

522
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,375
Come back! Hotaru!

523
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,875
[KOKONOTSU] Where is she
going to wait for me?

524
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,916
[SAYA] Hey, what do
you think the chances

525
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,750
of getting a winning
piece of gum are?

526
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,208
[HOTARU]
I don't know,

527
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,666
but I guess it would have
to do with a person's luck.

528
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,333
But I never win, which
is completely unfair!

529
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,708
[SAYA]
Yeah.

530
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,625
[HOTARU] Ah! I wonder if
there's a secret technique!

531
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,791
[SAYA]
In picking a winner?

532
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,958
--[HOTARU] Yep!
--[SAYA gasps]

533
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,333
[HOTARU]
Did you get an idea?

534
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,416
[SAYA] Sort of, but it's
really only a way for people

535
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,000
other than you to find a winner.

536
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,583
[HOTARU]
Aw, why not me?

537
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,916
[SAYA]
Well...

538
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,375
...if someone were to pick
after you already tried,

539
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,541
then their chances of winning
would increase, right?

540
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,041
[HOTARU]
Uh! Master Saya! That's so mean!
