Sotoin said...

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center
...my dream was something...

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.352 position:50% align:center
...beautiful.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
Beautiful?

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.481 position:50% align:center
Really? Such a welcoming word
shouldn't share a sentence

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
with the core of my suffering.

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be an astronaut!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
My tormentor, my dream,

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
wasn't some toy to be
played with when bored.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
Except... that isn't
how I truly felt.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
It wasn't that I simply
looked down on my own dream.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
I was... repulsed by
the very thought of it.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I greeted the
morning of my 14th birthday

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:25.854 position:50% align:center
without the slightest sign
of the star I so hoped to find.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
It was the promised deadline.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.571 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
My time was up.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.990 position:50% align:center
All I know is that
it's much too soon for us

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.783 position:50% align:center
to give up our search!

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50% align:center
Precisely what
do you mean by that?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] The promise
you made with your parents

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50% align:center
doesn't take effect
until you turn 14.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
So what was the exact
time of your birth?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
Th-The time of my birth?!

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
I believe it was, uh,

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center
sometime around early evening?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Hold on!
You can't mean...?!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Indeed! I mean exactly that.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
In other words, our time's
been extended until evening,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
and we're using
every extra second!

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.979 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
Except, it's still light out
in the early evening,

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
so that added time will be
over long before it gets dark.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Perhaps you don't
understand my meaning,

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dogima.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
Even during the day,

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
you can readily
observe celestial bodies

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
such as the sun and the moon?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Yes, but that's
only the sun and the moon.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious, Nagahiro.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
You're not actually considering
that idiot's dumbass idea.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
--[MANABU] Hmm?
--Correction, Michiru.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
Although a stupid person

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50% align:center
may have actually
come up with the idea...

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
...it doesn't make
the idea itself stupid.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.051 position:50% align:center
Then tell us how it isn't dumb.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.221 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Well, to start, I
just came up with a new theory.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
There's something
I'd like to look into.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
Miss Dojima.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
If you could, please convince
your parents to go along

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
with our leader's proposal
when you return home.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
And would you grace us

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
with your presence in the
Art Room after school?

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we'll be
able to impart to you

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
some good news when we meet.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
Try not to let your hopes
get up too high, Dojima.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
You may think Nagahiro's
a decent and respectable person

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
compared to the
rest of us pretty boys,

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
but he's actually
engaged to a first grader

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
Lolita complex...

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
--[MAYUMI shrieks]
--[MANABU laughs]

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to freak out over.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
If you can forget
about him being a lolicon,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
Nagahiro is actually
a true gentleman.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Forget about it??

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:21.553 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.138 position:50% align:center
Even an amnesiac
would remember something

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
as deplorably creepy as that!

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
I'm not dating a first grader,
we're engaged.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
Our parents arranged
the entire thing

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.649 position:50% align:center
without our knowledge,
you know that, Leader.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.736 position:50% align:center
However...

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Hyota may have
been correct to tell you

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
not to get your hopes up.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Back home, I had no
trouble convincing my parents.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.330 position:50% align:center
They agreed to extend
our promised deadline

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
to sunset at the latest.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
I forgot my glasses...

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Huh, that's just great...

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Someone was there.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Whoever that was,
I need to hurry to school.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
But if I go too fast,

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
they'll know I saw them
and they'll chase me.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
[whistles nervously]

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Two more...

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
Plus the one
behind me makes three.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Who'd I piss off?!

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Aw, jeez...

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
Come on...

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
Keep going...

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
Just move!

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
Move!!

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?!

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
I don't understand,
and that's an understatement.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
What in the world is going on?!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
Hop on!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI gasps]
"Hyota the Adonis"...

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
His isn't a superficial
beauty, after all...

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
So, Dojima.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
How'd it go?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.644 position:50% align:center
Were your able to
convince strict parents?

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
At least, they agreed
to postpone.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Hm... Oh, I see.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
You're such a good girl, Dojima.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, "a good girl"?

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
You see, if it were me,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
there is no way I'd ever
even consider keeping

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
a promise like that.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.787 position:50% align:center
You probably don't know this,

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.373 position:50% align:center
but my parents got
divorced pretty recently.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
While it was happening,

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
I overheard some people
saying they felt bad for me

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
because my parents
were splitting up.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
But the only reason anyone
would think to say that is

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
if they look down on children
of single parents, right?

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
It'd make sense if they
said what a pain it was

00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
for the kid instead, you know?

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I didn't
want them to use me

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
as some sort of excuse

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.896 position:50% align:center
when making such
an important decision.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
So, Dojima, if you're gonna
give up on your dream,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.484 position:50% align:center
it has to be your choice.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.569 position:50% align:center
Or I'll feel bad
for your parents.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
Wait! More than feel bad...

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
"You'd be a pain."

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] That being said,
I still don't get it.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
For what reason
are your mom and dad

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
so dead set against your dream

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
of someday becoming
an astronaut?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
Could it have something to do

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
with why you get
so pissed off

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
when someone starts
talking about your eyes?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] That...
has nothing to do with it.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.140 position:50% align:center
Nothing at all.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
They're not related.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
Doin' okay, Mayumi?

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
Perfect.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
What's "perfect"
about a middle school kid

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
getting chased
around by some adults?

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
I-I'm all right. Really!
I mean, Hyota came to my rescue

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
and everything was fine.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Actually, they almost had us.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI groaning]

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
Brew me some tea.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty bold request,
coming from you.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.085 position:50% align:center
But whatever.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
Anyone else?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
Who's up for some tea?

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.841 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I just realized
their leader isn't here.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.592 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ah, yes.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
It's elementary, my dear,
that the leader is our Kogoro.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
He'll be here after school.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
He's your... Kogoro?

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
Correct. So you'll simply
have to make do with us

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
until after school adjourns.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] While waiting
for their leader's arrival,

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
I once again recounted
the events from that morning.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
I see...

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
As much as I had
hoped otherwise,

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
it would appear my apprehensive
hunch wasn't very far off.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Nagahiro.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
Are you saying you knew
that this would happen

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
But I never expected it
would escalate

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
to this point
as quickly as it has.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
I failed to notice
the dangers involved

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
until after I started
investigating.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
While Sosaku and I delved deeply

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
into researching events
that occurred ten years ago,

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
we came to discover
a shocking truth.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center
A shocking truth?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
Well, allow me to explain.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
Prepare yourself
for a harrowing tale.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Laaadies aaaand gentlemen!

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
Lend me your ears!

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
To search for a star.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
It was, as our leader said,
such a beautiful request.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
My boyish heart filled with joy

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
when I heard
we would take the case.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
To find a star to call your own,

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
one you could name yourself...

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
A star just for you,
and no one else!

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
Imagine being able to name it
after someone you loved.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.466 position:50% align:center
Could anything be more romantic?

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
And, no, this has nothing to do
with my first grader fiancée.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
Quiet Hyota!

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
The point which I'm trying
to get across is this:

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
The beautiful idea of
searching the heavens

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
for a unique star
transcends the ages

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
and is shared by
people across the globe.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
The universe is
under our collective,

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
constant surveillance.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
Despite humanity's gaze,

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
no one has seen our star
in the last ten years.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
Now what exactly does that mean?

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
It's true, Michiru.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
If we were to go with
the most obvious deduction,

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
we would say that
the star never existed.

00:10:23.498 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
That it was simply
the machinations

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:29.295 position:50% align:center
of four-year-old Miss Dojima's
active imagination.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
However, if our
leader were present,

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
he would reject
such a conclusion,

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
and say there's
nothing beautiful

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
about the deduction at all--
And rightfully so.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
Now, earlier I mentioned
that the universe

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
is under our
constant surveillance.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
But there is a fallacy
in this statement.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
There's a hint to it in what
our leader said this morning.

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
People tend to watch the stars
under the cover of night.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it's
untrue that the universe

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
is "constantly"
under surveillance,

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
as it's only
watched half of the time.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
And so, I came upon a
completely different theory.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
Specifically,
that it was a possibility

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
that Miss Dojima didn't see the
star sometime in the evening.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
But instead, in broad daylight.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
In broad daylight...

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's right.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
I was only
four years old, after all.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Kids that age aren't usually
allowed out when it's dark.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
What's your point?

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Even if it's daytime in Japan,

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
it's nighttime somewhere
else in the world.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that mean
every inch of space

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
gets observed at some point?

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Except that relies on what
you perceive as "space."

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
To put it simply,

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.241 position:50% align:center
if the star Miss Dojima
saw was not lightyears away,

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
but instead extremely
close to Earth,

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
it would be impossible
to observe it outside Japan

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
based on its altitude and angle.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
Also, in the same way the moon's
visible in broad daylight,

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.213 position:50% align:center
it's possible she saw
the star during the day

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
because it was so close by.

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I see...

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Ohhh... I get it!

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
It's like how
you can see meteors

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
even when the sun's out.

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
So! You think she
saw a meteor burning up

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
in the atmosphere
and mistook it for a star?

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Not exactly.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
If it were an object flying in

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50% align:center
from outer space
heading toward Japan,

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
it could still be seen worldwide
while on its trajectory.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
But you're right.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
At the point it burned up,

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
it would only be seen in Japan.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
Sakiguchi?

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your
thoughtfulness.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
But it's fine.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
You can stop
trying to sugarcoat it.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to accept the truth.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
If what I saw all those
years ago was an object

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
that was barely at the
altitude for outer space...

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
That means it wasn't something

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
someone would
classify as a star.

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
Or anything even close
to one, for that matter.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
In the end, I never saw
a star to begin with.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
What I saw wasn't
worth dreaming about.

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
It was nothing to strive for.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
There's one thing
I'm sure of now...

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
Somehow, I had made a mistake.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
A mistake that caused me
to waste ten years of my life.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
So no matter what conclusion
Sakiguchi has come to,

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
I know none of
this is his fault.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
He's not to blame.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
And neither is the
Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter what
truth they've discovered.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
As someone who's
been living a lie,

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
it's my responsibility
to accept whatever comes.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
Please, just tell me.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
I really need to know the truth.

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
What on Earth
did I see that day?

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Tell it to me straight.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
What you saw wasn't a star.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
It was a man-made satellite.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
[SOSAKU] And it wasn't just
any man-made satellite...

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
...but a military one.

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Imagine if you will,

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
that a privately-owned military
company secretly developed

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
and launched a military
satellite prototype.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
One that was carefully
camouflaged to avoid detection.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
And to avoid speculation,
they fabricated

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
a false objective
when they launched it...

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
But then...
the mission was aborted.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:05.845 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Aborted?

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Forcefully so.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
It was shot down.

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
And news of this
event, any of it,

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
has been hidden from public
knowledge since it happened.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI gasps]

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
Which means the star
I saw that day...

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
...wasn't some
celestial object,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
but the explosion from when
that satellite was shot down?

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
That is probably what occurred.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Hey, wait a sec.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make any sense,

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
there's no oxygen
in outer space.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
Didn't we learn
that in grade school!

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
And without oxygen,
things don't ignite,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
so there'd be no explosion...

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
So that's it.

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
Something you don't
learn in grade school.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
Even without oxygen,
even in outer space...

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
There is one form of
combustion that can happen

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
without such trivial factors.

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
Nuclear fusion.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
Shot down by a nuke...

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:53.518 position:50% align:center
That's something the
public can't know about.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] And as if
nothing had even happened,

00:14:55.687 --> 00:15:00.358 position:50% align:center
without anyone noticing, the
incident quietly came to an end.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
So what... happens now?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
Will I be kidnapped?

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.909 position:50% align:center
Erased?

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
We're all in this together.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
So try not to worry.

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
Because nothing's gonna happen.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
Right? Nagahiro?

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter
who we're up against.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's us
we're talking about.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.132 position:50% align:center
Yes. But of course.

00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
No matter the circumstance,

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
what the adults are
up to doesn't matter.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
Because, as you know,

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
we are boys.

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Look at these guys.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.186 position:50% align:center
What's up with them?

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
How can they be smiling
at a time like this?

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.318 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I'm... I'm happy.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
Happy that they've
actually got my back.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
Happy that they're
actually staying by my side.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Realistically speaking,

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
should I be
contacting the police?

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] There's no way
they'd take you seriously.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
What, you're gonna
tell them you watched

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
as a military satellite
got nuked ten years ago?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
Do you think anyone
in their right mind

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
would ever believe that?

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.973 position:50% align:center
It's not like you've
got evidence.

00:16:14.057 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] What's stopping us from
getting some evidence right now?

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
What if we were
able to get proof

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
that a buncha people were
chasing Dojima this morning?

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
I guess--

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
That's the reason we need
to capture one of them.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
If we could pull
something like that off,

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
we'd have all the proof
we could ever need right there.

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Y-Yeah...

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty dangerous plan.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:32.534 position:50% align:center
I'm certain they'll
be on the lookout

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
for anyone shadowing them...

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
There's also the possibility
that they'll be armed.

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.289 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Armed...

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Then just let me handle it.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
This is exactly the kinda crap
I'm here for, right?

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Uh...

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
No!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
You're here because of
your impeccable cooking skills

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
and delectable meals!

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
You can rest assured, boys.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
I have the perfect plan.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmmm...

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
So, the good kids will
make their way to class.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
And the bad kids will
proceed with the secret plan.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:05.400 position:50% align:center
Essentially the plan follows
the idea that Hyota suggested.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.527 position:50% align:center
We'll make your pursuers
lose track of you.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
And once they become
restless and panic,

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
that'll be our
opportunity to catch them.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Except they
probably already figured out

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
what school I go to...

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dojima.

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
Have you already forgotten
who you're talking to?

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Can't forget what I don't know.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Don't give me that look.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
We're the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy
Detective Club's third rule is:

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
Be a detective, of course.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
And what are the
best detectives known for?

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
How would I know?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
Just tell me.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
The best detectives, of course,

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
are known for their disguises!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
You're up, Sosaku!

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
Makeover time!

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.855 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I'm getting a makeover?

00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Talk about a makeover.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Th-This is...

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
...me?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] I thought you
hated beautiful people.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I do hate them!

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
I hate the person
I've been transformed into...

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
But it is a
life-or-death situation,

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
so I'll bear being
pretty for today.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hey, what is all this?!

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
It's horrible!

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
Uh. I don't understand,
what's so horrible?

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
You made her too pretty, Sosaku!

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
I keep telling you,
the fact that you're so skilled

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
is your greatest merit
and your only flaw!

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
It'd be fine if
you transformed her

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
into a quirky
pretty boy like us,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
but if this pristine pretty boy

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
was seen walking
home from school

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
without a girl on his arm,
people'd think it strange!

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.110 position:50% align:center
It'd draw too much attention.

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
I guess I have no choice.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Where a member's
excellence fails,

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
it's my job as leader
to make it succeed.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
And so I'll lend a hand.

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
It's time for me to act.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
Once more, Sosaku!

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
Work your magic!

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hey, Sotoin...

00:18:58.513 --> 00:18:59.889 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something?

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Only if
it's something beautiful.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Why are you
doing so much for me?

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it make more sense

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.356 position:50% align:center
for the Pretty Boy Detective
Club to wash their hands of me,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
all things considered?

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
Well, you know, the thought
never really crossed my mind.

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
But it would be a
wise way to tackle this.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be a
beautiful way, however.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
It would go against
my aestheticism.

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
Rest assured, Mayumi Dojima.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
We don't protect our
clients' confidentiality,

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
but we do protect our clients.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.378 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
This pretty boy's--

00:19:30.462 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
No, pretty girl's
thoughtful words

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
sent an indescribable
feeling coursing through me.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
I was embarrassed.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Downright miserable.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
They turned me into
something gorgeous,

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
a pretty boy tailored
to perfection.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
But beauty's only skin deep.

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
Inside, I'm still me.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
I guess that makes me
Cinderella, huh?

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm?

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
You know the story.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
Cinderella's fairy
godmother dresses her up,

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
the handsome prince falls
in love with her at the ball,

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
then searches high and low
for her using the glass slipper

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
she left behind as a clue.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
She was basically
a passive princess

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
who didn't do anything.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
I don't think Cinderella

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
did absolutely nothing.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:12.087 position:50% align:center
After enduring years of hardship
with her abusive stepmother,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
she very much deserved
a happy ending.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
It'd be wrong if
she wasn't rewarded.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
The same goes for you.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
All those endless nights
you spent watching the sky

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
were far from a waste of time.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
If not for that,
we never would have met,

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
and we won't
let it be for nothing.

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
You will definitely be rewarded.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Even if that star doesn't exist.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
By the way,
speaking of Cinderella,

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.154 position:50% align:center
people always tend to
wonder why the glass slippers

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
didn't disappear at
the stroke of midnight along

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
with her evening gown
and the pumpkin carriage.

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
All those things were
created using the same spell,

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
after all, so shouldn't
they disappear together?

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
But if you ask me, it's a
pretty ridiculous question.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
Obviously, everything
happened according

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
to the fairy godmother's
masterful design!

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
If just being dressed up,

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
if just riding in a carriage,

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
if just being given
a superficial makeover...

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
...were reward enough
for someone like Cinderella,

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
who's enduring spirit
led her to crash

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
that luxurious castle ball...

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
...then the fairy
godmother's magic

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
wouldn't have been
so wonderful, would it?

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Looks like
our perfectly pretend,

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.405 position:50% align:center
perfectly pretty
couple helped us

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
slip past our
pursuers unnoticed.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
Probably...

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
I just realized.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:29.039 position:50% align:center
You have quite the sixth sense
when it comes to this.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
You're usually able
to tell whether or not

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
you're being followed.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
I'd never notice myself.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well...

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.338 position:50% align:center
Girls are more sensitive
about things like that

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:37.672 position:50% align:center
compared to boys.

I guess that makes sense.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
But your powers of perception...

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:13.792 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
