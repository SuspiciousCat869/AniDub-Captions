00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.189 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Welcome to election
season at Yubiwa Academy.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
According to the current
approval ratings,

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.859 position:50% align:center
put out by the school newspaper,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
Yokuya is in first place.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.489 position:50% align:center
Just like Mr. Senpai predicted.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:56.157 position:50% align:center
How such an unremarkable student

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.617 position:50% align:center
managed to gather
so much support

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.620 position:50% align:center
from who-knows-where
is completely beyond me.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:03.665 position:50% align:center
Regardless, in an impartial
questionnaire that was issued,

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
a majority answered
that they would

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:09.254 position:50% align:center
"vote for Kinshiro Yokuya"
in the upcoming election.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, trailing behind
Yokuya, and in third place

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.300 position:50% align:center
on the aforementioned
approval questionnaire,

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
was yours truly.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50% align:center
But believe me I was putting
up one heck of a fight.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
This is amazing...

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.536 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] You know,
considering how not-run-over

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
I've been lately, I'm starting
to think it might have been

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.541 position:50% align:center
a little far-fetched
to assume that Naganawa

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
was run over in retaliation
for her candidacy...

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
I mean, thank goodness
her injuries

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
weren't serious that could
have killed her, you know?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
Does it really matter
how it happened?

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
Even if it was made
to look like an accident,

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
there must be other ways
you could go about it.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
If the "hit-and-run perpetrator
of Hill D" really exists,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
there's still no
explanation as to why

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.106 position:50% align:center
they chose a car as a weapon.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
Well, even if the administration
has an assassin on payroll,

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure it changes
anything if we expose them

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
because based on the numbers,
my chances of winning are slim.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow! Sorry! I'm sorry.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
I'm being negative, I know.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
Mayu.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.831 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:32.295 position:50% align:center
Mayu, you are ignoring that
which is right in front of you.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
If the reason a vehicle
was chosen as a weapon

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
is a mystery to you,
as a detective,

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
you must solve that mystery.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
Something unusual
always has a reason.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
Whether it's a car or...

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
...whether it's Kinshiro Yokuya.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
So If you're using
a car as a weapon,

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
is the only reason to
make it look like an accident?

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
We have no eyewitnesses,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
and we're not gonna find any,

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
not that we'd get a statement
to that effect if we did.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
And if Naganawa can't
remember anything herself,

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
then we're dead in the water.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
I mean, unless...

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
Nevermind...

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] Nah, if I even suggest
this Nagahiro'll be pissed,

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
so it's better
to leave it alone.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.135 position:50% align:center
Well, Nagahiro getting pissed is

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
something I have
no control over,

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
but this is a theory that
I don't think'll play very well

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
with our leader.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
And that's what
I'm worried about.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
Thing is, before
we hash out whether or not

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
the "hit-and-run perpetrator"
exists,

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
it's worth asking whether
we all think the accident

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
even happened
in the first place.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
Wait. What are
you talking about?

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
Are you saying it
was all a sham?

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Look, I wish I weren't

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
and judging by the
face you just made,

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
I sure as hell can't bring this
to Nagahiro or our leader.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
It's just that, even if

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
there aren't any eyewitnesses
there is a testimony.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
She was talking to a friend
when she got run over.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but the friend couldn't
actually see the car

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
when it happened.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be that hard
to play someone

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
a recording over
your phone in order

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
to sell them on a fake accident.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
Hell.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
All things considered,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
it's not impossible that
the friend's in on it.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] So the accident
could have been faked?

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
If that's true...

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
...then it would
account for why

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
we have no evidence
or testimony.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Question is, what would
the point have been?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
Why would Naganawa go
through all the trouble

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
of faking something like that?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] If we're going
to assume that it was a sham,

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
the only motive I can think of
makes me sick to my stomach.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
The first thing
that comes to mind is,

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.258 position:50% align:center
she dreaded the
idea of being elected.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
But is that really the first
thing that came to mind?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] By stepping down
right before the election,

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
under the guise of
an unforeseen accident,

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
she intended to sabotage
the continuation

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
of the current regime.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
She wanted to ruin
the political balance

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
Mr. Senpai had worked to create.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
Perhaps, by secretly
communicating

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
with another candidate?

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
For instance, the current
top candidate, Yokuya.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
Not so sure about that,

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
it makes a lot more sense to me

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
that she'd be in league
with the academy.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
With the academy?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] It's no secret that
Nagahiro's position on things

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
goes against the
academy's agenda.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
So, for the academy,

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
wouldn't it be easier
to lure his successor over

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
to their side than
to back another candidate

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
and try to take the
Nagahiro camp head-on?

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] We need to
visit Naganawa tomorrow

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.979 position:50% align:center
after school or
as soon as possible.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
Without telling Nagahiro.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Come.
We're going to meet Mr. Odoru.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI "Mr. Odoru,"
as in, Odoru Sotoin.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
The founder of the
Pretty Boy Detective Club,

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
and the older brother of our
current leader, Manabu Sotoin.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
People called him
"Odoru the Epic."

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] At this rate,
the campaign may drag on,

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
and we can't
allow that to happen.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
We're going to employ
an ace-in-the-hole,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
one I'd hoped
wouldn't be necessary.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
So, um, where exactly
is Odoru these days?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
He's ahead of us.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
Wait, you mean
our leader's big brother

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
is living inside
our heads as we speak?

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
No, he's not "inside our heads,"

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.774 position:50% align:center
though I'm beginning to wonder
what's inside of yours.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
What I mean is,
he's in his second year,

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
at Yubiwa High School.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] So, is the plan
to go ask him for his advice

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
as the former leader of the
Pretty Boy Detective Club?

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
We're not here
to speak to Mr. Odoru

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
as our club's
first leader, but rather

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
as my predecessor
the former president

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
of the student council.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.001 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He was a student
council president?

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Yes.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
Mr. Odoru was nothing
short of legendary

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
during his tenure as
student council president.

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
The third years still
talk about him to this day.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
I can never hope
to live up to his legacy.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] At the end of the
day, it seems I was inadequate.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
My support alone was not enough

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
to give you the
majority you needed.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.649 position:50% align:center
At any rate, I figure
with Mr. Odoru's help

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
we'll make up the difference.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Makes sense.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
Although it feels like
we should have brought

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
our leader along with us
after all, he's our--

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
Our leader will not be
part of this conversation.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center
Is it because the two of them
no longer get along?

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
No, it's nothing that severe...

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well, you'll see
when you meet him.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Odoru, the founder of
the Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
Odoru the Epic.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
But more than that,
our leader's older brother.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
I let my imagination
get the better of me.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
But, after building him up
so much in my head,

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
he was nothing at
all like I expected.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
How to describe him...

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
A smart looking,
mundane kind of guy.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you,
my name is Odoru Sotoin.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
So you must be Mayumi?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
I've heard a lot about
you from Sakiguchi.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
I understand that you're running
for student council president?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.288 position:50% align:center
Best of luck.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
If Sakiguchi endorses you,
then so do I.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center
You're welcome to use
my name in any way you like.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
Oh, and before I forget,

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
give my regards
to my little brother,

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
and ask him when
he's going to stop

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
letting the older kids
spoil him rotten.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
He's so normal.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
He's just a regular,
ordinary, nice guy.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I could have guessed

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
that this was leader's
older brother.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
The resemblance is there.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
Leader may very well look
like this once he grows up.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
And yet, there was something
about him that just felt off.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
It felt like he was
distancing himself

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.991 position:50% align:center
in some way even from
an old friend like Mr. Senpai.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
He was awkward and standoffish.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
So I was wondering,
are you still a member

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
of the student council now
that you're in high school?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
[ODORU]
Uh, I'm not...

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
See the truth is,

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
I don't really do things
like that anymore.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh...

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.305 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He said it in a way
that made me feel like

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
it would be rude to keep
asking him questions.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
It's as if the time he spent

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
as student council president
was something

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
to be embarrassed about.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
Like I'd uncovered
his past as some delinquent.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
[ODORU]
I appreciate you taking care

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.862 position:50% align:center
of my little brother, Sakiguchi.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
Just don't lose track
of what's important, okay?

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
You're entering
high school soon.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
It's a big deal.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
You're not going to have time
for kid stuff anymore.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Right. Yeah. Sure...

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The fact that he was
student council president

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
and that he founded the
Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
are just memories now,
pieces of Odoru's past.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
It's not that he wants to
pretend they never happened,

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
it's just that he's no
longer trying to push back

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
against the academy,
and he's no longer trying

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50% align:center
to be pretty, nor a boy,
nor a detective.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
And while there's
no doubt he's an old friend,

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.524 position:50% align:center
he's not part of the team.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
What made him do it
in the first place,

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
what had it all meant to him,

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
and why had it been
so easy to move on,

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
he can't remember;
it's in the past.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
He just doesn't really
do things like that anymore.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.288 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
That's the thing,

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:06.833 position:50% align:center
the Odoru I remember used
to speak in song and dance.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.295 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy Detective Club
was radiant with him around.

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
Each and every day, it felt
as though we were in a musical.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.384 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Odoru the Epic.

00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
When he turned them into song,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
every case became
the stuff of legend.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.891 position:50% align:center
It's a shame he gave up
both song and dance

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
when he entered high school.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Did he say why he gave them up?

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Oh, he gave me
one excuse or another

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
about being too busy
with his studies

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
and how competitive it was.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
Who knows if that's
what really happened?

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
It makes you think,
right now I'm just

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
a petty kid without a care,

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
but when I enter high school,

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
am I going to have
to leave all that behind?

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
Luckily, your pettiness
is a lifelong condition,

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure you've got
nothing to worry about.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Growth, evolution,
rehabilitation, maturity.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
My pettiness notwithstanding,
in all likelihood,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
I won't be cross-dressing as
a second-year in high school.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
It's just a passing phase,
something transient,

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
that is to say,
it's just "kid stuff."

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
A momentary pleasure
that I'm bound

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
to leave behind someday.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
Mr. Odoru Sotoin.

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
No matter his past,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
he is now an ordinary
second year in high school.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
So, if that's normal,

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.994 position:50% align:center
then...

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
...what am I supposed
to make of him?

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
That boy, Kinshiro Yokuya,
may seem like

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
he's a run-of-the-mill
middle schooler,

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
but he's not normal.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
He is anything but normal.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] When word got around
about my latest endorsement,

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
that I had the support of both

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.100 position:50% align:center
the current student council
president and his predecessor,

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
my projected approval rating,

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
as reported by
the school newspaper,

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
immediately spiked, landing me
comfortably in second place.

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
All that, and only second place.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
I needed one more decisive move.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
And whether this would
become that decisive move

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center
or if it would
backfire horrendously,

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
for better or worse,
it was worth a shot.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
I met up with Mr. Delinquent
after school let out that day,

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
and we headed over
to the hospital where Naganawa,

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
the original candidate,
was checked in.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
Get ready, Naganawa.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
Because Team Petty
is coming for you!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
Out of context, it sounds like
we're about to commit a crime.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.012 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:26.598 position:50% align:center
Unrelated, but have
you ever met Odoru Sotoin?

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
I've met him a couple'a times

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
just by being around leader.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
I mean, he'd already
reformed himself

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
for the most part
by the time I came around.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
People say, "ahh, man,
he's become such a dull adult."

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
But you know what that
"dull adult's" thinking?

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
He's probably thinking, "man,
I used to be such a dull child."

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I guess, although it
feels like a bit of a stretch

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
to refer to a second year
in high school as an adult.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
But either way,

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
in this case I'd say that
it's pretty cut and dry,

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
Odoru's just not the
pretty boy he once was.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
He's lost his spark.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
"Lost" feels like a
pretty one-sided way

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:00.715 position:50% align:center
of looking at it,
don't you think?

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
From his point of view,

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
he may have just "found"
what matters to him.

00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
Heeey. Chin up.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
Even if you were to
mellow out in high school,

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
you'll always be petty to me.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
Well, what about you?!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll grow into
a whole new person

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
once you get to high school!

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.440 position:50% align:center
Then it'll be you who's saying,

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
"I used to be such a badass
troublemaker in my youth."

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, I guess,

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.032 position:50% align:center
I dunno if I'm actually
even gonna go to high school...

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh...?

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen, Mayumi,
about the hit-and-run case.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
I wanted to
double-check something,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
so I snuck out during lunch
break to go take another look.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Go back...

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
What did you just say...?

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
I said, I snuck outta school
during lunch break,

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
and I inspected the scene again.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
Gotta turn over every stone.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
So you know how that street is
all uphill and one-way?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
What about it...?

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] Naganawa got run over
on her way home from school

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
so that would mean
she was walking downhill

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.814 position:50% align:center
on the sidewalk right
before it happened.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
As she was approaching
the crosswalk,

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
she would have been at
an angle that let her see

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
all the way down the hill

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
at least until she turned
to cross the street.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
So wouldn't that mean she'd have

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.660 position:50% align:center
had clear visual confirmation
of the oncoming car?

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] That's a possibility
we hadn't even considered.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
Because the crosswalk cuts
perpendicularly across the road,

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
it's easy to imagine
the accident from the side

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
with the incoming car
blindsiding her,

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
but rewind time a few moments,

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
and she's in a position
with a clear line of sight,

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
so she should have
been able to see

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.804 position:50% align:center
the car coming long
before the crosswalk.

00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] If she did catch
sight of the car on her way

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
down the hill, don't you think
the normal response would be

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
to wait for the car to pass,

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
regardless of what the
crosswalk signal said?

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Yeah, you're right...

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
the same goes for the driver

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
who should have been
able to see Naganawa

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
coming without any difficulty.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
Because Hill D sees
so little traffic,

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
it feels dangerous,

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
so it seemed like an easy
place for a hit-and-run.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
But if you think about it,

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50% align:center
that concern is exactly
what would make it hard.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:56.664 position:50% align:center
And there's no way
you could make it

00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
look like an accident.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:00.669 position:50% align:center
Meaning, if you wanted to
run someone over intentionally,

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
this would be a terrible
spot to try and do it.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
So what is the significance
of this location?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.094 position:50% align:center
There's no way it
can be an accident,

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
but we may have just proven
that it can sell one...

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mr. Delinquent,
if Naganawa's a traitor,

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
just so I can make sure
we're on the same page,

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
what's our plan?

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
Do we tell Mr. Senpai
or Leader about it?

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
Hell no, we don't
tell them about it...

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
We take it to our graves.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
It'd be a life-long secret
between us.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
Just focus on
winning the election.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
Um, hi there. Welcome.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Can I help you with something?

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] She didn't
strike me as a Snow Queen

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
much less a vice-president.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
I can kind of understand why
Fukuroi would be visiting me,

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
but sorry to ask, who are you?

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
I know that I've seen you
before. Class B, I think...

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Whoa. She knows about me.

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
Not that it's strange,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
I guess, that a member of the
student council would have

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
heard of the "mysterious
cross-dressing girl."

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
You're the girl who was really
interested in astronomy.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] She knew me
before my cross-dressing!

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
I stand before
a very astute lady.

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
I'm Mayumi Dojima.

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
I'm here 'cause Mr. Senp--

00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
Uhh, I-mean,
Sakiguchi said to stop by

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
and introduce myself to you!

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
Ah! Is that so?!

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you!

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
That means you're
the amazing girl

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
who decided to run
in my place, aren't you?!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!!

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
Oh! This is perfect!

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
There was something
I wanted to give you!

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
I know... it's not
really my race anymore,

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
so this is probably overkill,

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
but I wanted to be of
any help that I could.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
So I made a scrapbook
of the work I did

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
as vice-president and
collected and collated

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
every back issue of our
school paper that I had!

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
It's all yours!

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Please take it home.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hey, don't hide from me.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
We're here because
you wanted to be here!

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
I never imagined the
dreaded "Snow Queen"

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
would turn out to be such
a genuinely friendly girl.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
Not to mention, so generous!

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:02.874 position:50% align:center
Look, Fukuroi.

00:18:02.957 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
I won't pretend
we don't have issues,

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
but if you're truly willing
to help us win this election,

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
then we can call a truce.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
Sure, I guess so.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
There's something we want
to ask you, Naganawa.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us
about the accident?

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
And please be specific.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Rule number three:
Be a detective.

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:26.147 position:50% align:center
Tell you about the accident?

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:27.399 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
Why would you want me
to tell you about that?

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
Don't be alarmed!

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
We're asking everyone
who was involved.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
Crap! That's a
stock phrase you use

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
when you're asking for alibis!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
One of Miss Mayumi's
campaign pledges

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
is to reassess
and improve the safety

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
of school routes used
for student commutes.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Sakiguchi felt it would
behoove us to remedy

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
any concerns you may have,

00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
that it may provide you some
comfort in this uncertain time.

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Wait, no, but, Mr. Delinquent,

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
I had believed you
to be an honest boy

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
who was too pure to tell lies.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
I can never trust you again...

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's very kind...

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
Although, as I told
Sakiguchi earlier,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able
to remember all that much.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
For instance,
I don't remember the car make

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
or the license plate number,

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
let alone why in
the world I decided

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
to take Hill D on my
way home in the first place.

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
If I'd just taken
my usual school route,

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
this wouldn't have happened...

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Just so we're clear,

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
you don't normally
take Hill D home?

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.957 position:50% align:center
Right. I only take it
if I'm in a hurry

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
or if I have a
special reason to be there.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] So which one was it,
was she in a hurry,

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
or was there a special reason?

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
As it would turn out,

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
it didn't matter
what her reason was

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.929 position:50% align:center
because as we continued
our interrogation,

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
it became increasingly clear
we were getting nowhere,

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
and that the odds of her
accident being a charade

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
were extremely unlikely,
to say the least.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
In the end, Naganawa was
no longer under suspicion.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
And although it was
a really nice visit...

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
We were right back
to square one...

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Well, Mr. Delinquent,
as promised,

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
we'll keep the existence of this
mission a secret between us,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
and we take it to the grave!

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
That was only the plan if our
hunch about her was correct.

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
We'll report this to
our leader and Nagahiro,

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
and make sure that
all the facts check out.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
Oh no, you totally
weren't won over

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
by the vice-president's charm.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
If it had turned out that
Naganawa was a traitor,

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
and we could prove it,
we could have followed that lead

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
all the way up the chain
to uncover the mastermind.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:29.479 position:50% align:center
But it seemed as if no
such mastermind existed.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
At least, there wasn't one
connected with Naganawa.

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
So I let my guard down.

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
But the fact that such
a mastermind didn't exist,

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.199 position:50% align:center
meant that at
the end of the day,

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
we couldn't rule
out the possibility

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:46.079 position:50% align:center
that the "hit-and-run
perpetrator" did exist.

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
as a substitute candidate
for Wana Naganawa,

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
there was still
a very real possibility

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
that I could be the target of
a car, when I least expect it.

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
I completely forgotten that.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
There's no doubt.

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
It had meant to hit me.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.979 position:50% align:center
Mayumi! Check the plates!

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
<i>Probatio Diabolica.</i>

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
It was a devil all right,

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
and the "hit-and-run
perpetrator of Hill D."

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
That much is clear.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Dammit,

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50% align:center
who the hell...

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Don't worry. That's clear, too.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
For real?

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Even as my body
flew through the air,

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
I was able keep my eyes trained
on the car targeting me

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.971 position:50% align:center
as it drove by.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:46.598 position:50% align:center
I was able to see
the driver clearly

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
