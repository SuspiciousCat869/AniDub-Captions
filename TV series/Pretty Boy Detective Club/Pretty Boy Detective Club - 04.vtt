[MAYUMI]
Hm?

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:50.545 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.637 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.308 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hold on! Excuse me!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Huh? What's this?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
Is there something the matter?

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
U-Um, sorry, but...

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
I... think you dropped this.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:18.698 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Oh, did I?

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
Why, how embarrassing.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
My stars! To think
that I could be so careless!

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
Quite the good deed...

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
...young lad.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait a second! Please!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Where...?

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, Dojima?

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute, don't tell me.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
I bet you've got another
case for us, is that it?

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Oh, I know!

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
It's about that bulge in
your breast pocket, isn't it?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Holy...

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
My, oh, my.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Hmm...
This is quite intriguing!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
A wad of cash and a man
disappearing into thin air...

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
Now this is a mystery!

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Hmm?
What's the matter, Sosaku?

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
It looks as if you
have something to say.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I wonder...

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Maybe this is
his first time seeing

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
a paltry 10,000 yen bill,
and he finds it unusual.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
And what exactly
do you see, Leader?

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Our dear Sosaku pointed out

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50% align:center
the fact that I hold in
my hand a counterfeit.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.972 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
This is... a counterfeit?

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] But it has all
the proper watermarks.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
I can't help but
think this is real.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.104 position:50% align:center
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
There's no question of
this funny money's quality.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
Actually, Sosaku's saying
the quality's too good.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.237 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
the benefit-cost ratio
on these counterfeits

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
is not in their favor.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
It's actually costing
them over 10,000 yen

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
to create each 10,000 yen bill.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Precisely.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.500 position:50% align:center
Very well put.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
I'd expect no less
of the Orator.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Spending more than 10,000 yen

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
to make a 10,000 yen bill...

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
Why would anyone even
do something like that?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
That's the question, isn't it?

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
They could make
the inauthentic appear

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.682 position:50% align:center
more than authentic
with such a budget.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Bills made to look

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
just like the real thing, huh?

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
I think I get it.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
So basically,
it's just play money

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
made for fun or
a hobby or something.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
That's just stupid.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter if
the money's real or not.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
What kind of "honest"
businessman goes around

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
with a huge wad of cash
in their pocket?

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
Seems sketchy.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Doesn't matter?

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.665 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
I'd definitely be twice
as scared of the guy

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
carrying around a
few counterfeit bills,

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
than I would of someone

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
carrying a million
genuine yen in their pocket.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
No question.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Beautiful!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
A counterfeit bill
that costs more to make

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
than it's worth...

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
That's the true
essence of beauty.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
It has a brilliance
that's simply indescribable.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
I simply can't
contain my curiosity!

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, Dojima.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
I thought your eyes
could see through anything.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
And you're saying to me

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
that you couldn't tell it was
a counterfeit from the start?

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
I suppose now
that you mention it,

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
it's strange that Mayumi
the Seer missed it.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.454 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Who does he think
he is, giving me a nickname??

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.122 position:50% align:center
And "Mayumi the Seer"?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Well, I was wearing
my glasses at the time,

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
so it couldn't be helped.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
Your glasses?

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
Aah, that's right.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
You use those glasses
to restrict your eyesight.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center
It's too bad they
also obstruct your beauty.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
Now, if you'll please...

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.726 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Let's see...

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
H-Hey, wait...

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
I can't tell what it is,

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
but there's something's inside
this bill, I'm sure of it.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Inside the bill?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
You're not making any sense

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
A-hem.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
Michiru...

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
Sosaku seems to be saying
you can leave this up to him.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Let's see.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
Well, well, well!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
Guess what, boys?

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
It appears that
this counterfeit bill

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
was housing a
mysterious invitation.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
An invitation?

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
"Congratulations.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
You are the lucky
recipient of an entry ticket

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
to our grand casino,
Reasonable Doubt."

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
This sounds like a scam!

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
It says here they
hold it every Sunday.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
It's settled, then!

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
On Sunday Night,
we'll all meet up here

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
and head over to
the casino together

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
which is located at the, um...

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
I don't know this kanji.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
Could you please tell us
where the venue is?

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Let's see.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
It says here that it's

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
at Kamikazari Middle School,
Gymnasium #2.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
Well, if anything, we'll go so
we can return Mr. Businessman's

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
100,000 yen,
even if it is counterfeit.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
And it also says that they
enforce a casual dress code.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
What do they mean by a
"casual dress code"?

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
Casual or not, all I've got
in my closet are tons of shorts.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] It means not to
go all-out with your outift.

00:08:58.872 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
I see...

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
Don't go all-out...

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
Mm. Mm.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The way he nodded
had me all-out worried.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
So, Mayumi Dojima,

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
looks like you're
just about ready.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs]

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
Sosaku's satisfied
with the finished product!

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
What a beautiful
exchange between cohorts!

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
The time has come, boys!

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
Let us depart!

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy
Detective Club's on the case!

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
And just like
we have always done...

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
Tonight... we will be beautiful!

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
We will be boys!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
And we will be detectives!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
--[MICHIRU] Sure.
--[HYOTA] Okay.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Yes, of course.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Whenever I witnessed

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
their perfectly
coordinated teamwork,

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
I felt as if there was
no room for me to join in.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but feel
a sense of inferiority.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:08.566 position:50% align:center
However, thanks to the
Artiste, I am a pretty boy.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Or at least I am for now...

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
and if only on the surface.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
I am Mayumi the Seer.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
And we will be a team...

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The casino was a paradise.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
Adding to the atmosphere
were the other guests,

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
who themselves were
all dressed to the nines...

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
...and all of them teenagers

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
who looked to be
of middle-school age.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
Welcome, all,
to the Reasonable Doubt.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
Pardon me for asking, but I will
need to see your invitation.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
Oh, right... Here you are.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
[BUNNYGIRL]
Ah. Wonderful.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
Now, then!

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
The chip exchange can be found
to the right of the stage.

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
You'll want to head there first.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
And the cashier is to your left.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The cashier?!

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
Despite its customers,

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
there's nothing childish
about this casino.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
No play money here...

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
...only the real deal.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
And, so...

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
Welcome And have
a great time here

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.278 position:50% align:center
at the Reasonable Doubt Casino!

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.946 position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
No point in
just standing around.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.079 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
Let's see what's worth playing.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Be sure to gather
some information as well, Hyota.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.170 position:50% align:center
Don't lose sight of
our initial objective.

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
A bet is worth a thousand words.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
Show your aesthetic
with every wager!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
Now where exactly
do you think <i>you're</i> going?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
No games for you, Young Dojima.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
No matter what game
you try your hand at,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
the odds will be in your favor

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
because of your eyesight,
Mayumi the Seer.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
You'll see through
every card, dice, or wheel.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
I seriously doubt that
you wish to cheat others

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
out of their money.

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Sotoin did have a point.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's not like I knew
the rules of most casino games.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He chose blackjack,
of all things.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
Does he even know how to play?

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
Considering my own ignorance,
I shouldn't be judging.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Ah, poker.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
At least I know
the basics of that one.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Well, this
might be the easiest game

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
to understand in a casino.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Baccarat...?

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
Um, I don't think I've even
heard of that one.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
The slot machine...

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
As expected,
he seems to prefer games

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
he can play by himself.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Based on what I've seen,

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
it's at least an honest casino,
if such a thing exists.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
At the very least,

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
they don't seem intent
on swindling children

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
out of their lunch money.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
But it's still illegal, right?

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, sir.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
Is there anything
I can help you with?

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
It appears you aren't
really enjoying yourself.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter...

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.504 position:50% align:center
my good man?

00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
No! Uh, everything's fine.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
I just don't know these games.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
It's my first time
in a casino, you see.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
I tagged along
with a few friends...

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
Is that so...?

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
A few friends, huh?

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
Well, then allow
me to entertain you.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
How about a children's game?

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
We could play some Othello.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
But you are...?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
Oh, how rude of me.

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
You may call me, Fudatsuki.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
I have the privilege
of being the manager here

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
at the famous
Reasonable Doubt Casino.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
I also happen to be the
student council president here

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
at Kamikazari Middle School...

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Student council president?

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
Wait. You mean he's
not a businessman,

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
but a middle school student?!

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
Um, since you're the
student council president,

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
does that mean
you're a third-year?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Not at all. I'm a second year.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
The change of power occurs
quickly at our school...

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
unlike at your Yubiwa Academy.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He knows I'm a
student at Yubiwa Academy...?

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
But how did he figure it out?

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Of course...

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
When I saw him, I was
wearing my school uniform.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
It was a brief encounter,

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.990 position:50% align:center
but long enough
for him to notice.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:10.201 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
I need to exercise caution...

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] ...as a member of
the Pretty Boy Detective Club!

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Black or white?

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
You may choose
whichever you prefer.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
Based on the pensive
look on your face,

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
I'd wager that
something's on your mind.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm simply nervous about
the nature of this place.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
I mean, a casino...

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
And it's right in
the middle of a school?

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
[LAI chuckles]

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
So that's what's troubling you?

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
You can rest assured.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
There is nothing to worry about.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Nothing to worry about, huh?

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
And why would that be?

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
If you don't mind, sir,

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
how did you happen

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
to come across this
casino in the first place?

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] We found an
invitation that was hidden

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
inside a counterfeit bill.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.094 position:50% align:center
Do you use other methods?

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Numerous.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.472 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
sending out invitations,

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
we try all sorts
of elaborate methods...

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
Be it by hook or by crook, we
strive to entertain our clients.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
And if someone has enough
of a playful spirit

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
to discover one
of our invitations,

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'd
find it too amusing

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
to ever report our goings-on.

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Therefore, it's a safe bet
that our secret is secure.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A "playful spirit"...

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
What an interesting way

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:43.128 position:50% align:center
to describe someone
with a "criminal mind."

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
It would take a "playful spirit"
to create a counterfeit bill.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
Just as I'm sure it would
take a "playful spirit"

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
to create a casino like this.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
I'm curious.

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
Is this place profitable?

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
My, oh my.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
Now don't tell me you're worried

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.312 position:50% align:center
for the well-being
of our little venture.

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the concern.

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
Let's just say
we do well enough.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
Besides, this isn't the
only business venture

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
I have a hand in.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
It's just for fun.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
Pure entertainment.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
I'd wager we make a buck or two.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, sir.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
There's been a problem.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
Well, look who it is...

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
I bet Yubiwa Academy's
student council president...

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
is one of the friends
you tagged along with.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Of course he figured it out.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'd call us
friends, necessarily,

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
But, um, yes,
he did come here with me.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
[LAI laughs]
Is that more worry I hear?

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
You must be afraid of what
I'm going to do with him.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
Well, fret not.

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
I'll be treating
our lucky fellow

00:17:57.077 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
to a particularly
special program.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs] Our vice
president is quite commendable,

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you say?

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
Plus, if you ask me,

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
he presents a rather
striking figure on stage.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
What do you think,
Mayumi Dojima?

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A "special program."

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
patrons who win more than

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
a certain amount of money
are given the "opportunity"

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
to go on stage,

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
where they face the casino
manager himself in a showdown.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
It's big deal
whenever it happens,

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
so it's considered a
main event for the casino.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
They even put it
on-stage for all to see.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:38.451 position:50% align:center
And as expected,
there's gambling involved.

00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
As for the manager,

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
he hasn't lost a single
game on this special program.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.332 position:50% align:center
Not one.

00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
To play, the challenger must put

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
all of their winnings
on the table.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
That means every last chip.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
And if by some stroke of luck,

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
the challenger wins
against those odds...

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
they don't just get triple,
or even ten times their bet.

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
No, they get much more.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
It's winner-take-all.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
Literally.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
The casino itself
is the grand prize,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
and the right to operate
it is given to the winner.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
Absolute confidence.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
Or absolute playfulness?

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's just
absolutely criminal.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
A-HEM!

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
No need to be so tense,
Mayumi Dojima.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
There is absolutely
nothing to fear.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
Nagahiro's up there
on his own accord.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
He knows exactly
what he's doing!

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
[BUNNYGIRL]
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.882 position:50% align:center
This is our first
Special Program in a while!

00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?!

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
Without further ado,
let's begin!

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
Hey. Do all of you guys
know the casino manager?

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
We've never met,
but I know who he is.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
Kamikazari's student
council president.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Rumor has it he's shrewd,
unlike our own leader.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised he runs
an operation like this

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
behind everyone's backs.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
It looks like Nagahiro made a
play that surprised everyone.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He set up
something that unexpected?

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Who knows?

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
I, for one, am ignorant
to the rules of poker.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
I have no clue what's going on!

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
You don't know, either?

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Unfortunately,
I'm not a learned boy.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
The only thing I have
is my aesthetic.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] As the game continued,
round two went to Sakiguchi.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
At least, I think it did.

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Then Fudatsuki,
he apparently won round three.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
Or so I'm told.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
Sakiguchi was leading 2-to-1,

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
but both players seemed to be
right back where they started.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
And that back-and-forth
continued with no end in sight.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] That is... until
the incident happened.

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No one else...

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
Only I noticed.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
I was the only one who saw.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Wait.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
who can see him?

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What the...?

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:49.100 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.353 position:50% align:center
How--? What the--?

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What?!

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What?!

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:13.375 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.213 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
This whole thing's a scam!
