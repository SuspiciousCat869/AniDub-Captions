"I disapprove of what you say,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
but I will defend to the
death your right to say it."

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
As famously said by the
French philosopher Voltaire.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.702 position:50% align:center
After making his objection
abundantly clear,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
he declares he has
no intent to debate,

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
nor does he have a shred
of interest in taking a seat

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
at the debate table.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
Like "don't kill it, but
don't let it live, either."

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
That pretty much sums up
how my opinion was crushed.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.469 position:50% align:center
Actually, "opinion" isn't right.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
No, it was more like a dream.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
And that is why...

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
this is the story
of how I, Mayumi Dojima,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
wound up giving up
on that dream.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
But I do know
one thing for sure.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
That boy, that pretty boy,
would have this to say:

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
"Following one's dream
is certainly beautiful.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
But, to give up on one's dream

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
can have a
similar beauty to it."

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
"And that's only revealed

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
if you choose to give up
on it yourself."

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.333 position:50% align:center
Honestly, that pretty boy...

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
said surprisingly
handsome things.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
Finally, I have one last thought

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
regarding Voltaire's all
but perfect maxim...

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
It may sound arrogant,
but I'd like to add one caveat.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
To wit, you can't defend
anything if you're dead.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
I've always enjoyed gazing up
at the stars in the night sky

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
from the school rooftop.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:56.449 position:50% align:center
But tomorrow, October 10th,
my 14th birthday...

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
...everything changes.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.331 position:50% align:center
I will never look up at
the night sky like this again.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.625 position:50% align:center
Tonight's the last time.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
No more games in the second
year of middle school.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:13.466 position:50% align:center
At least that's the promise
I made to my "dear parents."

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
You looking for something?

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Oh. Crap.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
So beautiful...

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Yet no matter how stunning...

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
it was still different
from the starry sky

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
I so desperately sought--

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50% align:center
You're not hurt, are you?

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Uh...

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.251 position:50% align:center
No, I, uh...

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
Th-Thank you.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
Huh...

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
Let me guess.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
You're out here
stargazing, aren't you?

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
What gives you that idea?

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Why...

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
...it's elementary,
my dear and quite simple.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
What other reason is there
to be alone on a rooftop?

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50% align:center
Especially at this hour.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
I'm also a fan of the stars.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
I love those celestial
glimmering lights.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
They cast the most
wondrous glow upon me.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
Looking for something?

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Why do you think that?

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.250 position:50% align:center
Why, that's also elementary.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
The most elementary
of elementary.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
Only someone completely
absorbed in their search

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
would fail to notice
my beautiful self

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
standing right next to them...

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
...just close enough to touch.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] He totally referred to
himself as "my beautiful self."

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Now I failed to notice...

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.438 position:50% align:center
I'm never this careless...

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
But it's so obvious.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
Your eyes shine as brightly
as the stars you so adore.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
Why would you hide those
beautiful eyes of yours

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
behind those spectacles?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
Hiding your allure
would be a shame.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
There's no need to worry.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center
For beauty is something that
should never be compared.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
So even if you're
standing next to me,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
the glow of your eyes
will never be dulled.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
I am looking for something.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
And if you don't mind,
I could use some assistance.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
I don't mind at all!

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
To selflessly serve others

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
is the foundation of beauty!

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
Come with me.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Uh.
Wait! Where are we going?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Isn't it obvious?

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
Where else?

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
To the Pretty Boy Detective Club
headquarters, of course!

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The ambiguously named
"Pretty Boy Detective Club"

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
is a clandestine organization
that supposedly exists

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
at Yubiwa Academy, the private
middle school that I attend.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
All their activities
are done in secret.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
This unofficial, undercover,
nonprofit organization

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
claims to resolve all kinds
of problems within the academy.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
In reality, however, it's
suspected that they may actually

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.892 position:50% align:center
have been the root
cause of these problems.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
The truth about the club
is shrouded in mystery.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
Not only are
its actions unknown,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
but the very identities of
its members are closely guarded.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Even if you were lucky enough
to come across a student

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
who worked with them,

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
it's pointless to try
to get them to talk.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
Something about an obligation
to confidentiality.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, no, no.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
A detective club where clients

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
are obligated
to confidentiality?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
What's the deal with that?

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
This place is...

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
...the art room?

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it this time?

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.814 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
brought over a chick

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
who's as drab as India ink.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
She probably searches for
the word "regret" on news sites

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
just to scroll
through the results.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
I mean, look at her.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
Only someone as sullen
as her would enjoy that.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
I bet the misfortunes of
others really gets her off.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.956 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Michiru Fukuroi.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Year 2, Class A.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
An infamous delinquent
feared by many.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
He is known by many names.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
But most call him "Bossman."

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
If you ranked the students
you should never mess with

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
at Yubiwa Academy,

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
he'd be at the top of that
list without a doubt.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Come now, Michiru.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
You know much better than
to be so incessantly rude

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
to a young woman
whom you've only just met.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Allow me to express

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
just how regretful this
makes me feel toward you.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
Now would you look at that.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
You see, we've added a touch
more regret to this world

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:49.784 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
Nagahiro Sakiguchi.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
Year 3, Class A.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
He's our student
council president

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
for the third year in a row.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
A master orator
who won the position

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
when he gave a speech
as representative

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
of the incoming class right
after entering the academy--

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
without election!

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
Even professional voice actors

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
have marveled at
his captivating voice.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
Those who've heard him speak
have become spellbound,

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
and girls from all over
have fallen for his charm.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
Imagine my surprise at the sight
of Mitchiru "Bossman" Fukuroi,

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
the bad boy of Yubiwa Academy,
and Nagahiro Sakiguchi,

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
the student body president

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
who basically represents
honor students,

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
in the same room together.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
Hah. Don't go bitching at me

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.658 position:50% align:center
while drinking the tea
I brewed for you.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
Heh. Now, now.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm badmouthing
your tasty tea, Michiru.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Yeah, Michiru, come on.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
Just chill out!

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
You see a girl as cute as this,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
and the best you can do
is call her sullen?

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
Me? I would've proposed.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
Been like, "Hey,
wanna come live with me?"

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
as soon as I saw
her pretty face.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.303 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hyota Ashikaga, year 1, class A.

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
Only a first-year, and
already the track team's ace.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] His cute,
perfectly proportioned face

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
isn't merely that of an angel,

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
but of an archangel who
leads all the other angels.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
And those beautiful legs.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're that second-year,
Mayumi Dojima, right?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
It's very nice
to meet ya, Dojima!

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Sosaku Yubiwa, year 1, class A.

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
The heir to the
Yubiwa Foundation,

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
our school's parent
organization.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
Not only is he
a brilliant student,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
but he literally operates the
Yubiwa Foundation on his own.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
In fact, for all
intents and purposes,

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:38.351 position:50% align:center
this precocious 12-year-old
is the chairman.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
That's when it
all came together.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] This truly was a
"Pretty Boy Detective Club."

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
After seeing these
four as its members,

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
nobody would argue
about the club's name.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
But that's what made it
all the more bewildering.

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
Why would they come
together in club like this?

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
I must say again
what a pleasure it is

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
to meet you, Mayumi Dojima!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
And I am the
beautiful president

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.883 position:50% align:center
of the Pretty Boy Detective
Club, Manabu Sotoin!

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] So proclaimed the
headman who led the bossman,

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
the councilman,
the archangel-man...

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
...and even the chairman.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
His was a name I'd
never heard of before.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
He was a student
I'd never seen before.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
This was a pretty boy...

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
I'd never known before.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The president?

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
This guy?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
Come on, now,
just look at her, lads!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
When was the last time you
saw such beautiful eyes?

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
Get an eyeful.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
Stare so hard you'll
burn a hole in her!

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
[laughs] We've made her blush;
she's turned beet red.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
Well, to show such modesty
is beautiful in its own way.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I hate beautiful people!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
You go around
expecting everything

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
to go exactly how you want it.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.731 position:50% align:center
All because you're handsome.

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Now I've done it.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
At least...
I got to tell them off.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
[laughter]

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
How rude of me.
My apologies.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
It's... just that what
you said is so typical.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter who
the client is, a guy or a girl.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
They basically say
the same kinda thing.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
That beauty itself is worthless.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, totally.

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
But they always come
to realize the value of beauty

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
by the time we're
done with the case!

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dojima.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
For the record,

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
there is but one revision
to your statement

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
that I must request.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
I will submit to accepting

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
the phrase "beautiful people"
as a proud burden.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
However, I would like to ask

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
that you kindly retract
the word "handsome."

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
It makes us sound ostentatious.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
And that's not really
what we're about.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Are "beautiful"
and "handsome" even different?

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.874 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
It's the Pretty Boy
Detective Club's first rule.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Which is, of course,
to be pretty.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The fact they're
taking this so seriously

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.886 position:50% align:center
makes it sound interesting.

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
All right...

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
I'll make a formal request.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
Great. You're looking
for something, right?

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
I'm looking...

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
...for a long-lost star.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
I've searched for ten years.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
I've been trying to find
that star this entire time.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
A specific star.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
One that I saw...

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
...ten years ago.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] We swam in the ocean,
barbequed on the beach,

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
and set off fireworks.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
But none of that
compared to the thing

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
that struck me
most during our trip...

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
...that brilliant starry sky.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
Out of all the stars that night,

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
there was one that
was particularly dazzling.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
It was incredibly bright
and seemed so close,

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
it almost felt like if I just
reached out, I could touch it.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
I wanted to visit it someday.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
More than anything, I wanted
to feel its warmth in my hand.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
And that was the day my dream of
becoming an astronaut was born.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
However...

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
...the star that
moved me so deeply,,,

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
...the star that should have
determined my future...

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
...eluded me.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
I had lost sight of it.

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
Since I returned from that trip,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.142 position:50% align:center
I've combed the
night sky for that star.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
Night after night, I search.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
And yet, no matter where in the
sky or the time of night I look,

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:56.776 position:50% align:center
that star is nowhere to be seen.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
When I began middle school,

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
they finally told me to
"stop dreaming."

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
They didn't mince their words.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
No more playing games
in my second year.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
If I couldn't find that star
by the beginning

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
of my second year
of middle school,

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
I promised to completely
give up my dream

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.627 position:50% align:center
of becoming an astronaut.

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
But little did I realize...

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
...that life as I knew it...

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
...would soon come
to a screeching halt.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
As of my 14th birthday,

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
my star search
would come to an end.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.895 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
How beautiful!

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.189 position:50% align:center
The search for
a brilliant lost star!

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
This is perfect!

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
It's exactly the
kind of epic case

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
that the Pretty Boy Detective
Club is meant to take on!

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Epic...

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it sure is epic.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
Damn.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
Looks like this is gonna be
one ambitious piece of work.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Well, well.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
Lucky you!

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
The president's
gonna take your case.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
So you mean
you're actually going

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.045 position:50% align:center
to accept my childish request?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
We prefer a bit of childishness.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Or rather, you could say
that it's essential.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy Detective
Club's second rule.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
Be a boy, obviously!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.518 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Be a boy, huh?

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've just been told
something very important.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
As if I'd been reminded

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
of something I was
on the verge of losing.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Totally!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
The most important thing

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
is to never forget
to be a child at heart!

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm gonna wear
shorts for the rest of my life!

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.538 position:50% align:center
I'm Hyota the Adonis.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
He of the fine legs.

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Uh...

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Don't worry about him.

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
He's off to make
the arrangements.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
Arrangements?

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
Come now, what do
you mean "for what"?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
Why, isn't it utterly
and completely obvious?

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
By "arrangements,"

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:52.183 position:50% align:center
the only thing I could
mean is a helicopter.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
And without much further ado,

00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
I was unwittingly
whisked away...

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
...to the same beach where
I had seen that fateful star...

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
...ten long years ago.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
However...

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
What kinda middle school
kids ride a helicopter?!

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
Now that we're here,
let's begin...

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
Tell men what
area of the night sky

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.000 position:50% align:center
was this star that
you're looking for?

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
In this case, we can
also use the exact time

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
you observed the star.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Well, considering that the trip

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
was to celebrate my birthday...

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
...we were probably out here

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
sometime around
this time of year.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.429 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs]

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
If we find this new star that
Mayumi Dojima's hoping to find,

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
we'll have one
more constellation

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
to look up to at night!

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
Now, if you insist,

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
I will allow you to name it
"Sotoin," after yours truly.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Um, Sotoin?

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
Do you perhaps think more stars
means more constellations?

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Doesn't it?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No!

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
Oh? Is that so?

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.286 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I'm untrained.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
All I have is, well...

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
...aestheticism.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
Aestheticism?

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
I am Manabu the Aesthete,
purely a lover of beauty.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Manabu the Aesthete...

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
And there was
Hyota the Adonis, too.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
I'm Nagahiro the Orator
with the beautiful voice.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
I cannot stand the
thought of you mistaking us

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
for a bunch of boys
who simply <i>look</i> beautiful.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
The true essence of
our beauty, you see,

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
has nothing to do
with our appearance.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I get what he's saying, but...

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Aestheticism and voice aside,

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
aren't beautiful legs
just appearance?

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
So since you're
pretty and you're boys,

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
that's what makes you the
Pretty Boy Detective Club?

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
That alone would never suffice.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy
Detective Club's third rule...

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
...is to be a detective,
of course.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
Surely you remember which way
you were facing that night.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it was the sea?

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
Or was it the mountains?

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
Where were you looking
when you last saw the star?

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
From what I remember,

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
I was playing at
the water's edge...

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center
...like how Mr. Bare-Legs
over there is doing now.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Excellent, excellent.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
With that settled, it's time
to set up the telescope.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
I'll give you a hand, Nagahiro!

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Understood...

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
So I assume I'll be taking
the lead on this one?

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Hey...

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
Get over here and
help me prepare this.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
You don't have to be rude.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
I have a name,
and what are we preparing?

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
Why are you confused?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
You're the one
that said it, right?

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
That your family had
a barbeque ten years ago?

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.917 position:50% align:center
Huh? Did I say that?

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
We swam, we barbequed,
and set off fireworks.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.631 position:50% align:center
That's what I said...

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
But does this mean
they're going to recreate

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
my family's camping
trip that faithfully?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
is Mr. Bare Legs
frolicking around

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
like that part of
the recreation?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Whad'ya know...

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
You are surprisingly helpful.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.023 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I was simply
taught that if you don't work,

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
you don't eat.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Wait a sec!

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
Don't these antiques belong
in a museum or something?

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
They're not really antiques.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
That guy made them himself.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What? He made them?

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] Most of the paintings
and sculptures you saw

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
in the art room are replicas

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.169 position:50% align:center
that he created
with his owns two hands.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
Sosaku the Artiste,
creator of beauty.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Sosaku the Artiste...

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
So, I never realized
you and Sakiguchi

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.354 position:50% align:center
were friends this whole time.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because...

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.816 position:50% align:center
...no one's ever
mentioned it before.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
You really think the
two of us are friends?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.
You gotta be kidding me!

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
You must be the type
that starts clapping

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.825 position:50% align:center
to the beat but doesn't
know when to stop.

00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
We don't even say hi if we
see each other in the halls.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
There's a truce in the art room.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
Even then,
we only really play nice

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
because we're under
the president's watch.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:50.630 position:50% align:center
Without him around, we wouldn't
function as a group at all.

00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
So it's all of you, huh...

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.510 position:50% align:center
I've been wondering, Fukuroi...

00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50% align:center
How serious are
you guys about this?

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean?

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
You guys have gone through
so much trouble

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
to help a stranger like me
even though we've just met.

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
Is this whole "Pretty Boy
Detective Club" thing

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
just some kind
of rich guys' hobby?

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
Like, with the helicopter.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
It feels like you're looking
down on my problems.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's not
a great feeling.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
So, what are you guys?

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
A bunch of eccentric,
privileged students?

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
Did you bring me here
for your amusement?

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
I decided to lay it
all out and be blunt.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
I wasn't very nice about it.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
I don't want your help

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
if you refuse
to take me seriously.

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
I'm not some little toy
you can go play around with.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Tch! Seriously?

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
What kind of bullshit is that?

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
Calling us "eccentrics."

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
We're not pretending.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
This isn't an act.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Now eat this.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
Poison test.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
Wait! Damn!

00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
Why you wasting food?!

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI gasps]
It's so different

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
from the rubbery meat
I usually eat...

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.169 position:50% align:center
My stomach couldn't handle it...

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] That's not something
you should be admitting.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Whoa. What the...?

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
Are you... Are you
actually crying?

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.802 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I am not crying.

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
The juice from
the meat got in my eye.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
That actually really bad!

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Don't worry about me...

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
This is so embarrassing.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
I'm so lame.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
I mean, crying
in front of a guy?

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center
So, uh, you must be
Michiru the Epicure, right?

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
Well, you got that right.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
Why's that funny?

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
I'm not your enemy, ya know.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
I am trying to help you.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
Jeez.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
Mm! Tasty.
Man, I'm good at this.

00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
Hm? What's up?

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
You thinking about
how that was, like,

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
an indirect kiss or something?

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
No, nothing even close to that.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
That was nothing.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
I used to live off of
whatever food I found

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
lying on the ground.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
When it comes to food,

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
it's more important to me
that it doesn't go to waste

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
than anything else.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
[gags]

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Enough of that already!

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Here. Wipe your mouth and tears.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
Look at that idiot.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
The biggest idiot I know.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
He's already
completely forgotten

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
that we're out here
because of your case.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm...

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Even if you asked him

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
to drop the whole
thing right now,

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
he probably wouldn't stop
looking for that lost star.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
That's his way of
taking things seriously.

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
It's his aesthetic.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
If our leader is serious,
