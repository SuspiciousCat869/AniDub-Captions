[phone ringing]

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Oh...

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Miss Dojima,
you are hereby summoned

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.853 position:50% align:center
by the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Please put aside any other plans
and come to the art room.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] The hell do
you think you're going?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
For someone called
Mayumi the Seer,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
you're pretty bad at seeing
your way to the art room.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I saw this
coming a mile away.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.213 position:50% align:center
Now come on, we've gotta
go to the art room.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Not so fast!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
Dammit! How could someone
so somber be so nimble?!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Somber's fine.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
As long as...

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
...I'm free!

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, at least
you tried, Dojima.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
But no matter how
good your eyes are,

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
you're never gonna
see me coming.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
I'm faster than light!

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:32.587 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
But if this meeting's
so important,

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
you guys can go ahead
and start without me.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I don't mind.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Can you stop trying

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
to pretend this
doesn't involve you?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
You're acting like
someone who says,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
"Everyone's always on
their phone these days.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
You never see a single person
reading on the train anymore!"

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
You know, crap like that.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
Well, if you wanna see
someone reading,

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
take out a book yourself!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
How is it that you
still haven't accepted

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
that you're one of us?

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
"One of us."

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
Just then, Fukuroi
served up a fresh batch

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
of the acceptance I'd been
craving for far too long.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
There you all are!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
Took you a while!

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
Michiru, Hyota,
Miss Mayumi Dojima!

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you could make it!

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
So that's it, huh?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
I honestly never
thought I'd see the day

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
we'd finally get around
to renovating the ceiling.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but Sotoin...?

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
Can I assume that
this project of yours

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
is the main reason you
summoned us over so urgently?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
Quite the beautiful reason,
is it not?

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy Detective Club
is going to finish the Art Room!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's happening!

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
The long-awaited renovations
are about to be completed!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
The time has come!

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Oh, man!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
You broke it! You broke it!

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
Sosaku totally
destroyed the art room!

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm...

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
Well, at least that
was some beautiful timing.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
A broken ceiling
means break time.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Hmm...

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hm?

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
That hole there...

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
I was thinking it looks
like a secret passage.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A secret passage?

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
Sounds like the perfect hiding
place for some treasure,

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
doesn't it?

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
Hah. What about you?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
Me? Uh, I don't know.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
There could be anything.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.786 position:50% align:center
Like a rotting corpse,
or a skeleton.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
What, you trying
to scare us or something?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
Y'know, when it
comes down to it,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
a picture's worth
a thousand words.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
It's too dark to see anything.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
Well, darn.
Guess that's that, then.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
Looks like there's
nothing we can do.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we don't have
any flashlights we can use...

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
If only one of us
were small enough,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50% align:center
they could fit through
that tiny hole.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.187 position:50% align:center
It'd be even better if they
could somehow see in the dark!

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Thank's for volunteering.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Hey, Dojima.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
Don't you think these paintings
look kinda familiar?

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
Huh? Familiar?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
Actually, I wouldn't call
them familiar, per se.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
This is something
more akin to déjà vu.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
They're not so much strange
as they are missing something.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Déjà vu?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
Missing something?

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
He was right.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
There was definitely something

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.080 position:50% align:center
about these paintings
that felt left out.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hm?

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
H-Hey, Yubiwa.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
Just a moment, Mayumi Dojima.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
It appears Sosaku
has something in mind.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
This one's Millet's
The Cleaners!

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] It's The Gleaners,
to be precise.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
That one's the scenery
from Fragonard's The Swing,

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
but the people are missing!

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
And that's the background
from Millais' Ophelia,

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.951 position:50% align:center
but where's Ophelia?!

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
And that's Manet's
The Luncheon on the Grass,

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
but it's all grass
and no luncheon!

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
What was missing...

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
were all of the people!

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
Is this a typical way for
painters to hone their craft?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Not once
have I heard of an artist

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
training with
exercise like that.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs]

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.346 position:50% align:center
It's almost as if the
people who were confined

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
in the locked room of
those canvasses decided

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
it was time for
a thrilling getaway!

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Uh...
I don't know about that...

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.188 position:50% align:center
Sure, the canvas
is a locked room.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
But it's right where those
people belong, like their home.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
Sounds less like
a daring escape, and...

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50% align:center
Just what was
the author's purpose

00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
in creating these paintings?

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
And for what reason
did they hide them

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
in the attic in the first place?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
Fortunately for us,
there's no end to the mysteries!

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] But, Sotoin,
we don't have any leads.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
Getting to the bottom
of this seems impossible!

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
Good point.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.715 position:50% align:center
Let's focus our efforts on
a different mystery then.

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A different mystery?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] There's one
piece that's oddly omitted

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.636 position:50% align:center
from the collection.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
The mystery of what's missing
is the perfect puzzle

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
for the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
Where's the one painting
even I know?

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
Where's the most famous
painting in the world?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
Leonardo Da Vinci's ...

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
Mona Lisa.

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO sighs]

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we can use
that fact as a clue

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
to determine the true identity
of the creator of these works.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
How did they go about choosing
which paintings to duplicate,

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.750 position:50% align:center
and why did they choose
these pieces specifically?

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
Find those answers,

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
and we'll be closer to
finding the artist's identity.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
All right.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
It's time to wrap up.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
We'll stop here for now
and call it a day.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Come up with some
theories for homework.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50% align:center
Huh? We can go home already?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
I was beyond grateful
that Mr. Delinquent

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
and Mr. Bare-Legs
decided to walk me home

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
after club duties had ended.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
While I sincerely
doubt anything will happen,

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
we mustn't forget
past incidents.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
You can never be too careful.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
I doubt Kamikazari's gotten

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
over the hand we dealt them,

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.246 position:50% align:center
so they're probably still
licking their wounds.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
There's no way they'll be
messing with us any time soon.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] Yeah, we're pretty much
here just to make you feel safe.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
you prepare for it

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
if you're gonna get kidnapped,

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
you're gonna get kidnapped
and that's that.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's the reason Nagahiro
gave you that cellphone.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
So you can at
least call for help

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
if and when you're
kidnapped again.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Do they really
think it'll happen again?

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
That reminds me.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
When our leader was talking
about the people missing

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
from those 33 paintings,

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
he said it was like they
escaped a locked room, right?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
But wouldn't it make more sense
to say it was like a kidnapping?

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think I get
what you're trying to say.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
If they escaped their paintings,

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
that'd be like they were
escaping their homes, right?

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
But then again, since
they belong in their canvases,

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
it'd make a lot more sense
to say they were taken

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
like they were
abducted or something.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
I don't get it. Gone is gone.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
What's the difference?

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
Whatever, I don't care.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
Try to take
this seriously, okay?

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
This is an assignment
from our leader.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
Oh, and by the way,
you've gotta stop acting like

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
you're still one of
our clients, Dojima.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
I've said it a million times,
but I'll say it again.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
You're one of us now.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A proposal.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
Or as the Detective Club would
probably call it, a theory.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
A beautiful one, at that.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
They'll expect
no less from a member.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
You must be pretty.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
You must be a boy.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
And of course, be a detective...

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Ms. Dojima?

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.419 position:50% align:center
You've probably forgotten
who this is by now, but

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
this is Lai Fudatsuki.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI gasps]

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
All right! Time to
see what kind of theories

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
you all came up with.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
Any volunteers to go first?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] No? Then I'll
go ahead and start us off!

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
Yesterday we concluded
that the 33 paintings

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
we have lined up were
historically significant

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
masterpieces recreated
without people in them.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
But what if that's
not exactly the case?

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
What if...

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
...those paintings aren't
recreations at all?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
And that's the question
behind my theory.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
What if the 33
paintings we found

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
are actually
the original paintings

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
and were created first?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
Meaning the works
of art displayed

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
in museums all over
the world could actually be

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
based on the pieces
we have in this very room!

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No way that's possible.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
An intriguing theory
from our intriguing leader.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
An epic twist
that flips the script,

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
reminiscent of the kind you'd
find in classic mystery novels.

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
Well, of course!
Could you expect anything less?

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my theory
doesn't answer everything.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
Like why the Mona Lisa's
background is missing

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
from the 33 paintings,
but I have an idea...

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
I think the only
logical conclusion

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
to why the Mona Lisa is missing,

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
would be that Da Vinci himself
was a student here once.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.665 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] More like the
only illogical conclusion.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
We can decide
on which theory sounds

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
the most likely after
we've heard everyone else's.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Is it cool if I go next?

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
Sadly, my theory's
more grounded in reality

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
than our fearless leader's was.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
I remember someone had the idea

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
that maybe these copies
were done as an exercise.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
But that one was
shot down pretty quickly.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
And I agree.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a crappy
exercise, if you ask me.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
What would be the point?

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
What if...

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
...they're neither replicas
or for practice?

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] I'm thinking
they're more like parodies.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Or cover songs.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
Like, the originals were
the inspiration and the roots,

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
but the final paintings wound up

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
as something
completely different.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
Interesting. You've taken a
truly unique approach, Michiru.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
[OTHER 4]
Hmmm...

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] However, if they're
like a parody or cover song,

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
shouldn't the great Mona Lisa
be among their number,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
considering it's one
of the "greatest hits"

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
of the art world?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
All right, I'll go next.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
You're gonna like this.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
I decided to focus on
what my eyes could see.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
I asked myself,
if I was the creator,

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
why would I paint
something like this?

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
Just what kind
of demented artist...

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
...would dare remove...

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
...the nude lady from the
painting of a nude lady?!

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
That thought was the
starting point of my theory.

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.117 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's as simple
as the painter realizing

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
they weren't good
at painting people.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
And since they sucked
at painting people,

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
maybe they just
focused their efforts

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
on remaking classic paintings
in a way that was easy for them.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's exactly
what I would do

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
if I were in that situation.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Hmmm...
It's a solid idea.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
His is the first theory
that provides an explanation

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
that covers the mysterious
absence of the Mona Lisa.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
There's one drawback, however.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
It's not a beautiful theory.

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Hey, Dojima!

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.897 position:50% align:center
How about you give us
your theory next?

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Ashikaga theorized that
the reason the creator

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
of these paintings gave up was

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
that they weren't very
good at painting people.

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
But I don't think
that was the problem.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
What if they could paint
people just fine,

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
and it was seeing them
that was the issue?

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
What do you mean they
had issues seeing people?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
Explain.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
Look. Everyone's
eyesight is different, right?

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
I'm the perfect example of this.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
When I take off my glasses,
I see a different world.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
One far different than, say,
the one Mr. Delinquent sees.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Oh?

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Let's see...

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
How did he put it again?

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.561 position:50% align:center
Ashikaga just said

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
he was "focused on
what his eyes could see"

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
when making his theory.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
But a painting based on

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
"what your eyes can see"
would change

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
from person to person.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
In fact, that may be
what marks the fine line

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
between art and fine art.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
I'd go so far as to say that

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
when you look at
historical masterpieces,

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.494 position:50% align:center
you're given
the rare opportunity

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:15.206 position:50% align:center
to see the world through
the eyes of a genius.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
I said something so unlike me

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
that they don't
know what to say.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Hmmm...

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Well, in any case,

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
I believe these were
meant as practice.

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:28.720 position:50% align:center
The artist thought they made

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
an exact replica
of the masterpieces...

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
...except what they
ultimately created

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.809 position:50% align:center
ended up being something
completely different

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
from the original.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
So basically, you're
saying the artist probably

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
had vision kinda like yours,

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
and when they looked
at the originals,

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
they unknowingly were looking
through all the painted people?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure
about your theory.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.533 position:50% align:center
First of all, I seriously doubt
you'd find too many other people

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
with eyesight like yours.

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.496 position:50% align:center
Second, what they would have
seen through wasn't people,

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
but a bunch of paint
on a canvas, right?

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
And even if you could
see through the paint,

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you just be looking
at a blank canvas at that point?

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And how are
you gonna explain

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
why the Mona Lisa
isn't part of it?

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.052 position:50% align:center
Maybe for that one,

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
they not only saw
through the person,

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
but straight through
the background, as well.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
That sounds less like
a detective's theory...

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
and more like the
sophistry of a criminal.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center
How impressive!

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
That was quite well done,

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.820 position:50% align:center
especially since it was your
first theory, Mayumi Dojima!

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
Even if it was sophistry,

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
it was an eloquent,
beautiful sophistry!

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
I do believe it's
Sosaku's turn next!

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Huh?
Yubiwa's also participating?

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
We don't have all the paintings.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
There are at least
33 more in existence.

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
Wait, I don't understand.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
Hey, yeah, I get it!

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
So that's what you mean!

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
Come now, Mayumi Dojima.

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me
you really don't see!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.651 position:50% align:center
Sosaku said we don't
have all of the paintings

00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
and that there are
at least 33 more of them

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.030 position:50% align:center
in existence somewhere.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Right! And that means...?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
That's all there is.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
That's all there is?!

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
But, Sosaku, how many of them

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
do you think there really are?

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
Sosaku says he doesn't
have the slightest idea

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
how many there are.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
There might be a hundred,

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
or maybe more than
a thousand of them.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
I feel like you're
telling us the conclusion

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
without saying
how you got there.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
You got any proof maybe?

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
No proof.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
This theory is based purely
on Sosaku the Artiste's hunch.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
So there's nothing more
he has to say about it for now.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
Yes. That is correct.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
It is indeed my turn.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
But where should
I begin my story...

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
Let's see...

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
I will begin
with the conclusion.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
I have successfully
identified the creator

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
of the paintings from the attic.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
And I have confirmed
the findings for myself.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
The name of the artist
is Kowako Towai.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
An art teacher
who used to teach here

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
at this very academy.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
An art teacher...

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
So when you say "used to,"

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
just how long ago
are we talking about?

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
Seven years ago.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.306 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, Sakiguchi.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
It would probably be
pretty easy to find out

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.102 position:50% align:center
a teacher's name and
how long they worked here

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
with a little research...

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
...but how'd you figure out

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.439 position:50% align:center
that one of the teachers
was the artist?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
A good question.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:32.153 position:50% align:center
I simply gathered my intel
by casually talking up

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
the teachers I work
with on the student council.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I don't know why...

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.578 position:50% align:center
...but that answer sounded vague
for Sakiguchi the Orator.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
And yet,

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
there was something
oddly familiar

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
about the name Kowako Towai

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
that I just couldn't
put my finger on.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
Actually, you know that giant
painting in the auditorium?

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
wasn't Kowako Towai
the one who painted it?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Well, then.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
Let's resume this conversation
in front of that painting.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] It was a
somewhat strange painting.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
"The Auditorium
in the Auditorium."

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
The auditorium in the
auditorium in the auditorium

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
in the auditorium in the
auditorium in the auditorium

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
in the auditorium in
the auditorium in the...

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Lend me your ears!

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
Kowako Towai.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.079 position:50% align:center
Despite having resigned
seven long years ago,

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
Ms. Towai's heavily-whispered
tale can still be heard

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
in the teacher's lounge to this
day--a legend among the faculty.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
While her exploits
are legendary,

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
her legacy is anything
but a positive one.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.384 position:50% align:center
She was eccentric.

00:19:36.468 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
Some would even call
her an oddball.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
There is a slew of examples
of her unusual behavior.

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
Like when she held an art
competition without permission

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
and took her entire class
on a trip overseas

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
for them to participate.

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
Or when she remodeled
the school as she wished,

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:56.654 position:50% align:center
adding doors to nowhere
and secret rooms.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
She even turned
a straight hallway

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
into a twisting labyrinth.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
Despite her strange behavior,

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
she was well-respected
as an artist.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
It was her achievements
in the art community

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
that earned her an invitation
to teach at Yubiwa Academy.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
This enormous painting
was her first undertaking

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
upon accepting
a role at the school.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
When gazing upon this epic work,

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
you can feel the
unconventional exceptionalism

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
of Kowako Towai.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
All that happened
seven years ago.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
Including a
commotion that occurred

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
just as the electives,

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.356 position:50% align:center
particularly art classes,
were being removed.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
Just consider it as
a sign of the times.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
We'll can all worry ourselves

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
with the wisdom of
such a move a bit later.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.489 position:50% align:center
It was the direction
the academy was heading

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
and the decision was final.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
Ms. Towai, however,

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
was vehemently against
the change in curriculum.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
One may see it
as a selfish choice,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
but this is a
tale of selfishness.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
First, they hired
her as a teacher,

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
then as quickly as she arrived,

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
they would let her go
at their own convenience.

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
That would anger anyone.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:02.929 position:50% align:center
However, Ms. Towai didn't
behave as just anyone would.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
Her seeming mistreatment was not

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
why she willingly
put up a fight.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
No, she resolutely asserted

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
that children
were in need of art,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
especially in school.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Ms. Towai didn't yield an inch

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
and continued resisting
the change alone.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center
And through it all,

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
her words grew more
and more threatening.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
Specifically, her
disturbing words grew into

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
a literal threat themselves.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
"Children should
not attend a school

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
that refuses to teach them
the beauty of art."

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
"So if you're going
to go through

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
with your ignorant decision
to change the curriculum..."

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
...I swear that
I'll abduct all of them.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
Every last student
of this school."

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
Those were her words.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
Not just her words,
her criminal proclamation.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
She'd abduct
every last student...?

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
How could such an impossibility
be considered an actual threat?

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
That's just it...

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
She made good on
her unthinkable threat.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
Ms. Kowako Towai...

00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:03.323 position:50% align:center
...abducted every
last student from the school.
