[MAYUMI]
For our episode today,

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.102 position:50% align:center
we bring you
the story of an election.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.353 position:50% align:center
The election to decide

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.522 position:50% align:center
our school's next student
council president.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
But before we begin,

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
I should clarify
one important detail:

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
This particular election
was rigged from top to bottom.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
Until now,
it's been an assumption

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.658 position:50% align:center
that Wana Naganawa being
our current vice-president,

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.952 position:50% align:center
would simply take over,
and until the other day,

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
no one would have disputed that.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
Believe me, as unofficial
spokesperson for kids

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.876 position:50% align:center
who don't care, let's just say

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
I had absolutely
no stake whatsoever

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
in the outcome of this election.

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
Yet there I was.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
Caught staring like
a deer in the headlights.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
Lowly old me--nary
a second year...!

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
By a twist of fate!

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
Called upon to serve!

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.851 position:50% align:center
In other words, I never imagined

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
that I'd be announcing my
candidacy for president...

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.065 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
This is a disaster.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
I mean, you show up for
the first time in how long?

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
And you're immediately in
a bad mood? Come on, man.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid this isn't pretense,
I really am at my wit's end.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
I don't get it

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.245 position:50% align:center
I thought your campaign
was going well,

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
so what the hell changed?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
Y'got all the votes you
need locked in, right?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:25.877 position:50% align:center
With the sole exception
of your group,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.672 position:50% align:center
I'd say everything is more
or less taken care of.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
That's my point.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.759 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem like you've
got anything to worry about.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.970 position:50% align:center
And, anyway, Naganawa's
the only candidate worth a damn.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.180 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Right.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.933 position:50% align:center
And that is exactly
what I'm worried about.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
You see, she was hit by a car,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
and she's been hospitalized.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Wana Naganawa.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
Class 2-A.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.705 position:50% align:center
Attendance number,
I have no idea.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
A-Anyway, she's the Student
Council Vice-President,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
and she's known
as the Snow Queen.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
In a good way, I'm sure.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Fortunately,
her life's not in danger.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
After about a month
in the hospital,

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
she'll be well enough to return,

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
at which point she
can resume her studies.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
A month in the hospital?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.355 position:50% align:center
Wait... But... what'll
she do about the election?

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] That's precisely
why I'm concerned.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Miss Naganawa will be forced
to withdraw her candidacy.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
If that's the case, and
if she's out of the running,

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
then Yubiwa Academy will
undergo a change in regime.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
This can't be allowed to happen.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:06.371 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Okay, but...

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
...it doesn't sound like there's
a lot you can do about that.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Mayumi.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hm?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] The fact that he's
about to step down from power

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
isn't what's bothering
our lolicon here.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
He's frustrated someone else

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
is going to become student
council president.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
How is that any different?

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Basically, if anyone
else wins this election

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
other than Nagahiro's vice
president, Miss Naganawa,

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
there's no way that person
will ever be treated

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50% align:center
like they're on equal
footing with the academy.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Ohhhhh, I think
I understand what you mean!

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
Yubiwa Academy used to
prioritize individuality

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
and freedom, but
with each new year,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
they move away
from that philosophy,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
instead demanding efficiency.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
There's been lots of pushback,

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
but the most vocal opponent

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
is the current Student Council
Executive Department.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
In other words, Nagahiro
Sakiguchi and his council.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.838 position:50% align:center
As far as Mr. Senpai
is concerned,

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50% align:center
having a plan in place
for his retirement

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
goes without saying.

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.843 position:50% align:center
Especially if there's
going to be any hope

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
of maintaining an
equilibrium with the academy.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
That's probably why he decided
to endorse the vice-president,

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.351 position:50% align:center
but who could predict
that all that planning

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
would go right out the window
with a traffic accident?

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
This is a disaster.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO sighs] Miss Naganawa
is upset about this as well.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
Frankly, she is more
distraught over the fact

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
that she has to
withdraw from the race

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
than she is over
the accident itself.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason
you can't just have

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
another member of the Student
Council Executive Department

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
run in her place?

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
If push comes to shove,

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
I expect that's what I'll do,

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
but I can't force anyone's hand.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
Can't force anyone's hand?

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
Are you telling me that your
"Executive Department"

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
isn't obedient to
your every whim?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Such presence... Hmm...

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
That's exactly the reason I
can't force their hands, Mayumi.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
If I were to apply pressure

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
and if any one of
them decided to run

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
for student council
president on my account...

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
If there were another
traffic accident,

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
I'd never forgive myself.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] If there were
another traffic accident?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
"Another"?

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
That makes it sound
like it was intentional.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
As if the only reason
Naganawa got hit by a car,

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
was because she was
running for president.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
Is that kinda thing possible?

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
Have they made any
information available

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
about the driver of the car
that ran over Naganawa?

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
No, it was a hit-and-run.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
The culprit hasn't
been found as yet.

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
A hit-and-run...

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Did anybody there
witness the accident?

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem so the
accident occurred at Hill D.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hill D.

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.487 position:50% align:center
That's one of the four hills
that surround Yubiwa Academy.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
Hill A, Hill B,
Hill C, and Hill D,

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
where the accident happened.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
The letters go by traffic,
and Hill A is the busiest.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
Meaning that Hill D
sees the least activity

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
out of the four of them.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
What about Naganawa?

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
Isn't there a small chance that
she might remember something?

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Hmm...

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, it seems
that she is unable to recall

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
much of the accident.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
In any case,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
as long as that kind of
danger is a possibility,

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
it'll be hard maybe impossible
to find a replacement

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
for Naganawa on
such short notice.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
But we can't just do nothing.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
You can't give in
to the enemy like that!

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
Surely you want to
stop these villains!

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
Of course that is assuming
that such a faction even exists.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Then you shouldn't
allow yourself to falter

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
when things are at their worst!

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
I trust that your
Student Council

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
will throw caution to the wind

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
and proudly declare candidacy!

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
Were I in their place,
I'd do so in a heartbeat!

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
This is what we call,

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
"letting your emotions
get the better of you."

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] I'm glad to hear it.
I was hoping you would

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
say something just
like that, Miss Mayumi.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
If I may, I have a proposition
that may be of interest to you.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
Consider this a Pretty Boy
Detective Club mission,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
assigned by your vice-president.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Uh, what now?

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Nope, no way, not a chance!

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
That would be crazy!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
Wait, is the reason
you're asking

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
because we've
gotten close recently?

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
So I imagine you're beginning
to feel like you can rely on me

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
in a meaningful way,
aren't yoooooou?!

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
No, you're simply the only
underclassman I can think of,

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50% align:center
that I wouldn't mind
being run over by a car.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
Actually, if Mayumi does it

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
and gets run over
in some conspiracy,

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
that's kind of a win-win
if you think about it.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:35.890 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI grunts]

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] Having a
friend you don't mind

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.059 position:50% align:center
letting get hit by a car?

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
Priceless.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
Not that we should
be running over

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
anybody in the first place.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
But speaking practically?

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
I don't think I would
cut it as a candidate.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
Even if I were to put
my name in the hat,

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
it's not like there's anybody
who would vote for me.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
You'll have all
the votes you need

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
after you have my official
endorsement, that is.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't Mr. Delinquent
volunteer himself?

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.915 position:50% align:center
I mean, you are the bossman;
don't you have lots of support?

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.543 position:50% align:center
Let's say we do it,
and Nagahiro backs me up,

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
who the hell is
going to believe it?

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Yeah, fine.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
Okay, how about
Mr. Bare-Legs or Mr. Genius!

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Can't one of them run?

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
Just saying it, I realized
how ridiculous an idea it was

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
for either of them to run.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
After all, the members of
the Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
have no basis for friendship
outside of the art room.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
Actually, our leader is...!

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
Is a fifth grader never mind.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
Cool. I'll get run over.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
But please, if I'm going to die,

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
promise you'll find out who the
"hit-and-run perpetrator" is!

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
Oh my god.
You're not going to die.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
You'll be safe
and sound with us.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] As it stands,
the Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
currently has two
active missions.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
To help make
sure I win the election

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
and to find the "hit-and-run
perpetrator of Hill D."

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The next morning...

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
Ha ha ha!

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50% align:center
I heard what happened,
Mayumi Dojima!

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
Your beautiful spirit
and self-sacrifice

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
never cease to amaze me!!

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Can you please
stop squeezing meee?

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
As one of the athletic members,

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
shall I attach myself

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
and act as her
personal bodyguard?

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
Can we DE-tach for a little?

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
And we can't just sit back

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
and let the police figure out

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
who did the hit-and-run, right?

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
Very good point!

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
Catching them will
be a whole other mission

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
I'll leave that in
your hands, Michiru!

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
And I'll devise
an election strategy.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
How does that sound, Leader?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Mmm!

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Sounds perfect!

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
And, Sosaku, for the time being,

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
we'll have you oversee
Mayumi's crossdressing!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50% align:center
Let's manifest
Mayumi's inner beauty

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
so as to make her undeniable
to all who behold her!

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
All right unless anyone
has any questions,

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
we all know our jobs.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
So how we lookin', Nagahiro?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
Ballpark.

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
Does "Miss Gloomy" over there

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
have a chance in hell
of winning this thing?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
She has a chance, yes.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
However, make no mistake,

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
this will be an
incredibly close race.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
Who is she up against?

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
Judging by the data we
currently have available,

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
her most formidable opponent
will be Yokuya in class 2-B.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
Class 2-B?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that mean that he and I
are in the same class?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
But do we have a
guy named "Yokuya"?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:30.982 position:50% align:center
Does it strike you as weird

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.317 position:50% align:center
that the current top candidate

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
is someone I supposedly
share a class with

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
but can't remember
to save my life?

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Mmm.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
I conducted a little
research of my own.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
However, there was
nothing in particular

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
that stood out about him.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
If anything, it's remarkable
how unremarkable he is.

00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
He hasn't done
anything to campaign,

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
yet he continues
to maintain a lead.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.506 position:50% align:center
Well, one thing
can't be overlooked.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
The fact that he's
now the top candidate

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
because Naganawa's
in the hospital

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
means that for whatever reason,

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
out of everyone in the school,

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
he stood to gain the most
from the accident on Hill D.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
Listen, just to be clear,
this isn't me implying

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center
that your classmate is the same
guy that ran over Naganawa.

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] If you
consciously decide you want

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
to commit a hit-and-run,

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
step one would be getting
your hands on a car.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Apropo of Mayumi's point,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
I find it unlikely a
middle school student

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
would have the means
to procure a vehicle.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
Although...

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
If one student in particular

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
were to become student
council president,

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
there's a possibility
some third party

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
could stand to benefit from it
and that can't go ignored

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
So even if we assume Yokuya's
election campaign is legit,

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
there's a chance someone else
could be pulling the strings.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
Don't start
overthinking everything.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
You're just gonna freak
yourself out and get sloppy.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.897 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
it's more than likely
this is all a coincidence.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Are we finished
with all that complicated stuff?

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
Then let's get to it!

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:04.159 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I guess he's not interested

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
in anything that
isn't beautiful...

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
Today, we will be pretty,

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
we will be boys,
and we will be detectives...

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] ...and we'll be
the best team that we can be.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Even in the worst situation,

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
we have to be the best team.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] As it turned out,
my rival was in class 2-B,

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
and his full name,
is Kinshiro Yokuya.

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it'd
completely slipped my mind.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
Not only his first name
but his last name

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
and, uhh...

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
...that he sat next to me.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You're my rival?

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
Who even are you?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
Tch. Whatever.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
At least, it'll be easy
to spy on you.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
Hiiiiiiiii!

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
I forgot my textbook.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
Yokuya, right?

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if
I peeked off your book?

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA]
Sure...

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Remind me, what was your name?

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
M-Mayumi Dojima?

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA]
Hmm.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Umm... S-Sorry.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
Your voice.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
Are you a girl?

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
Oh... Uh... Yeah...

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA]
Hm. Cool.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
Y-Yeah, it's nice to meet you...

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
He has a short, neat haircut,

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
but it looks
slightly bleached...

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
His uniform has been
done up really carefully

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
And yet his tie is
loose around his neck.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
He's carefully put together
in some places

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
and almost deliberately
sloppy in others...

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
I mean, it definitely
reads as individuality

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
but there's just
something uncanny about him.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
It's like he's a parody
of what a middle school kid

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
is supposed to look like...

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
It's not that
he lacks personality

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
his personality
is his lack thereof.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
He's remarkably unremarkable...

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Nothing in particular
stands out almost by design...

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
What makes someone as
conspicuously inconspicuous

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
as Yokuya decide
to be a candidate

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
for student council president?

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
Also, when he originally
announced his candidacy,

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
what chance did he think
he really had of winning?

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
Still, despite the odds
being so stacked against him

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
that he's somehow built such
a successful campaign overnight

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
is awfully suspicious.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
It's possible that
he's just really ambitious

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
or even really selfish,

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
like he wants to be
student council president

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
just to boost his popularity
and enjoy the pampering.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.384 position:50% align:center
Either way,

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
we're talking someone
with a ton of confidence.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
But him?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
He's not assertive
or charismatic.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
unique about him.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.435 position:50% align:center
Any qualities you'd
expect from a leader

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
are absent in the boy
sitting next to me.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
So what's his deal?

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
Is it me?

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
Ever since I joined up with
the Pretty Boy Detective Club,

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
I've been surrounded
by the extraordinary,

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
and I've let it rub off on me.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
If, as a result, I've been
unintentionally judging

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
my peers just
for being normal kids,

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
then that's a big problem!

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
I've been hung up on
the fact that he looks

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
like a middle school boy,
but why wouldn't he?

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.170 position:50% align:center
He is a middle school boy.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
That's when it occurred to me.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
There's no reason for me to
announce my own candidacy.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
And Mr. Senpai
doesn't need to go

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
to all the effort of endorsing
a new candidate

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.638 position:50% align:center
in place of Miss Naganawa.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
If Yokuya is elected
orrrrrr whoooever else,

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
couldn't we just talk to them?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
Convince them of our
platform, and everyone wins.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
Okay, new plan.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
Rather than compete with him,

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
I could build rapport
with him instead.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
Create a some
positive interactions,

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
and get him over to our side.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.864 position:50% align:center
So as soon as class was over,

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
as thanks for letting me
share his textbook,

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
I thought, why not invite
him out for some lunch?

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:42.002 position:50% align:center
Right before I asked him,
I had second thoughts...

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
Suddenly...

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
Something felt very wrong.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.559 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA sighs]
Well, Mayumi,

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center
if y'ask me, I think it
was really smart of you

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
to follow your instincts!

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Case in point. Me.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
There've been so many times
when I thought, "Hey!

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
Are these guys kidnappers?"

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
'N', yeah, they were
totally kidnappers!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
How many run-ins have
you had with kidnappers?

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, do we
know the circumstances

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
under which Naganawa
was run over?

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I heard that she wasn't able

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
to remember much of anything.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
Michiru's already gone
and looked into that.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.210 position:50% align:center
He may not look it,

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
but as far as detectives go,
he's most definitely our best.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:56.052 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] Here's what we know:
Wana was on her cellphone

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
talking to a
girlfriend at the time,

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
and she was right in
the middle of the crosswalk

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
when a car went
through a red light

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere and hit her.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmmm...

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The accident didn't
have any eyewitnesses,

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
but in a sense, I guess
there was an earwitness...

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
Thing is, if it was heard
through a cell phone,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
there's no way
to know the car model

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
or the license plate number
or the driver's appearance...

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
And somehow,
I don't feel comfortable

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
leaving all of our
sleuthing to Mr. Delinquent.

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mr. Bare-Legs.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Mind if we take a little detour?

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The location in question

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
is an uphill one-way street.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
Come on, really?

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
What the hell are you
two doing around here?

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
You two should head home.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Ha, ha, ha!

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't seem like
there's anybody around!

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
I think we'll be fine!

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Sorry to say, this
has been a waste of time.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
I combed this whole area
from top to bottom;

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
couldn't find a damn thing.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] So this is it, Wana had
been right there in the middle

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
of this crosswalk, and
she was on her cellphone,

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.795 position:50% align:center
talking to a friend
when it happened.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.547 position:50% align:center
Sooo she had to
have been run over

00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
somewhere around here?

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Or maybe here?

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
It's not like there's a
chalk outline on the ground,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
and I don't see any blood
splattered anywhere,

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
so I guess it's hard to be sure.

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but if
she was hit by a car,

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
don't you think it's likely
she'd have been sent flying?

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
If her body was sent flying

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
and slammed into the asphalt,
that would be bad news.

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
She'd be in terrible shape.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
Maybe it was only a tap.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Like the driver hit the brakes
as soon as they saw her?

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
Meaning they might
have had no intent to kill,

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.495 position:50% align:center
making this whole thing
one big accident.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:47.997 position:50% align:center
Whoever it was, decides
they want to scare her,

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
they have no interest
in hurting her,

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
but then they screw up
and hit her anyway?

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
Hey, Leader?

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
Sotoin?

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.821 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Ah, there you are!

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Oh! If it isn't Mayumi Dojima!

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
If you're here too,

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
that can only mean we were
both thinking the same thing!

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
It crossed my mind that
I should try to verify

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
which way the car was
heading when it ran her over!

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Which way the car was heading,

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center
meaning which
direction the car fled.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Since this is a one-way street,

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.428 position:50% align:center
it's safe to assume
that the car went

00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
straight up the
boulevard to the junction.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
But after that did it the
driver turn left or right?

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.812 position:50% align:center
No, those aren't
the only options.

00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
For someone who just
committed a hit-and-run,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
it's just as likely that
they wouldn't think twice,

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
going the wrong way
on a one-way street.

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
Ah! An excellent point!

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
I hadn't even considered

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
hat the driver might
not adhere to traffic law!

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
You're quite the detective!

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.999 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's really not all
that impressive...

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] As you know,
academics is not my forte.

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:18.838 position:50% align:center
My only gift is aestheticism!

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.092 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Our leader smiled

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:24.469 position:50% align:center
and spouted off
his usual catch phrase.

00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
But this time maybe what
he lacked wasn't learning,

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:30.350 position:50% align:center
maybe he just lacked malice.

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
He thought even
a hit-and-run driver

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:34.187 position:50% align:center
who had just run
through a red light

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.815 position:50% align:center
would still follow
traffic signs.

00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:39.984 position:50% align:center
For a case like this, there
won't be a beautiful mystery

00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:42.028 position:50% align:center
or some perfect answer
that will strike a chord

00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:44.823 position:50% align:center
with our leader, not this time.

00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:52.539 position:50% align:center
It was at that moment
that it all made sense.

00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:54.874 position:50% align:center
The reason why Mr. Senpai
has been working so hard

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:59.337 position:50% align:center
to maintain the status quo,
even after his graduation...

00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:00.839 position:50% align:center
Why, he'd even
consider the option

00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:04.217 position:50% align:center
of appointing someone as petty
as me to be his successor.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.137 position:50% align:center
Why, he continues to be
so patient and stubborn

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.889 position:50% align:center
as he negotiates day
after day with an academy

00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.349 position:50% align:center
that doesn't want to listen.

00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:17.272 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] It's him. It's so
when this leader of ours,

00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:21.359 position:50% align:center
this boy, a boy who's
still only in fifth grade,

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.445 position:50% align:center
enters middle school...

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.449 position:50% align:center
