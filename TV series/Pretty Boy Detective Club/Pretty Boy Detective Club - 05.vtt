This whole thing's a--!

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
Don't go making
a scene, you idiot.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
Chill.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
B-B-B-B-B-But, Mr. Delinquent...

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
Mr. Delinquent?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
Oh so that's how you see me!

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
You think I'm
some kinda hoodlum?

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.244 position:50% align:center
Mr. Delinquent,
"the two-bit thug"?

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
This is neither the time nor
place for us to get into that!

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
He's cheating!
This is just one big con!

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
Mr. Delinque--!

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
I mean, Fukuroi!

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
I swear I see it!

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.297 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay, I get it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
I'm not doubting you.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.510 position:50% align:center
No one here's calling
you a liar, not for a second.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
when you find yourself
surrounded by hornets,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
the last thing you want
to do is kick the nest.

[HYOTA]
Hey! Check it out!

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
It looks like
lolicon's going in big!

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
Ho, ho.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
A beautiful all-in.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] You didn't have
to be a poker expert

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
to tell who came out on top

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
when all the cards
were put on the table.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
Even with my lack
of poker knowledge,

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:33.093 position:50% align:center
it was obvious who
held the winning hand.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
To put it simply,

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.638 position:50% align:center
the Reasonable Doubt
Casino's manager

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
added another victory
to his winning streak.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your patronage.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
We very much look forward

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
to you gracing
our halls once more,

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
members of the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
That was a scam.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs]

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.252 position:50% align:center
Sounds just like
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
So the stagehand
was wearing clothes

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
that made them
invisible to everyone...

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.008 position:50% align:center
And only Mayumi Dojima was able

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
to accurately see through
to their existence...

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Not exactly.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
To be frank,

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
I knew something was amiss
from the very start.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
I predicted early on
that they would attempt

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
to swindle me in some capacity.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50% align:center
Care to share your theory
with us, Nagahiro?

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
But of course.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
Now, where should
I begin my explanation...

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
From the beginning, where else?

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Start from the top,
and go in order.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
I guess I have no other choice.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
Lend me your ears!

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
The investigation
I now present to you

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
was not conducted as a member

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
of the Pretty Boy
Detective Club,

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
but was done as Yubiwa Academy's
student council president.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
Every corner of our school
was steeped in rumors

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
regarding the happenings
at Kamikazari Middle School.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
And so, I decided to look
into the matter myself.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
But no matter how far I dug,
I failed to find gold.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50% align:center
The students of that school
were strongly united.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
They proved to be
a tight-lipped lot.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
Not a single one would talk.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.076 position:50% align:center
You can imagine how
perplexing this was

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
for someone like me,
considering my gift for gab.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
That being said,
Kamikazari Middle School

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
wasn't always so secretive.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
For better or worse,
back when I was a first-year,

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
the students over there seemed
to be far less inhibited

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
and were a lot less restricted.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
But ever since he enrolled,

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
all information about the school
has become heavily regulated

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
for both better and for worse.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
And "he," of course,
is Fudatsuki.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
Despite the fact that
he only recently

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
became student
council president,

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.903 position:50% align:center
his influence, or
should I say his charisma,

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
was already on full display

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
when he first
entered the school.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
his entrepreneurial mind
was apparent from the start.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
Kamikazari itself became
his central enterprise.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
One led by a
middle school student

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
who used his classmates
as his main staff.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
And so, of course,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
the entirety of
Kamikazari Middle School

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
fell under his thumb in no time.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
It's just as Miss Dojima
already realized.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
The two of us have met before...

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
But on equal ground as fellow
student council presidents.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50% align:center
So I know exactly the type
of person Fudatsuki is.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
And he is by no means
the type to be satisfied

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
with taking over
a single school.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
He's far too ambitious for that.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
No, I have long feared
the day he would set out

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
to wrest control
from other schools.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Earlier, when Miss Dojima
was describing

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
this "Mr. Businessman" to us,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.292 position:50% align:center
I realized that
the time had finally come.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
At long last...

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
Fudatsuki was stalking
a new prey.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
Our school, Yubiwa Academy,
was finally in his sights!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
Nearly everything about
Fudatsuki makes sense...

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
But that still
doesn't explain...

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
...exactly what
all of that was about.

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
Not even Sakiguchi
sensed what was happening.

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
So was it something
beyond his expectations?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Actually...

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
That was fully
within my expectations.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
Do you remember
the Twenties, by chance?

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Wait, the Twenties?

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
Did Mr. Lolicon just
mention "the Twenties"?

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
I did say "the Twenties,"

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
but I am no "Mr. Lolicon,"
thank you very much.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
Does this mean

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
I'll get to see
that Miss Rei again?!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
What a beauty!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
What a scantily clad beauty!

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
You won't see her.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
In fact, we should avoid her.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:08.928 position:50% align:center
I have been contemplating on how

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
we can keep our distance
from the Twenties.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
Or if it would even be
possible on our part to do so.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA moans]

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
A-hem! All right, Nagahiro.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Explain to us the relationship

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
between the Twenties and
the Reasonable Doubt Casino.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.528 position:50% align:center
It was just the other day,
when we successfully--

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
No, more so when we fortuitously
fended off the Twenties.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
But I didn't think
we would be so fortunate

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
if we were to ever
encounter them again.

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.706 position:50% align:center
So I decided to ask
Sosaku for his assistance

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
in performing
an investigation into Rei

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
and her slippery syndicate.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
What did you find out?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Simply put,
the Twenties are transporters.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
Be it people or items,

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
it's their job to transport
anything you desire

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
wherever you desire it to be.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Oh...

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Also...

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
While on the case,
we just so happened

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
to come across quite the
unexpected piece of information.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
Fudatsuki,
Kamikazari Middle School's

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
student council president,

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
left some breadcrumbs revealing
his dealings with the Twenties.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
His dealings?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
You mean all those
slot machines and poker tables?

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
That's precisely right.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
But we discovered something
even more dastardly.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
A certain privately funded
company has entrusted him

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
with an in-development product.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
It seems he's testing said
product in a live environment

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
and getting paid
handsomely for it.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
President Fudatsuki's
main source of income appears

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
to be from gathering
data from these tests

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
and reporting his thoughts
to the company.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.815 position:50% align:center
So his main income's
from reviewing products?

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Like saying if he
thought it worked well or not?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:47.819 position:50% align:center
You can run an entire casino

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
with money made from that?

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Actually,
the money he makes from that

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
is why he's running the casino.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
And so, the product
Fudatsuki was trusted with,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
the one that he's
currently testing out,

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
is what Miss Dojima described
as the stagehand's clothing.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
An invisible black outfit.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The darkness
had been brought to light.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
Everything was for
that invisible black cloak.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
From the casino's
gambling hall...

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
to the stage and
its captivated audience.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
All one giant experiment,
a test of its abilities.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
Except...

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.484 position:50% align:center
D-Does does such
clothing actually exist?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
It sounds like something

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
straight out of a
wild fantasy novel.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.781 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] When your
so-called "Mr. Businessman"

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
disappeared into thin air,

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
it's highly likely he
was using such a cloak.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
Okay, but

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.706 position:50% align:center
the development of a product
that's basically future tech

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
would definitely be a
trade secret, wouldn't it?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.091 position:50% align:center
[SOSAKU] No decent person would
take part in such a scheme.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
Because the developers
have a corrupt and vile cause.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Invisible clothes
straight from a fantasy novel

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
used for a vile cause?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
While criminals could benefit
greatly from such a thing,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
I doubt that's what he meant.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
No, the most likely
place cloaking technology

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.403 position:50% align:center
would be used is
on the battlefield.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
For military use.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
That bastard.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
He's nothing but a dog licking
the boots of the arms industry.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
What a disappointment.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.583 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] It's unlikely he
shares your view on the matter.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.752 position:50% align:center
He probably thinks of himself

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
as an aggressive negotiator
going toe-to-toe.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, he's dangerous.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Don't doubt that.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
So, what's the plan, Leader?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm... What's the plan?

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Are you asking if
we should once again

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.355 position:50% align:center
make our way to the
Reasonable Doubt Casino

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
to seek revenge with hearts
filled with vengeance?

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
If we should put all
our efforts into winning

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
that on-stage challenge against
the manager and wrest control?

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
If we should decimate the place

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
where he's been testing
those black clothes

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
before they can
be used in an act of war?

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.581 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're asking?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
then my answer is a yes.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
How could I say no to that?

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
In fact, doing
anything else now

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
would just go
against my aesthetic.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
To not act on beauty
would only be cowardice!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dojima!

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.265 position:50% align:center
No, Mayumi the Seer!

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes?

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
You may rejoice.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:29.022 position:50% align:center
The time for us to use your
vision has finally arrived!

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Sotoin's plan was for us

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
to infiltrate the
Reasonable Doubt Casino.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Not as invited guests,
but disguised as staff members.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
That way, we could come and go
as we please without concern...

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
...and have all the access
we would ever need

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
to do our detective
work under the radar.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
Plus, we would
need no invitations.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
Well, not exactly
no invitations.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
While five of us provided back
up as staff members...

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
one of us would
have the dubious honor

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
of facing off against
the manager on stage.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Ahem!

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
Who else could it be but me?

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Seriously?!

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, dear patron!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
Ho ho!

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.968 position:50% align:center
Let the games begin!

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] It had been 30 minutes
since Sotoin and Fudatsuki

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
took the stage for their
blackjack showdown...

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
But for some reason...

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
...the invisible stagehand
had yet to appear.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
You sound distressed.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
Is everything all right?

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
I-I think they might've
found out about us.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
They're being a lot more
careful about their cheating.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look like

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
they're even using
a stagehand this time.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
If that's truly the case,

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
you could say it's
a good turn of events.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
If Fudatsuki won't be able to
pull off his usual shenanigans,

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
our leader may actually
have a legitimate chance

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
of winning against him.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE Ohhs]

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Their debate played out;

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
the chips flowing back
and forth with each argument.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
Every play so perfect,
it was as if it were scripted.

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
[CROWD]
Awww...

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
You really don't see
anything, Miss Dojima?

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.000 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I can't see what I can't see.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
And here I thought
I had finally found

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
a just use for my eyesight...

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
Calm down... Calm down...

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
The way it's going...

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
...doesn't look good.

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Just what kind of
trick is Fudatsuki pulling?

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
How is he able
to get past my sight?

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
Impossible...

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
[MANABU laughs]

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
What, pray tell, is so funny?

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
Oh no, it's nothing like that.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.128 position:50% align:center
You've simply forced me
into a corner, that's all!

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
And the tighter the spot I'm in,

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
the more beautifully
radiant I become!

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
It's almost tragic
to be this pretty.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
You seem rather passionate
about the idea of beauty.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.683 position:50% align:center
But take heed, miss.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
Your preoccupation
with such a thing

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
may one day cause you to lose
your balance and slip up.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
Consider Saint-Exupéry's
famous quote--

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
"What is essential
is invisible to the eye."

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
This sentiment can also
be said of what's beautiful.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
For beauty itself is
as ethereal as the air

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
and cannot be seen
by the eye alone.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
I won't slip up and
be taken off balance.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
In fact, my feet have
always been firmly planted.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
I'm no stranger
to Saint-Exupéry.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
I, too, have analyzed that
particularly elegant passage.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
And I was very moved
when I saw those words.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
However, I have to disagree.

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
That which is essential
is not invisible to the eye.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
If something were
truly beautiful,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
it would not pass
through this world unseen.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
Be it something
external or internal,

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
a well-written phrase
or a winter wind,

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
I will undoubtedly bare witness.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
No matter how
blinding its radiance,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.656 position:50% align:center
I swear to never avert my gaze.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
That's because to do otherwise
would not do beauty justice.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
Fudatsuki, if even your
lies hold beauty within,

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
you'll find my eyes firmly
transfixed upon them.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Sotoin's declaration...

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
...was one of war.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
The audience, of course,
was not amused,

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
and sat silent as
they watched the stage.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.886 position:50% align:center
In that absence of sound,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
the applause from four pairs of
hands echoed across the venue.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
It was time to settle
the score right then and there.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
Come on, Mayumi.

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Think! THINK!

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Think, think,
think, think, think!

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
There's got to be something
I'm overlooking!

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.406 position:50% align:center
Something that's staring me
straight in the eye

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
that for some reason
I'm failing to recognize!

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
What am I avoiding?

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.289 position:50% align:center
I knew the answer

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
without having to think.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.876 position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.964 position:50% align:center
I had to take a look at myself
in a way only I could.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
And I became a member

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
of the Pretty Boy Detective Club
to do just that.

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
Mayumi the Seer.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
That's what they called me.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
Is that me?

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.061 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
It is.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
But that's not all I am.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
It's my strength,
maybe even my beauty.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
But it's also my weakness,

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
a flaw giving me
a sense of inferiority.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
There's a part of me
that can't see past it...

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
A part I'm ignoring,
and pretending isn't there.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
I'm going to confront
myself dressed as a bunny.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
There was nothing strange

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
about being a
bunny girl in a casino.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
In fact, I wasn't the only one.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
It was completely natural.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
Then, what was unnatural?

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
Of course...

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
Being in a casino,

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
yet having little understanding

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
of how any of the games worked
or what their rules were.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
Poker rules, roulette rules,

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
baccarat rules,
slot machine rules,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
and blackjack rules.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
to play any of them,

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
yet here I am in a casino.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
natural about that.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
I failed to confront
that part of me.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
I haven't even tried
to learn the rules.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
Some sights can't be
seen without context.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.085 position:50% align:center
And some scenes are
hidden from plain sight.

00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
What if the problem wasn't
that I couldn't see it,

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
but that I could see it,
but didn't realize it was there?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakiguchi...

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
When playing blackjack,

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
can the dealer exchange cards
whenever they want,

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
but the other players can't?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Is that a rule?

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Once I figured it out,

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.444 position:50% align:center
I was disgusted by
the simplicity of the trick.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
He was using an
infuriatingly obvious cheat.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
The unseen stagehand
in a black outfit...

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.912 position:50% align:center
I was so surprised by that one,

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.038 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't help but assume

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.249 position:50% align:center
it was the only way
he'd try to cheat.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
It worked so well, after all,

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
so why even try
a different method?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
But trick cards you can't
see while they're face down,

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
but that become
visible once flipped over?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
They were stealth cards,
hidden in plain sight...

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.680 position:50% align:center
until the dealer
was ready to use them

00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
and decided to turn them over.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
They were right in front
of me the whole time.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:07.272 position:50% align:center
But once I had
the scam figured out,

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.316 position:50% align:center
there was no need
for me to hold back.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
I had to stop it!

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] The Reasonable Doubt
Casino decided

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:21.411 position:50% align:center
to close its doors after
the events of last night.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] The time for
fun and games is over.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.374 position:50% align:center
Please make your exit
in a beautiful manner.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] We succeeded
in thwarting the experiment.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
And with the knowledge
that someone

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
with eyesight like mine existed,

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
their development
of invisibility clothes

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
and cloaking
technology in general

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
may be forced
to return to square one.

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
Even so,
we weren't able to sever

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
the connection between
Kamikazari Middle School

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
and the Twenties.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
And so, the root of
the problem still remained.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:51.983 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
Good morning, Mayumi Dojima.

00:19:58.782 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
I am not here
for some petty revenge.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
O-Okay...

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
Only to deliver a love letter.

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
It's not a letter
from me, though.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
It's from our little bunny.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.214 position:50% align:center
[LAI] I'll gladly keep your
gender a secret from her,

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
so if you're okay with it,
please give her a call.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50% align:center
One more thing,

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
please send my kind
regards to that lovely girl

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
who shared that beautiful
lecture on aesthetics...

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
I cannot wait

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
to go another round
with her someday.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.939 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I had a feeling
the real reason he was here

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
was to deliver his regards
for our "lovely girl."

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
Which reminds me I don't think

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
you've ever told me
what your full name is.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Would you mind?

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
[LAI]
It's Lai.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
Lai Fudatsuki.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Written with the character
for "lie" and read the same.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
If you ever need assistance,

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
I'd gladly provide consultation.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to help out.

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Maybe if you
took off those glasses,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
you'd clearly see I'm not
such a bad guy after all.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
Well, until next time.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Hey! Hold on!

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
I reflexively gave chase
as he turned and walked away.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.685 position:50% align:center
What--?

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
I immediately
took off my glasses

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
so I could see him clearly,
as suggested,

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
and searched for any sign
of that invisible black outfit.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
However...

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What the...?

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
Even without my glasses,

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
even after straining my eyes,

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
what I saw didn't change...

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
I couldn't see Fudatsuki
clearly, after all.

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:36.046 position:50% align:center
Like a thief in the night, like
the wind itself, Lai Fudatsuki

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
had completely disappeared.

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
"What is essential
is invisible to the eye."

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
In the end,

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
he still had something
"essential" hidden from view.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
One more ace up his sleeve;

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
a trump card for his finale.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.811 position:50% align:center
The showdown between
aesthetics and fraud...

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
The conflict between a boyish
heart and a playful spirit...

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
The clash of the detective club
and the manager

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
was only starting to ramp up.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.697 position:50% align:center
The true battle was yet to come.
