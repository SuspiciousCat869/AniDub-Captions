WEBVTT

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:54.959
[yawns]

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.834
Such an unflattering posture,
maidservant.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.166
[MAYUMI gasps]
Huh?

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.417
[MAYUMI giggles]
Well, that's not very polite.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.709
You should be more respectful
and watch your language.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.625
Otherwise, you'll get censored!

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.041
Pathetic.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.166
And I hear you're going around

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.417
calling me stuff like <i>zashiki-</i>
<i>warashi</i> and <i>yokai</i> , too, huh?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.125
[MAYUMI]
Who told her?!

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:21.166
Is our student council
president pitting Kodaki and I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.083
against one another without
warning in some kind of attempt

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.750
to help nurture a
friendship between us?

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.917
Huh?
What's the matter, troglodyte?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.375
Why are you staring
at me like that?

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.250
Y'got something you
wanna say to me or what?

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:35.583
Something I want to say to you?

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.166
Well, that <i>hagoita</i> of
yours was nice work!

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.667
Did you make it yourself?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.250
How'd you put it
together, anyway?

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.583
Oh, and while you're at it,

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.417
can you tell me how you
got it into the art room?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.041
[KODAKI]
<i>Hagoita</i> ? Huh?

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:47.417
What even is that?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.125
[MAYUMI] Tch! Welp.
She didn't fall for it.

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.166
[MAYUMI] Did you come here
by yourself, Yurika?

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.625
[KODAKI]
What the hell is a "Yurika"?

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.208
Oh, I mean, well,

00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.834
it's just that you have such
a graceful way of walking!

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.792
As the saying goes,
you "walk like a lily"!

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:04.000
[gasps]

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.375
What the hell?
What kind of reaction was that?

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.125
[KODAKI]
Fine.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.792
I take back what I said
about your unflattering posture.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:12.667
[MAYUMI]
Wait a minute.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.792
Wasn't Kodaki the one

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.625
who actually started
this conversation?

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.875
Did she come looking for me

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.792
because there's something
she wants from me?

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:19.750
Huh?

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:21.166
I don't want anything.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.792
Don't act so conceited, whore.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.250
The only reason I'm here
is to look you in the eyes.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.417
[MAYUMI]
Excuse me?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
When you got in
my way yesterday,

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.417
it didn't occur to me that
I was facing the newest flunky

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.291
to join the
Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.208
Tch. Is it really so great

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.959
that you want to cross-dress
to be a part of it?

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.959
Do you enjoy being
surrounded by well-groomed

00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:41.709
and handsome guys
who pamper you?

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:43.041
Are you proud of yourself?

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:43.959
[MAYUMI]
Uh...

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:45.959
Is that how it comes across?

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.333
Tell Manabu, I don't want
that stupid <i>hagoita</i> .

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.125
So just throw it away.

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:51.709
Then die.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:03.750
[MAYUMI] Why did our leader
refuse Kodaki's request

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:05.250
to join the club?

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.208
There has to be a reason.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.458
[gags]

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:23.125
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah...

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.291
[NAGAHIRO] I'd like you
to repeat this exercise

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:27.625
three times, every morning
and every night.

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:30.291
Now then, I suppose we should
head over to the art room?

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:33.041
Oh, Mayumi, did you have
an opportunity to work

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:35.208
on the homework that
our leader gave you?

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:36.500
It's a work in progress!

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:38.417
So, how did things go
on your end?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.792
Well...

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:42.041
My first inclination was
to visit her at her home,

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:43.500
but I'm afraid
she wasn't available

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.542
to speak with me face-to face.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:47.500
So, I attempted
to reach her by phone,

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:49.417
but that proved to be fruitless.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.834
She is, after all,
only a first-grader.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.041
You see our phone time
is restricted,

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:55.208
so for the most part,

00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:57.375
it ended up being
a conversation in text.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.834
Even then, she stopped
responding to me at ten PM.

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.750
Well, if it helps, I just
saw her out in the hallway.

00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:04.875
[gasps]

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.834
Why didn't you say
this to me earlier?

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:09.417
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.750
Exactly what kind
of girl is she?

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:13.250
And what happened between her

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.041
and the Pretty Boy
Detective Club that caused

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.417
such an ordeal this past summer?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.125
[NAGAHIRO]
Hmph.

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:21.417
Forgive me,
I imagine it's felt as if

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.667
we've been intentionally keeping
you in the dark about it.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.458
That ends now.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.375
As I am having you become
Miss Kodaki's first friend,

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.875
I suppose I can stay
silent no longer.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.542
[MAYUMI] Become the
demon's first friend?!

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:38.667
[NAGAHIRO]
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:44.208
Now then where shall
I begin this story?

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.875
I'll start with Miss
Kodaki Kawaike's ancestry.

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:49.750
When I first met Miss Kodaki,

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.750
she was a lovely girl
with a graceful demeanor,

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:55.333
who could be called a
"little lady" in every respect.

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:56.709
I hope that by
clarifying things,

00:05:56.792 --> 00:06:00.250
we can put to rest any
misunderstandings you may have.

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:01.750
From my perspective,

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:04.959
this is no matter how you
look at it an arranged marriage

00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:08.250
in which my consent
was irrelevant.

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:11.875
She is nothing more than a
fiancée that my parents chose.

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.667
This is rather tragic for
Miss Kodaki, in particular.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.000
Sadly, the life
she was born into

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:21.041
has nothing to do with why
she is so caustic to others

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:22.875
and why she behaves
as if everyone around her

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:24.417
is beneath her.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.000
In fact,
the venom that she spews

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.834
is neither the product
of pride nor prejudice,

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.667
but something else entirely.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.542
You see the Kawaike family
had diminished

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.583
long before Kodaki
was old enough

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.750
to remember anything.

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:41.583
I hesitate to frame it this way,

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.000
but in a sense,

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:46.667
she is what you might
refer to as "fallen nobility."

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.291
Incidentally, the kimono
you've seen her wearing

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.250
is something of
an heirloom to her.

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.458
A memento of her late mother

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:55.000
who passed away
after a harrowing decline

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:57.250
and a reminder of her nobility.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:58.709
And so, from a young age,

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:01.291
she shouldered that burden
fearing that at any moment,

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.208
her family could
lose everything.

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.709
The Kawaike family is
an old and honorable one,

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.250
steeped in "tradition."

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:09.166
Were their house to fall,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.375
it would become troublesome,

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:12.458
and not just for the family

00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:15.333
but for society as a whole.

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:17.166
When a giant corporation fails,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.583
helping hands arrive
from a variety of sources,

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:22.542
as to avoid a chain reaction
of bankruptcies.

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:23.875
It was in a similar manner,

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:26.834
that the Kawaike family
managed to survive.

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:29.375
The source of their
salvation came in the form

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:32.834
of a matrimonial relationship
with the Sakiguchi family.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.917
So there's not a shred of
romantic feelings between us,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.500
a far cry from the
mockery I've endured

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:40.250
regarding a "Lolita complex."

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.041
It was nothing more than
a traditional marriage

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:45.000
of convenience between families.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.709
Could I not have refused?

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.166
Heh, perhaps,
but I understood the severity

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.041
of the situation they're in.

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.667
If the Kawaike family manages

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.417
a resurgence before
I turn eighteen,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.250
then the entire concern is moot.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:58.542
While I value humility,

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.583
I know I've led a blessed life.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:01.792
And thus, I felt
that helping others

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:04.709
was a part of my responsibility.

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:07.000
That was a grave mistake.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:08.583
It turned out I was
not the only one

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:12.208
harboring a strong sense
of familial obligation

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.083
Miss Kodaki had
convinced herself

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:17.166
that everything was
resting on her shoulders.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.917
I'm sure you can imagine how
things unfolded as a result.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.583
Her passionate approaches
began and as such,

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.083
she became a distraction,

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:28.041
not only to my private life,
but to the student council.

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:31.834
And that brings us to the
"ordeal" from this past summer.

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.250
Indeed.

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:37.166
I'm referring to our club's
summer training camp.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.083
It was becoming a nightmare
to try and schedule.

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:42.208
As I am not, in fact, a lolicon,

00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.250
I tried to prioritize the
training camp above all else,

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.709
but it seems fate had
something else in mind.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:51.083
For the demon had no
intention of allowing it.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.709
For a girl trying to
preserve her family name,

00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:56.542
the Pretty Boy Detective Club
that captured my attention

00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:59.709
must have seemed to her
more like an evil syndicate.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:02.834
That said, Miss Kodaki did not
at first oppose the club,

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.667
as she did in the end.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.208
At the outset,

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:09.250
it was her intention to join
the Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.083
And if our vacation
plans clashed,

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:12.709
to her,
the solution was simple:

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:15.583
she would just accompany
me on our trip instead.

00:09:16.917 --> 00:09:19.208
Yet, as I'm sure
you've already guessed,

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:21.542
that plan would
never come to pass.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:25.542
Our leader refused her,
it was barely a conversation.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.208
Still for my part,

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.875
I didn't think anything of
the decision at the time.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:31.458
In our defense,

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:34.000
we are quite literally called
the "Pretty Boy Detective Club."

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:35.375
That women would
not be considered

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:39.375
for membership just struck us
as a matter of course.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:40.917
Yet, shortly thereafter,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.291
your own request
to join us was accepted.

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.083
What then had changed?

00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:48.083
Was it your willingness
to cross-dress for us?

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:50.458
If that were truly all
that stood in her way,

00:09:50.542 --> 00:09:52.875
what she did would
be unforgivable.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.583
However, that said,
there's no room for sympathy.

00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:59.834
Alas after her bid for
membership was shot down,

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:03.375
Miss Kodaki decided to take
matters into her own hands.

00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:05.959
Although, I presume
this needs little mention;

00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:08.750
you're aware of her
ability to move silently?

00:10:08.834 --> 00:10:10.208
That she can walk
without footsteps

00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.250
like a ghost as
she did with you,

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:15.417
the first time you
encountered her.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.709
In a manner much like that,

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:19.375
she paid our leader a visit.

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:21.375
She approached
undetected in the stairwell

00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:24.041
of the elementary
school building,

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:26.583
and she shoved him from behind.

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:29.375
He was sent tumbling
down the stairs.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:34.375
Fortunately, our leader was
spared any serious trauma.

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:37.417
He did however sustain
an injury to his foot.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.792
There was little choice;

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:41.333
the summer training camp
was cancelled.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:44.375
Naturally, our leader covered
for Miss Kodaki and told us

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:47.458
that his foot slipped so
as to spare her the shame.

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:49.500
Still, she must have
reflected upon her actions

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.208
and realized she'd gone too far.

00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.750
From that day on,

00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:55.959
she never approached the Pretty
Boy Detective Club again...

00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.709
...till yesterday.

00:10:57.792 --> 00:11:00.250
[MAYUMI]
Yesterday? For real?

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:01.667
[NAGAHIRO]
Yes.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.792
There is no doubt that the
appearance of a new member

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.250
and that fact it's you,
in particular,

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:07.375
has triggered Miss Kodaki.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.917
That is why I have
this ridiculous hope

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.542
that everything can be mended

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.834
if you were to become
a friend to her.

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:16.208
[MAYUMI]
I see, it all makes sense.

00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:19.834
As I let the truth of
Kodaki's story sink in...

00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:22.417
...and pored over
every detail in my mind,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.834
I began to understand.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.667
To understand...

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:30.041
[NMAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:32.333
...that this girl is bad news.

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:34.625
If anything, my sense that
she's nothing but trouble

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:36.375
has been validated.

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:37.542
Don't get me wrong.

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:39.625
I understand her
foul mood has its reasons,

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:42.125
and it stems from a
complicated inferiority complex

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:43.667
regarding her family.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.208
But that doesn't mean
her rotten behavior

00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.500
should be forgiven

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.333
and I wasn't really
moved by her story.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.959
Unfortunately, for you, Yurika,

00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:52.834
I can be kinda petty.

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:56.000
No, it's precisely due
to your tendency to be petty

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:57.166
that I was certain
that you would make

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.500
an excellent first
friend for Miss Kodaki!

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:02.125
I can't help but delight at
the thought of your friendship!

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:04.625
Y-You're supposed to
say that I'm not petty...

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:06.959
Anyway, I get why the
demon wasn't allowed

00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:09.375
to join the club, but I'm
not real sure I understand

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.792
why I was allowed.

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.875
You made it sound like
you were so certain before,

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.959
so what made you
change your mind?

00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.750
Unclear and I never
brought it up

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:19.709
with our leader to get
his thoughts either.

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:23.375
But I have no doubt
he has his reasons.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.500
[MAYUMI]
Oh, yeah...

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.208
Regarding Kodaki's motive,

00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.583
I've been thinking
about why she might have

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.125
brought that <i>hagoita</i>
into the art room...

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:32.291
Do you think there's a chance

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:35.208
it's because she
wanted it returned to her?

00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:37.083
Ahh... How childish.

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.417
It's a ploy to establish
a fait accompli.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.625
She delivers an item into
my care that I must return

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.834
so that I give it
to her like a gift.

00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:46.792
[MAYUMI]
How exactly is that childish?

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:49.709
If I recall, sending
a <i>hagoita</i> is a tradition.

00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:51.625
It's intended to honor
the first new year

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:53.125
after a baby girl is born.

00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:55.500
By sending one to Sakiguchi,

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:57.542
is there an implication
that when he returns it to her,

00:12:57.625 --> 00:13:00.083
he'll be like "well we
already have this thing,

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.166
we might as well
make it a reality"?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.083
And if entrapment
is a part of her plan

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.667
as a means of securing
her future with him,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.959
that's a level of maliciousness

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:10.625
that I would hardly
call childish.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.834
[MAYUMI] Our morning meeting
proceeded with everyone

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:16.583
presenting theories that
were pretty much on-brand.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.834
Sotoin proposed a scenario
that was utterly ridiculous.

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:23.166
Then Mr. Bare-Legs presented
his brute-force theory...

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.834
Mr. Genius didn't say
a word the entire time.

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:30.291
And let's just say that
Mr. Delinquent tried his best.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:31.250
However...

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:33.125
Before I could present my idea,

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:34.959
I was interrupted...

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:37.083
[MICHIRU] Am I the only
one who's bored here?

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:38.625
We're wasting time
making up stories

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:40.500
about how that thing got in here

00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:43.417
instead of sitting her down
and interrogating her.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:46.458
[NAGAHIRO]
As I've said,

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:48.166
it would be wise to
determine the precise mode

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.500
of transport first.

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:51.208
That way, she's left with
no room to make excuses

00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:52.792
when we confront her.

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.500
[MICHIRU] It's not
gonna make a difference.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.625
Even if we do all the legwork
and show her irrefutable proof,

00:13:57.709 --> 00:13:59.792
you know she's just gonna
deny the whole thing.

00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:02.834
She's not gonna confess,
and she's not gonna repent.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:04.125
We're beating around the bush

00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:06.667
because no one's
willing to say it.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.291
Say what, Michiru?

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:09.458
Go on.

00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:12.333
Listen, man,
you're not a lolicon? Fine.

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:13.500
But there's only one reason

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.208
we're still having
problems with this girl,

00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:17.041
you're still with her.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:18.834
If you're not gonna
talk to the girl,

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:21.417
quit messing around
and dump her.

00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:25.583
Michiru, you should
be nice to him.

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:27.959
Think about how Nagahiro
must be feeling.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:30.625
If he's saying it's
too early to talk to her,

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:33.208
it's probably because he
enjoys being engaged to her!

00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.166
And besides, they only have
a few more years together

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.834
before she ages out!

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.333
That's not how I feel.

00:14:38.417 --> 00:14:39.750
Never say that again...

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:42.792
Oh, all right.

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:45.667
I cannot in good conscience
allow this to continue.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.041
I, too, have been
at my wit's end.

00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:50.500
My engagement to Miss Kodaki

00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:53.458
was one that was decided
without our consent.

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:56.750
I've decided to annul
it as of today.

00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:04.875
Nagahiro, are you
comfortable with that?

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.792
Please don't do
anything on my behalf.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.208
As I've said many times,
I merely slipped!

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.333
It was no one's
fault but my own.

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:12.792
With all due respect, Leader,

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.291
even if that were the truth,

00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:16.709
the fact remains that Miss
Kodaki silently approached you

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.583
from behind and a moment
later you were injured.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:21.166
As such, it should
not have taken me

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.583
so long to arrive
at this conclusion.

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:27.834
I can't be expected to
shoulder my family's lineage

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:30.166
as a middle school student.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.667
I am her fiancé,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.834
but the way I've been behaving,

00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:35.083
you would think
I were her guardian.

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:37.417
And that is no longer okay.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.208
Our club's second rule
is to "be a boy," yes?

00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:44.000
[MANABU]
Hmm...

00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:52.041
Uh... Mayumi Dojima, are you
truly all right with all this?

00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:54.333
[MAYUMI] I'd begun to
feel sorry for Kodaki,

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:55.917
and I guess our leader
could see the guilt

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.250
written all over my face.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:00.041
I may not know
about family lineage,

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.083
but I know this
she's just a girl.

00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:06.208
She's an evil,
calculating, and foolish girl

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.250
with an irredeemable
personality.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.834
She's violent,
sharp-tongued, and scheming.

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:12.834
And those are
terrible qualities,

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:14.625
but she's just a girl.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:16.667
So, in the end...

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:23.458
[MAYUMI] ...it just doesn't feel
right for me to abandon her.

00:16:23.542 --> 00:16:27.625
After all I am Mayumi the Seer.

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:30.333
No, I'm not all right
with this, Leader.

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:33.583
A world where we only help
good people or people we love,

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.959
isn't a world I find beautiful.

00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:41.959
Even people we hate,
deserve our help, too!

00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:43.709
[MAYUMI grunts]

00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:48.166
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.542
Our problem right now

00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.709
is that we don't know
how Kodaki gets in and out.

00:16:51.792 --> 00:16:54.709
That means we have no idea
how or when she'll strike again

00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:57.166
or how dangerous
her next "gift" will be.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.041
If we can get rid
of that possibility,

00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:00.583
then we buy ourselves some time,

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:02.417
and we're back
to situation normal.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.125
And getting back to normal
means solving mysteries

00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:07.500
and not talking about
annulling an engagement!

00:17:07.583 --> 00:17:12.291
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:13.875
There has to be an answer--

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:16.083
one that's actually
based in reality.

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.291
How is it possible that
a human-sized <i>hagoita</i>

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:21.834
was transported, unobserved,
in the arms of a first-grader?

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:25.208
How was she able to get it
into the art room when I tried

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:27.500
and I couldn't get it
to budge without help?

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:29.875
How did she manage it alone?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.709
Those who seek the stars
look only to the sky.

00:17:34.792 --> 00:17:38.291
Yet in our complacency,
we tend to forget.

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:39.458
The ground that you see

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:42.792
when you hang your head
is part of a star.

00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:47.542
[MAYUMI]
Thanks to all our hard work

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.208
and Sakiguchi's special
training class 2-B

00:17:50.291 --> 00:17:53.125
received the gold award
in the choir contest!

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:54.417
I know, right?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.959
Nobody cares.

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.083
I guess I should mention we
didn't earn the gold award.

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:00.625
Yubiwa Academy makes a big thing

00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:03.166
out of upholding
fairness and equality

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.417
so despite its name
the "choir contest"

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.125
lacks a ranking system.

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:10.333
Everyone who participated
was awarded first place.

00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:11.875
I know, I know.

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:14.959
So, anyway, getting back to
the story that actually matters,

00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:16.834
I'll begin with the conclusion:

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.041
the engagement between
Nagahiro Sakiguchi

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:23.125
and Kodaki Kawaike survived
to see another day.

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:25.625
The student council president's
status as a lolicon,

00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:28.000
however, is still undecided.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:29.709
I don't know if it's a
good thing or a bad thing

00:18:29.792 --> 00:18:31.709
that we haven't
cleared that up yet,

00:18:31.792 --> 00:18:34.208
but the weather is nice today.

00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:36.750
The one seeking the stars
was a reference to me

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:40.208
and the ten years I spent
searching the night sky.

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:43.625
In this case, the "sky"
doesn't have to be the heavens

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:45.250
just the ceiling.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.208
And, sticking
with the same analogy,

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:50.083
if we then interpret "the
ground" to imply our floor,

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:51.417
the truth may have been hiding

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.709
beneath our feet the whole time.

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:56.834
If I were to carve out
a piece of the floor

00:18:56.917 --> 00:18:58.917
in order to fashion
a large paddle,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.375
the most discreet place
would be underneath the table.

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.542
I'd sneak into the art room

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:05.291
when I knew
no one would be there.

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:07.792
I'd cut open the carpet
carve out the floor,

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:10.125
And, of course, I wouldn't
be able to use it as is,

00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:12.417
so I'd sand the wood
to make it shine.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.500
Any sawdust I created

00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:15.917
could be swept under the carpet.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.959
Nicely done, Mayumi.

00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.709
Although, even if we presented
this evidence to her,

00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:25.417
in all likelihood, Miss Kodaki
would still refuse to confess.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.208
But if we understand
her methods,

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:30.458
we're prepared for whatever
she does in the future.

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:33.583
I must say, the "demon"
sure has found a great friend.

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:36.667
[MAYUMI] Hold on.
Who are you talking about?

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.917
And me?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.458
Seems I've found myself
a good underclassman.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.250
[MAYUMI] Yeah, yeah,
I guess I've found myself

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:48.917
a great upperclassman
as well, Mr. Senpai.

00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:53.291
[MAYUMI]
Hey, Leader?

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.583
Why wouldn't you let
Kodaki join the club

00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:58.375
if you were willing to
welcome me with open arms?

00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:00.583
May I first correct
a misunderstanding?

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:01.834
Mayumi dear...

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:04.500
I was never pushed down
any stairs by the demon.

00:20:04.583 --> 00:20:06.500
I have said it
over and over again,

00:20:06.583 --> 00:20:08.458
but nobody takes me seriously!

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:11.417
Am I lacking in conviction
as a leader, that is?

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.458
Huh? Wait.

00:20:12.542 --> 00:20:15.542
So you weren't
covering for Kodaki?

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.041
If her presence goes undetected

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:19.000
even if she's
standing behind you,

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:20.542
then if she were
to start talking,

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:23.834
that would probably
catch anyone by surprise.

00:20:23.917 --> 00:20:25.208
[MANABU]
As for the reason why

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:27.917
I decided to reject Miss
Kodaki's bid for membership,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.208
I think you'll find the answer
to be ever so obvious, Mayumi.

00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.291
At the end of the day,

00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:35.000
we are the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:39.375
You do agree this is no place
for a young girl in love.

00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:42.709
[MAYUMI]
It wasn't because she was a girl

00:20:42.792 --> 00:20:44.542
but because she was in love.

00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:47.458
Her heart was on fire over
the state of her family,

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:49.625
and she wore those
emotions on her sleeve,

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:50.917
and just as he did with me,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.583
Sotoin probably saw
right through her.

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:55.083
If that's the truth
behind his decision

00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:57.208
to keep her at arm's length,

00:20:57.291 --> 00:20:59.709
then credit that
to his aestheticism.

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:02.208
However, were those
passionate feelings

00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:05.917
really all just the result of
frustration with her fiancé?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.083
Tell Manabu I don't want
that stupid <i>hagoita</i> .

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.041
So just throw the thing away.

00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:11.500
Then die.

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:15.792
[MAYUMI] Kodaki said
"Tell Manabu I don't want it"

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.375
"It was meant for him..."

00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:19.625
The fact she specified him

00:21:19.709 --> 00:21:22.333
instead of her fiancé
is probably something

00:21:22.417 --> 00:21:25.542
that can be interpreted
in many different ways...

00:21:25.625 --> 00:21:28.458
If the real person Kodaki hoped
to receive the <i>hagoita</i> from

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:30.041
was actually our leader,

00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:32.250
that would be an
unpopular revelation--

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.750
one I wouldn't expect
would get any traction.

00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:38.291
If she didn't push him when
she came up behind him,

00:21:38.375 --> 00:21:40.083
then what was she doing there?

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.291
And what might
she have said to him

00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:44.792
if they'd had a chance
to speak, I wonder.

00:21:44.875 --> 00:21:47.667
Anyway, I probably
shouldn't speculate on it;

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.375
it's not very becoming
of a detective.

00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:52.875
It's one thing to joke around,
tease each other,

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:54.792
and give really
bad dating advice,

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:56.792
but in this case, it just
doesn't feel like behavior

00:21:56.875 --> 00:22:01.041
I should be encouraging,
let alone talking about.
