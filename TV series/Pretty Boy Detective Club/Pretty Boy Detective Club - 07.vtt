[NAGAHIRO]
You see, originally...

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.709
...this painting
depicted the entirety

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:20.667
of Yubiwa Academy's student body

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.959
as they sat for an assembly.

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.417
However...

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.166
Every last one of
those painted students

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.125
was taken from their painted
seats in a mass kidnapping

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.166
from a massive painting,
fulfilling a threat

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.875
made seven years ago
by the artist, Ms. Towai.

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:35.917
[MAYUMI]
In other words,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.583
Ms. Towai removed
the student body

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:38.959
by replacing the painting

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.625
with one she made of a
completely empty auditorium,

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.208
devoid of any students at all.

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.625
You'd think the school
would file criminal charges,

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:50.125
considering she committed
such a large-scale theft.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:51.792
As much as they may
have wanted to,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.417
Yubiwa Academy had a good reason

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.625
to not file criminal
charges against Ms. Towai.

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:58.041
The colossal kidnapping
in question

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.583
was an impossible crime,
you see.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.583
An impossible crime...

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.083
Really, now...

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.834
I mean, isn't that a
bit of an exaggeration?

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.458
After all, how
impossible would it be

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:14.000
to simply switch one
painting for another?

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.667
Simply?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.583
Simply...?

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.291
This painting?

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.500
I see, Sakiguchi.

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:22.834
The paintings are a lot bigger

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:25.250
than the auditorium entrance.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.250
So how in the world
did Ms. Towai manage

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.125
to switch out the paintings?

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.041
Consider, for instance,
the ship in a bottle.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.417
The only way to get
the ship in there

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.792
would be to put pieces of it
in the bottle one-by-one

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.667
and build it once it's inside.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.125
Ms. Towai must have
done the same thing

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:46.834
on a larger scale
when she painted

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:49.250
The Auditorium
in the Auditorium.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.250
She started her work
by bringing the materials

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.583
into the auditorium
piece-by-piece

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.667
and creating the canvas there.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.041
But what that
doesn't explain...

00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:00.834
...was how she switched
the other painting out...

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:03.333
Moving the original
would be a crime,

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:06.834
so she couldn't let
anyone see her remove it.

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:09.917
But that's impossible.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:13.792
An impossible crime.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.291
Marvelously played,
my dear Nagahiro.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.333
Who knew you had such a
beautiful trick up your sleeve!

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:23.625
I bet we could easily
remove all of this guesswork

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.250
if we just get the story
straight from Ms. Towai.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.959
Now, what kind of
detectives would we be

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.875
if we were to get
the details of the crime

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.417
from the criminal herself?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.417
The perpetrator's
confession does not count

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.125
as evidence in my opinion.

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.667
Of course, I'd be happy
to hear Lady Towai's tale

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.709
as long as it were to confirm

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.500
that our own
suspicions were correct.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:42.750
Nagahiro.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:44.166
Is it proper to assume
that you already have

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000
Lady Towai's whereabouts
under investigation?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.875
How soon can you find her?

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.375
I believe we'll have her
location by tomorrow morning.

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.000
[MANABU]
Excellent.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:57.583
Well, then! Let's all reconvene
here early tomorrow morning.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.250
Until then, I expect everyone

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.792
to do their best
in rooting out the truth.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.583
That's your homework!

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:36.917
[MAYUMI] The gentlemanly
Mr. Delinquent and Mr. Bare-Legs

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.375
tried to walk me
home after school

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:40.583
like they did the day before...

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:43.458
...but I gave those
pretty boys the slip.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:48.041
[LAI]
I'll be waiting for you there.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:49.875
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.583
The choice is yours.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.208
[LAI chuckles]

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.333
To be perfectly frank,

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:05.583
there's something
I'd be grateful

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.542
for you to return to me,
Miss Dojima.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:10.709
Now, do you remember
the money I dropped

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:13.291
that you were kind
enough to pick up?

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.542
It can tie me to activities I'd
rather have left in the dark.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.542
I'm sure you can see
why I'd want it back.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.458
[MAYUMI]
Sounded reasonable enough...

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.834
Even so, I was certain it
was merely an excuse

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.041
to see me in person.

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.375
At the same time,

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:30.709
this was an excuse for me
to see him in person.

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.041
The thing is,

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.291
I had a burning question
that only he could answer.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.750
My overwhelming
eyesight earned me

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:40.250
my Pretty Boy name,
Mayumi the Seer.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.583
And it's thanks to my vision

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:45.709
that I witnessed Fudatsuki's
cheating stagehand.

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:48.583
But how on earth did
Fudatsuki see the stagehand?

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:49.792
How did he know what gestures

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.875
his stagehand was making?

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.333
Which brings me
to the real question:

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:57.709
Does Lai Fudatsuki have
the same eyesight I have?

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.083
I had to know.

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.208
That's why
I couldn't let anything

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.959
get in the way of our meeting,

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:03.917
not even my escorts.

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.458
There's nothing
extraordinary about my eyesight.

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:15.166
It's quite ordinary.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.125
I'm sorry I failed to live up
to your expectations.

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:24.792
These contacts make
invisible clothes visible.

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:28.375
Ohhh... So that's how it's done.

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:32.917
[MAYUMI] Mr. Delinquent
was right on the money.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.792
It was pretty unlikely
I'd ever meet someone else

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.750
with eyesight like mine.

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:38.583
I am a rare breed.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.291
[LAI] I'm sorry I failed
to live up to your expectations.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.875
No, it's fine.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.041
It's not as if I had really high
expectations to begin with.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:56.542
By the way, I hope the advice
I provided proved useful.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.875
Huh?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.917
Well, it was useful,
but not put to good use.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.542
It helped me feel less awkward.

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.542
So, thank you.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.166
Hypothetically speaking...

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.667
Suppose you found,
oh, let's say,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.917
the reproductions
of 33 classic paintings

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.834
that happened to be
missing their main subjects

00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:14.875
in the attic of
your school's art room.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.250
Any idea why they
would even exist?

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:20.583
And so, ever so naturally
and nonchalantly...

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:22.041
Well, that's unfortunate.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:23.291
But it does go to show...

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:26.583
I'm not made out to be
a detective after all.

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:28.959
I'd've never guessed that
the strange tale you shared

00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:32.208
would turn into the story
of a mass kidnapping overnight.

00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:34.875
Now that's what I call
a real second act twist!

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.542
Well, then. If that's the
direction it's going to go,

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.417
then the solution
may end up being

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.625
"what is essential
is invisible to the eye."

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:46.208
[MAYUMI] With all I can
see that's inessential,

00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.166
and very little invisible to me,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.542
am I left with less of the
important things in life

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.959
than anyone else?

00:07:57.542 --> 00:07:59.041
This envelope is quite cute.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.333
Thank you for returning
the money you found.

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:03.333
I was wondering,
are you going around

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.458
and collecting all the cash
you handed out personally?

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:08.250
Is this part of your job?

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.291
Let's just say I'm helping
with some after-sales service.

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:12.500
And in your case,

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:14.000
I simply thought it
would be a good idea

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:17.667
to retrieve the bills
from you personally.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.125
And why is that?

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:21.125
[LAI]
Why do you think, Ms. Dojima?

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.583
[MAYUMI] The money wasn't
the real reason to see me.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:24.875
There's something
else you had in mind

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:26.500
when you arranged this meeting.

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:28.583
A true agenda.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.000
[LAI]
Incorrect.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
[MAYUMI]
Wait...

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:35.333
You really don't
have another agenda?

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:36.417
[LAI]
I really don't.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.250
[MAYUMI]
Really?

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.291
[LAI]
Really.

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:39.458
[MAYUMI]
Not one?

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:41.250
Not even one.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.792
I set up this little rendezvous
because I wanted to see you.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.291
There's simply no other reason.

00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:49.041
[MAYUMI]
If you really wanted to see me,

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.625
you could have just ambushed me
just like you did before.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:54.458
You didn't have to go through
all this trouble for us to meet.

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:56.000
Oh, it's no trouble.

00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.750
This is what I wanted.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.250
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:11.333
For investors like me,

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.792
making good
connections with those

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:14.750
who hold valuable
insight like yourself

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.250
is simply part
of what I must do.

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.583
So I hope you'll do me the honor

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:21.917
of meeting with me like
this every now and again.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.375
Well, maybe if I feel like it...

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:25.250
[LAI]
That's fine.

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.750
When you're ready.

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.834
Frankly speaking,
you never should have agreed

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:31.375
to see me like this in
the first place, you know.

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:32.625
[MAYUMI gasps]

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:34.834
[LAI] You mean it
didn't occur to you?

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:37.500
How the Pretty Boy Detective
Club may feel betrayed

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:38.750
when they find out you decided

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.709
to pay the rival school's
top brass a visit?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.667
But maybe you've grown tired

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.709
of having to play nice
with those friends of yours...

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:49.250
...and would much
rather speak with an enemy

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:53.041
whom you wouldn't
have to be so considerate of.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.750
You do realize that...

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:56.250
...we aren't the
only ones around here

00:09:56.333 --> 00:10:00.333
that are after you and
those wonderful eyes of yours.

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:02.542
[MAYUMI] He was certainly
right about that.

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:03.834
However...

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:05.417
Just to be perfectly clear,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.000
I never have to "play nice"
with any of my friends.

00:10:08.083 --> 00:10:09.917
In fact, they would hate that.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.542
I don't have to be
careful around friends.

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.834
The last thing they'd
want is for me to act

00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:17.417
like I'm walking on
eggshells around them.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.583
More than that,

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.917
friends don't have
to be careful around me.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.667
I go when I want to go.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.375
I run when I want to run.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:25.959
I say what I want to say

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:28.000
and see the people
I want to see...

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:29.500
That is to say...

00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:31.667
It's what I'd always dreamed of.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.542
I have no problem telling
them what I've seen.

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.291
What I'm trying to say is,

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:41.625
I can be myself around them
more than anyone else.

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:43.917
[LAI] Excuse me
for saying this, but

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.834
if you want friends that you
don't have to be careful around,

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:48.583
perhaps you'll
consider allowing us

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:51.667
to be your friends
as well, Ms. Dojima.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.041
Huh?

00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:56.041
If it's what you wish,

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:59.792
you may stop by our school
whenever you so desire.

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:02.417
Me and my companions in the
Heartbreaker Street Irregulars

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.417
are ready to welcome you
with open arms

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.875
and put your eyes to good use.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.333
[MAYUMI] Sorry to interrupt
you while your sleuthing...

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:28.208
...but would you
mind escorting me home?

00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.375
Wait, you mean you
noticed I was back here?

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:33.542
No, actually,
I had a sneaking suspicion.

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.875
And Mr. Bare-Legs?

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.542
[MICHIRU]
He headed over to your place.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:37.542
[MAYUMI]
Okay, then.

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:38.667
Can you give him a call

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.208
and let him know
that his beloved friend

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:41.750
is safe and sound?

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.208
[MICHIRU]
You're real funny.

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.041
Just for that, I'm gonna
cook you a dish to die for.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.667
A real killer meal.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.709
Uh...

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.667
A real harsh punishment.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.959
[MICHIRU]
So you and the enemy boss.

00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:55.667
What was that about?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.750
I had a hard time
hearing that last part...

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:00.291
[MAYUMI]
It's a secret.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.375
[MAYUMI] I had to sit on
my knees getting scolded

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:08.750
for three straight hours
when I got home.

00:12:08.834 --> 00:12:10.792
Which means
I had no time to work

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.417
on the homework that
our leader gave us.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.667
So the next day,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.959
I had to go to school
with no plan whatsoever.

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.333
Oh, well.

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:23.542
I'm sure they don't expect much
from their newest club member.

00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:26.083
It's my first real
assignment, after all.

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:27.500
Ahh, there you are!

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:29.667
Our Young Dojima
has finally arrived!

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.417
And now that you're here,
you can tell us your theory!

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.417
[MAYUMI]
They expect a lot of me.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.583
All right, then, it sounds like

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:39.250
we should have
Ms. Dojima go first today.

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.750
[MAYUMI]
Mmm...

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.291
[MAYUMI]
If you say so.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:45.583
My dear gentlemen.

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.291
Please listen closely.

00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:50.208
Through sound reasoning
and logical deduction,

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.875
I have uncovered the truth!

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:54.041
An abduction occurred
seven years ago.

00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:55.792
And this is how!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.417
Well? Something
wrong, Young Dojima?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.291
You just stopped right
as you were about to explain

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.792
what really happened.

00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:12.291
Actually, Dojima,
I just realized something.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.375
You never actually looked
at that giant painting

00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:16.583
with your infamous
eyes, did you?

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:30.625
Come now, Mayumi Dojima!

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:34.667
You can only keep us in
suspense for so long, you know!

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.417
Well, hurry and tell us already!

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.083
I...

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:52.834
What theory were you and
Fudatsuki able to come up with

00:13:52.917 --> 00:13:54.542
when you put
your heads together?

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.083
[gasps]

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.709
You mean you were aware of
it this whole time, Leader?

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:00.709
Of course!

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:01.792
I wouldn't be much
of a detective

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.625
if I didn't know
that Mayumi Dojima

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:07.166
had beautifully reconciled
with our former enemy!

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.375
[MAYUMI]
Beautifully reconciled, huh?

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:14.792
Precisely because it
was nothing like that

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.917
is why I had to make it
sound like it really was.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.375
I had to turn my actions
into something beautiful.

00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:23.458
Which means the thing
they needed from me

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:26.834
right now was neither
an apology nor my concern.

00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:28.333
A theory.

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:29.875
They needed
a theory as a member

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:31.667
of the Pretty Boy
Detective Club,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.959
one that would match
our leader's expectations.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:40.500
To be pretty, to be a boy,
to be a detective...

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:41.625
And...

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:43.792
...to be a team.

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.041
So, um...

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:48.709
Does anyone here know
how to put on contacts?

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:49.542
I have these.

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:51.125
See?

00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:03.417
Finally, I saw
straight through...

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.834
...to the truth.

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:08.083
Instead of heightening
my vision even further,

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:09.875
the contacts attenuated it,

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:11.625
taking my eyesight
that was too good

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:14.417
and replacing it with eyesight
that was just right.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.166
No way... The painting was never
swapped out in the first place.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.291
--[HYOTA] Hm?
--[MICHIRU] Hm?

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:22.041
[MAYUMI]
She painted over it completely.

00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:24.583
This is the original.

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:26.458
Painted over it...

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:28.333
Are you sure, Miss Dojima?

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:30.125
This is quite a large painting.

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:31.625
To repaint such
a massive canvas

00:15:31.709 --> 00:15:33.125
would be a difficult feat.

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:34.959
A time consuming one, at that.

00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:38.250
If a single person had
to do it on their own...

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.458
[MAYUMI]
But what if she wasn't alone?

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:42.709
[MAYUMI]
What if that was the motive

00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:45.125
behind the mass
kidnapping all along?

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.792
To pull off a
criminally huge heist

00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:49.417
while coordinating
with a bunch of people.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.000
[NAGAHIRO]
I don't understand.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:54.208
Who are you referring
to as "a bunch of people"?

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:56.917
[MAYUMI] Her students
here at Yubiwa Academy.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.625
The very same students that she,

00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:02.375
Ms. Kowako Towai, taught as
an art teacher on this campus.

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:03.709
That means the mass kidnapping

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.375
that occurred seven years ago
wasn't just theft.

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:09.250
It was, in fact,
Ms. Towai's final lesson.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:12.166
She treated the repainting
of the canvas like a project,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.834
teaching her students
everything she could

00:16:13.917 --> 00:16:15.500
through the experience.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.000
[MAYUMI] The reason Ms. Towai
disappeared seven years ago

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.250
and has been missing
ever since might be

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:28.417
because she wanted to take
the blame for the crime.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.083
She wanted to make
sure the students

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:33.417
who worked alongside
her wouldn't be punished.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.834
That was beautiful.

00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:39.500
Well... Well, I...
I could be wrong.

00:16:39.583 --> 00:16:42.250
I mean, there's no real proof
that anything I said is true.

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:44.417
[KOWAKO]
Every word of it is true.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.250
You must be Ms. Towai.

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.083
Indeed, I must.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:54.417
Kowako Towai at your service.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.959
Former teacher, current
artist extraordinaire...

00:16:57.041 --> 00:17:00.458
and as you're all well aware,
infamous kidnapper.

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:02.542
With how much Yubiwa's
staff hates me,

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:05.375
I didn't really want
to show my face around here.

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.166
But then I heard
some kids had the nerve

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.291
to break into
my erstwhile art room

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.125
and use it without my blessing.

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:12.417
And I bet it was you.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.333
Yup! You've caught
us red-handed.

00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:16.333
We're the Pretty Boy
Detective Club.

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:17.792
[KOWAKO]
Hmph. Funny name.

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:20.458
So that's one mystery
you can check off,

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:21.959
what about the other one?

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.625
Unlike that huge, repainted
canvas in the auditorium,

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:26.709
those paintings I did on my own.

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:28.208
For the solution
to that mystery,

00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:31.375
we'll have our resident
artiste answer.

00:17:32.792 --> 00:17:33.917
Instead of...

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.875
...painting the people
originally there...

00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:39.709
...you painted gods instead.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.750
[MAYUMI] Those 33 paintings
were completely devoid

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:43.625
of human figures.

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:47.834
Or, if you looked at it a
different way, you could say...

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:52.041
...that everything but humans
were in those paintings.

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:53.458
No humans.

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:54.625
The paintings Ms. Towai

00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:57.166
chose all had people
as part of a scene.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.166
And in essence,

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.291
she had asked those people

00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:01.875
to exit the locked room
of their canvas.

00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:04.542
But what about the paintings
she didn't choose?

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.417
None of them were
self-portraits.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.667
No matter how renowned

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.458
or how universally
regarded as masterpieces,

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:13.250
she refused
to paint a single one.

00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:14.625
Some say that the Mona Lisa

00:18:14.709 --> 00:18:18.709
may be a self-portrait
painted by Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:21.667
No matter how unreliable
the rumor may be,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.041
if there was the slightest
chance it were true,

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:26.041
she refused to risk
removing the image

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:30.208
of an artistic genius from
the canvas they called home.

00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:32.917
So if she chose to remake
one of those paintings,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
she'd be forced
to leave the person in it,

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:38.375
causing the theme of her works
to lose all meaning.

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:39.750
And what was her theme?

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.250
It was none other than...

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:42.667
Faith.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.208
That faith was expressed

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:46.917
not by painting artists
as godly creators,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.625
but instead by refusing to paint
anyone who wasn't an artist.

00:18:50.709 --> 00:18:51.875
She painted what she wanted

00:18:51.959 --> 00:18:54.041
through what she didn't paint.

00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:56.583
The likenesses of those
Ms. Towai worshipped as

00:18:56.667 --> 00:19:01.834
an artist herself only existed
on the canvas of her heart.

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:03.208
[KOWAKO]
Okay, okay, you can stop.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.250
Enough, already, come on.

00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:08.083
I honestly didn't think
you'd give me the right answer.

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:09.834
Who are you, anyway?

00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:11.583
[MANABU]
That's Sosaku Yubiwa.

00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:14.458
Or Sosaku the Artiste.

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.834
[MICHIRU] There's still
one thing I don't get.

00:19:16.917 --> 00:19:19.000
Why'd you decide to
hide those 33 paintings

00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:22.291
in the crawl space above
your art room seven years ago?

00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:23.542
[KOWAKO]
No good reason.

00:19:23.625 --> 00:19:25.667
At least, there's
no deep meaning behind it.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.792
I imagined there'd come a day

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.333
when that art room
was in use again,

00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:31.250
and some kids would
wind up going up there

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:34.375
and have the luck of finding
the paintings I tucked away.

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:35.542
And when they did,

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.917
they'd all be like
"What the hell is this?"

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.083
Were you the one that
found it, Sosaku Yubiwa?

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:43.875
Actually, that honor
goes to Mayumi Dojima...

00:19:43.959 --> 00:19:45.875
Mayumi the Seer.

00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:48.875
I see. And who, exactly,
does that make you?

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.375
Me? I'm Manabu Sotoin.

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:52.000
Or Manabu the Aesthete.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:55.333
I'm the president of the
Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:19:55.417 --> 00:19:57.792
I, for one, think it's
great that a teacher

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:01.667
as dedicated as you taught on
our campus seven years ago.

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:04.000
And it's been an honor.

00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:06.208
I'm glad I was able to meet you.

00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:07.625
So, Ms. Towai...

00:20:07.709 --> 00:20:09.458
...about that art room of yours.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.291
As a reward for
solving your mystery,

00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:13.333
would you pass it onto us?

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:15.834
The Pretty Boy Detective Club
begs the privilege

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.375
to carry your beautiful legacy.

00:20:20.917 --> 00:20:23.083
[MAYUMI] And so, the
Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.667
gleefully claimed the
Yubiwa Academy art room

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.834
as its official headquarters.

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:30.583
I don't get it.
What was your motivation

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:33.792
for painting the ceiling,
Mr. Child Genius?

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:36.125
Oh, really now?

00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:37.709
Are you truly
the same Miss Dojima

00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:41.375
who recently demonstrated such
masterful powers of deduction?

00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.166
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.333
Several days later,

00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:48.709
Mr. Child Genius's
ceiling was complete.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:52.166
The scene he had created
was of the 88 constellations,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.333
a stunning painting
of the heavens.

00:20:55.417 --> 00:20:56.917
[laughs]

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.208
I'm glad you've taken a
liking to it, Mayumi Dojima!

00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:03.125
Your enjoyment is a
fitting reward for Sosaku.

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:06.166
who painted it
for you and you alone!

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.125
[MAYUMI]
Just for me?

00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:10.250
Well, now that we've
got this gigantic painting

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:11.291
on the ceiling,

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:12.875
I bet even someone
as morose as you

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:15.166
might actually lift
your head every so often.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.333
You mean you really went
through all this trouble for me?

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:19.834
What are you talking about?

00:21:19.917 --> 00:21:21.208
We did it together.

00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:22.583
We even received clearance

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:25.917
from Ms. Towai to move
forward with the ceiling art.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.291
Ha ha ha!

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:29.041
Until the time comes that
you decide to once again

00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:32.083
turn your gaze upon the real
night sky, Mayumi Dojima,

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:34.417
you can admire all the
beautiful stars right here

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.959
in the art room to
your heart's content!

00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:38.959
Now, then.
If you're done with your tea,

00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:41.125
it's time to get
ready for the party!

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:42.625
Let's have a grand celebration

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:45.959
in honor of our
beautiful masterpiece!

00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:50.375
[MAYUMI] Some things are so
beautiful they can't be painted.

00:21:50.458 --> 00:21:52.959
And that moment where
we all lifted our heads

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:55.458
to see the star-filled
ceiling; the moment

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:59.750
when I felt like I was one
of them for the first time...

00:21:59.834 --> 00:22:03.166
...will forever be a moment
I wish could be painted.
