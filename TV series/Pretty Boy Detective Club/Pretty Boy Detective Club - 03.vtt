00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
[REI]
He's unconscious.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:09.295 position:50% align:center
Even so, he absolutely
refuses to let go of your arm.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.590 position:50% align:center
Quite the masculine one,
wouldn't you say?

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
I mean, he is a boy, right?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
Here you go,
they're yours, right?

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI gasps]
My glasses!

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
The ones I forgot
this morning...

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.649 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
My name's Rei.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50% align:center
We won't be spending
much time together.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
C'est la vie.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
Please, let me speak
with whoever's in charge

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
of your group.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we can
work something out.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
That would be me.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.663 position:50% align:center
I'm in charge of the Twenties.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
Not only that, but I'm the
most competent of the bunch.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.170 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
I won't fight back.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
And I couldn't care less
what you have done to me.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.135 position:50% align:center
But I beg you...

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
Let him go home.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
He has nothing to do with this.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
Let him go.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
Oh, really...

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
How naÃ¯ve.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
I'm a kidnapper, a criminal,
and an evil wretched person.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.575 position:50% align:center
I think you will.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Is that so?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
She's clearly not a good person.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
However...

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
I don't think she's as bad
as she says she is, either...

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.341 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Have it your way.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Hey, Twelve.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
Stop the car.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] There's absolutely
no need to stop.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.770 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Because to live in
such a way isn't beautiful.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] After coming so far,
I was sure of it.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
Manabu Sotoin...

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
...is truly a bona fide idiot.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
kidnapped us, aren't you?

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.284 position:50% align:center
The name's Manabu Sotoin.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy
Detective Club's president.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
[REI]
I see...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
So, you're the president.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Now tell us who you are

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
and exactly what
it is you're after.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.254 position:50% align:center
Who we are is a mystery,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
and what we want is money.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
Don't bother asking
about our client.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
I really don't
know much about them.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
That's how we, the Twenties,

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
manage to maintain our
clients' privacy and security.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.227 position:50% align:center
How strange, to use ignorance
of your clients to defend them.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
See, if it were me,

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
I'd use that knowledge
to protect them.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
Protect them?

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
You can't protect anything
if you're six feet under.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
I can protect my aesthetic.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
If I can't protect that,

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
I might as well be unable
to protect anything at all.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
And by knowing aestheticism,
I understand everything.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
If you understand
as much as you say,

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
then you must know
why she's a target.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
It's because she saw something

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
no one was ever supposed to see.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
One question remains, however.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
Simply abducting one girl alone

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
won't guarantee
the secret won't get out.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
Does this mean you're
planning to round up

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
every last person who
witnessed the flash of light

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
on that day ten years ago?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
I see. So, you don't
know everything after all.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
That girl was the only witness.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
In fact, no one else in the
world was capable of seeing it.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dojima's eyes alone

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
could perceive what happened.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I have a problem with my eyes.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
It's not that my eyesight's bad,
it's that it's too good.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
I see things very,
very, very, very clearly.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
I can even notice people
hiding around corners,

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
or a group of students
from another school

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
walking toward me from afar.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
But that's not
all my eyes can see.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
My eyes are good
enough to make me

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
an unassuming witness

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
to a military
satellite being shot down.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
As far as my client's concerned,

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Mayumi doesn't represent
much of a threat to them.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
Because they can keep
their margin of safety

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
by continuing
surveillance on her.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Hah!

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
you've been secretly
surveilling an innocent girl

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
as she chased her dreams

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
while making astronomical
observations.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
For the last ten years,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
you've watched her
searched for a phantom star.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
To be clear, I wasn't
in charge of any of that.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
But it is true that Mayumi
was under surveillance.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
To be perfectly frank,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
there was some
talk of releasing her

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
from our surveillance soon.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
But who'd have ever thought
she would get so close

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
to discovering the
truth in a single day?

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the Pretty Boy
Detective Club for you.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
Just what is this Pretty Boy
Detective Club

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
you keep mentioning?

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
One, you must be pretty.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
Two, you must be a boy.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
Then there's Three,
be a detective, of course.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
That's what your
little club's about?

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
My, my. Talk about literal.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
Oh no.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
That alone is merely
a Pretty Boy Detective.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
Even if a group of pretty
boy detectives gather,

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
it would still only
be a gathering

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
of pretty boy detectives.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
Which leads us to the most

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
important rule
of our "little club."

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
The Fourth Rule.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
The Fourth Rule?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Be pretty, be a boy,
be a detective, and...

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
The Fourth Rule of the
Pretty Boy Detective Club:

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50% align:center
You must be a team.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE]
Boss!

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
Someone riding a bicycle's been
following us for a while now!

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
Would that happen to be
the boy you were riding with

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
in such an interesting
way this morning?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
Precisely.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
That's Hyota the Adonis.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Mayumi...

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
How do you see this situation?

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh? Wh-What do you mean...?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
Well, he doesn't appear to be
recklessly chasing after us.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
In fact, it would appear that

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
he has a clear agenda
in mind for his pursuit.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
Or so it seems.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Hey, Twelve, stop the car.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA pants heavily]

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Glad to see you're okay.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.121 position:50% align:center
Did they hurt you?

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
I haven't been harmed.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
If you're done catching
your breath, Short-Shorts,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
I need some answers.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
I'm Hyota the Adonis.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
You could say I'm a "leg it."

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
A "leg what"?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
So your legs are stunning,
what's your point?

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50% align:center
Wait, sorry.

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
Delegate.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
That's what I meant.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
As in an "envoy," ya know

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Envoy?

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Hey, Twelve.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
Whose current
whereabouts are unknown?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
[TWELVE] Well, it looks
like we haven't had

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
regular check-ins from Thirteen,
Eighteen, or Nineteen.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] I guess that means our
mission was a success, Dojima.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
So.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
What do you say, miss?

Hello?

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
I am Nagahiro Sakiguchi,

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
vice president of the
Pretty Boy Detective Club.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
I would like to
propose an exchange.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
You have our leader,
mobile unit...

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
...and client.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
We would like to make
an even trade for them

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
by returning your three cohorts

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
who are currently
in our custody.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Time and location?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
Time? Immediately.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
Location?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.359 position:50% align:center
I suggest the
middle school we attend.

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're familiar.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
Of course, this deal is
between you the Twenties,

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
and us--the Pretty Boy Detective
Club, with no outside parties.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
However...

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
If I find out you've put
a single scratch on my men,

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
I'll kill all
three of your friends.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
Listen, lady, that's our line.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
If Dojima, our leader,

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
or Hyota have even
one hair out of place,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
I will do everything
within my means to find you,

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
and I will kill you!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Don't concern
yourself with that,

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
just start preparing us
a meal for when we get back.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.484 position:50% align:center
I'm starving.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
And you know,
I could go for some Chinese.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] That's what's
on his mind right now?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Well, Leader.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
You're sounding
like your old self.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Why wouldn't I?

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
Have I ever been
something other than myself?

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
[REI] From what I can tell,
you have good team,

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
Sotoin.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
Actually, I have the best team.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
what do you think those
boys of yours are planning?

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
What's their game?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
How would I know?

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're asking
the wrong person.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
All I can say is that there's
one thing I know for certain...

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[MANAB[]
Before the night is over,

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.692 position:50% align:center
I'll be dining on Chinese food.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about my eyes.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
About your eyes?

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean
that secret of yours?

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
There's no need to apologize.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
Well then...

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
I suppose that explains
why you got mad

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
when I complimented
your very beautiful eyes.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
However, wouldn't
your perfect eyesight

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
be considered an
advantageous trait

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
for a would-be astronaut
like yourself?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Having such good vision
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
My eyes often get
fatigued from overuse.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Oh?

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
It's true that
I have remarkable eyes.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.813 position:50% align:center
I can see people
hidden behind walls...

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
...and the explosion of light

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
from military satellites
as they're shot down.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
But having such flawless
vision comes with a price.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hm?

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
I keep overusing them.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
And because of that...

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.495 position:50% align:center
...I'm apparently going
to go blind in my twenties.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
That's why I usually
wear these glasses.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
They're supposed
to help protect them.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.002 position:50% align:center
And why...

00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
I was forced to give up
on my childish dream.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
There's no way
someone like me

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
could ever hope
of becoming an astronaut.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
That also explains
why your parents

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
are so adamantly
against such a dream.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
They're completely
right in that regard.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
The true meaning of boyhood

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
is to have beautiful,
wondrous dreams.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.526 position:50% align:center
However, that doesn't mean a boy

00:12:14.609 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
would never give up
on <i>any</i> of those dreams.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
It's about having as
many dreams as you want.

[MAYUMI gasps]

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Rest assured, Mayumi Dojima.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that finding a dream

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
will prove to be much
easier than finding a star.

I'm going to have to insist
that you lend me a hand.

[MAYUMI grunts]
M-My shoulder...

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
Or should I say I insist
you lend me your eyes?

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
Those eyes that supposedly
can see beyond walls.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
Just let me know
if you see any traps.

Oh...

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
And don't worry
about telling me out loud.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to figure it out
just by looking at your face.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No way...

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
She must have been listening in

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
when I was telling Sotoin
the truth about my eyes.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
The client will always lie.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
Every good detective knows that.

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
I see. Mm-hmm.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
As long as you don't resist,
I won't be rough.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Neither you nor the
Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.459 position:50% align:center
will come to harm.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.379 position:50% align:center
I'm actually looking
forward to meeting them.

00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.047 position:50% align:center
Pretty boys, huh?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
They might be worth
a pretty penny.

[MAYUMI]
Three silhouettes of children,

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center

Sure you just leave it to me.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
A helicopter?

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Mm. I enjoy basking in
the spotlight as much as anyone,

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
but even for me,
this might be a bit much.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
[REI] It never was
my man, now, was it?

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
It was you from

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's correct, boss.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.628 position:50% align:center

No, that's not it.

Yes, that is correct, boss.

Oh, my dear Mayumi.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
How did you fail
to see this trap?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
Knowing your eyes,

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
how could you not have
noticed the helicopter?

[MANABU]
Oh, come now!

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
You can't seriously
be asking that!

Don't you see?

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
The outcome of your plot,

as well as the
ending of this story...

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
share a foregone conclusion

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
that was inevitable
from the very start!

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
You're the ones who
stole Dojima's motivation

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
to look to the sky.

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
There's no one to blame
but yourselves for this!

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.095 position:50% align:center
You all did a fantastic job.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:12.430 position:50% align:center
Thanks to you, this case
will go down in history as

has yet to start...

With all that's happened,

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
we're sure to receive
a tongue-lashing

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
once we arrive
at the police station.

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center

[HYOTA]
Before that...

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
Is there anything to eat?

I'm starving.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center

not to spit out my cooking,

you're welcome
to join us for dinner.

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Count me in.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
Rei?!

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't look so surprised.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
Breaking out of prisons
is a hobby of mine.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
Special delivery.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
And this time,
you're on the receiving end.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
Don't worry,
it's just a message.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.123 position:50% align:center
Funny enough,
it's from the people

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
who hired me to
kidnap you yesterday.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Since that didn't go as planned,

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
they'd instead like
to make a deal.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
If you promise to stay quiet

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:32.677 position:50% align:center
about the event you
witnessed ten years ago...

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
they will do what
they can to help you

00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
with that lifelong
dream of yours.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
Congratulations.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
Looks like all those
years of staring up

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.982 position:50% align:center
at the night sky wasn't
a waste of time after all.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
I can't accept.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
You're saying no?

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
If you're sure, I'll tell
them you declined their offer.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:58.078 position:50% align:center
But realize this is
your future on the line.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] So what if
my future's on the line?

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
Seriously.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
When his life was on the line,

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
he had the perfect response.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
One I think I'll borrow.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
"To live in such a
way isn't beautiful."

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
They don't have to worry.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
I'm not planning
to tell anyone about it.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
The Pretty Boy
Detective Club is a group

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
that requires confidentiality
from the client.

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
I'll go ahead
and let them know that.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
Hey, everybody!

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
You're still wearing that crap?

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
Didn't realize
you were a hypocrite.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
You're acting like someone

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
who bashes their
boss until they quit.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
Then when they do,
you bash 'em some more

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
by saying how irresponsible
they are for quitting.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's just me,
but personally,

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
I like it better
when girls wear skirts.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
Then again, since everyone's
already wearing black stockings,

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
I guess it doesn't
really matter.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
Well, why not?

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
I think it's simply
wonderful, myself.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
Overall, I think
she looks rather lovely.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
Who would ever guess
that she's wearing a wig?

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
So Dojima, is there a reason

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
you're still
wearing that disguise?

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Actually, is Sotoin around?

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
Oh?

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
It's just as
I told you last time,

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.582 position:50% align:center
he's only a "Kogoro" so he can't
come here right after class.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakiguchi, I hope this
doesn't sound too silly,

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
but I've been wondering what
grade and class Sotoin's in.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
I just can't seem to
figure it out for myself.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
He's a fifth grader in class A.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see, that explains it...

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.014 position:50% align:center
Wait, you mean Japanese
for "Little Five Boy"

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
and not Detective Kogoro?!

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
That's right. He's in Yubiwa
Academy's elementary division.

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.023 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to keep you waiting!

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, ho!

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.275 position:50% align:center
Do my eyes deceive me,

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
or does none other
than Mayumi Dojima grace us

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
with her presence?

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
I'll never get tired
of your beautiful eyes!

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.410 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I already knew what
my first words would be

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
once I saw Sotoin.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sotoin.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
If I remember correctly,

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
you said you're always looking
for more club members, right?

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Then how about letting me join

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
the Pretty Boy Detective Club
as a new member?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
[BOYS]
Huh?

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
Okay, so why
the sudden interest?

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
Well, the thing is...

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
It's just that...

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe
you might be able

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
to teach me how
to properly use my eyes.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
And that maybe you
could help find a way

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
to use my eyes in a just way.

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
No.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Not a just way.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
A beautiful way.

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Hmm...

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
It appears you've become
yet another person

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
captivated by the
temptations of beauty.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
That's just fine!

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.248 position:50% align:center
Aestheticism is not
only something to learn,

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
but something to teach.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
Hold up. You're
seriously considering this?

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
You know she's a girl?

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
As long as she
has a boy's heart,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
I don't see what the problem is.

00:20:58.883 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Michiru.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.219 position:50% align:center
Put together a banquet

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
for our new member's
welcoming party on the double!

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
[MANABU] Nagahiro, I trust you
with the welcome speech.

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:11.146 position:50% align:center
Hyota, I'm really
looking forward

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
to watching your
first-class tapdancing.

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
Oh! And Sosaku?

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
Let's take this
as an opportunity

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
to create a club member badge.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:23.199 position:50% align:center
Welcome aboard, Mayumi Dojima.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
You made it through
your tumultuous birthday,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.079 position:50% align:center
and still you failed
to become an adult.

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
Until you envision
your next dream,

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
until you decide to gaze
at the sky once more,

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
you can rest your
tired wings here with us.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
A new star that
shines brightly upon you

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
will surely be found someday.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
May you search to
your heart's content.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
For such a beautiful search
is indeed our duty.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the
Pretty Boy Detective Club!

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
We are pretty.

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
We are boys.

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.524 position:50% align:center
And we are detectives.

00:21:56.608 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
Together, we are
the best team possible.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:04.741 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
On the day after I turned 14,

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
I gave up on my dream.

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.079 position:50% align:center
And I did it
with a bit of pride,

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
and with a bit of beauty.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.085 position:50% align:center
But this wasn't the end.

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:17.295 position:50% align:center
It was just the beginning.
