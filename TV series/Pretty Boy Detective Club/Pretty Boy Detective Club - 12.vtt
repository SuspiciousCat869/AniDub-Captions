00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Are you saying
her classmate Yokuya

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
almost killed her?

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
So that makes him the
hit-and-run driver.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU]
Maybe, maybe not.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
We don't know that the guy
who tried to run over Mayumi

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
is the same guy
that hit Naganawa.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA] Let's be real,
how many dudes are out there

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
trying to run over
middle-school kids?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
There's no way this isn't
the guy we're looking for.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] Perhaps it was
just meant as a threat...

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.291 position:50% align:center
Rather than try to kill her,

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
perhaps the assailant
sought only a means

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
to intimidate Miss Mayumi.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
But he wasn't... looking at me.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
How so?

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] His eyes were elsewhere
at that crucial moment.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
Yokuya didn't even look
like he was paying attention.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
So is it your sense this
was an accident on his part?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.771 position:50% align:center
That Yokuya let himself
become distracted

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
while driving
and almost hit you?

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.275 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
As his car accelerated,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
threatening to run me
over--to run over

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
a human being--he only
had one hand on the wheel.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.241 position:50% align:center
His other hand was preoccupied,

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
messing around on
his smart phone.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
It didn't feel like
he was distracted...

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
It felt more like
he just didn't care.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
Like he was simply running
me over in his spare time

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
in order to give
himself something to do.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
I was terrified...

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.551 position:50% align:center
Terrified of cars to the point

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.513 position:50% align:center
where I never wanted
to walk down a road again,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.725 position:50% align:center
but more than that,
I was terrified of him.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
I didn't want anything
to do with him anymore.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.690 position:50% align:center
Forget about switching seats,
I wanted to swap classes.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.942 position:50% align:center
Hell, I wanted to transfer
schools if I could.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
That's how scared I was.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.032 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] How was I supposed to
go up against someone like that?

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
Someone with the capacity
to be so cold-blooded.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Maybe...

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.582 position:50% align:center
...we should call it quits.

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:11.589 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you might really
be murdered next time.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.676 position:50% align:center
Your hard work and resolve have
been nothing short of beautiful,

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.930 position:50% align:center
but this is nothing worth
risking your life over.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
After all...

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
...isn't this simply
child's play...?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
I agree...

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
Even if it was
only intimidation,

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.447 position:50% align:center
it's still a threat.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
If you withdraw your
candidacy straight away,

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
I'm sure no further harm
will come to you.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] Honestly, if we're
gonna go up against the academy

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.498 position:50% align:center
over the state of
their curriculum,

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.501 position:50% align:center
we've got other ways
we can go about it.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
For sure...

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
As they say, "while
there's life, there's hope."

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
We've had some crazy
adventures together,

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.968 position:50% align:center
including a literal kidnapping.

00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
But murder might be
crossing a line, you know?

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.330 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
I can't quit!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
You're right that this
is only child's play.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
That's exactly why we
can't hang it up now!

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Uh?! But still, Mayumi--

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] If I stop here, I'm
not beautiful, I'm not a boy,

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
and I'm not a detective!!

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
But more than anything else,
I'm not part of the team.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand it.

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50% align:center
I just couldn't accept
hearing the words

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.356 position:50% align:center
"we should call it quits"
from the mouth

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50% align:center
of Manabu Sotoin,
from our Leader.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
And it was my fault.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
Because of me Mr. Delinquent,
Mr. Senpai,

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
Mr. Bare-Legs, and
Mr. Genius were all willing

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
to put up with this
sudden surrender.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't hear any more of it.

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:10.750 position:50% align:center
Granted.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
Someday we'll all graduate,

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.922 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure we'll outgrow
"child's play"...

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
But that day...

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
...is not today.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What message does it send

00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
if we let some lunatic
in a car silence us?

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
Manabu the Aesthete should not
be learning from defeat!

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
If you're going to learn,

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
it should be from
beauty, shouldn't it?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.650 position:50% align:center
Forget textbooks!

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Forget common sense!

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
We learn from aestheticism!

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
Don't we, Leader?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I have absolutely no
intention of risking my life

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
over the future of
this academy's curriculum.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
But I... am not in this art room

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
so that disgusting pretty boys

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
can pamper and protect me
from everything!

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
I am not a damsel.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
I am pretty boy, too!

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
I owe you an apology.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
What an embarrassing
slip of the tongue on my part.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
You've become quite the member
of Pretty Boy Detective Club

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
without me realizing it,
haven't you?

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Henceforth you are no longer
an apprentice Pretty Boy!

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Wait I was still an apprentice?

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
All right!

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
Mayumi!

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
And the rest of my boys!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
I retract my previous statement

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
and would like
to offer a revision!

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
Let's kick it up a notch!

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
From now until election day,

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
Mayumi can sleep over
here in the art room

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
as a security measure.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
What are we missing? Oh!

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
A bathtub made of cypress!

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
Sosaku, do you think
you can handle that?

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
If it's for Mayu.

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Whoa, he sounds normal!

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold up.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
Are you letting
Sosaku call you "Mayu"...?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Uhh, sleepover, huh?

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
As in, I'd be staying here?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
I-- Well, I guess
I'd have a bed...

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
...and a personal chef!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
If you want this personal chef
cooking for you,

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
you and I are gonna
have a little chat

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
about that nickname, right?

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
"Maaaayu"?

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Uhh... Oh! Hey!

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
Mr. Genius, are you really going
to be able to make a bathtub?

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Mm-hmm.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute...

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
Things are finally
feeling normal.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
It's starting to feel like the
Pretty Boy Detective Club!

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
[HYOTA]
As someone on an athletic team,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
if you guys built a bath,
life would be a lot easier!

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
Although, even a footbath
would be a game changer!

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
Classic Bare Legs!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
I can procure some space
over in the prep room.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
She'll feel at ease.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.737 position:50% align:center
Mayu's body could do with
a bit more polishing anyway,

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
so this works out well.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
Uhhhhh, quick question:
Is that your way of saying

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.370 position:50% align:center
you're going to
be bathing me...?

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
It's settled!

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
For the time being, this should
secure Miss Mayumi's safety!

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
And as for us,
we'll support her on all fronts!

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
She's our next president, boys!

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I know, super late on this,

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
but here's a rundown
on the election system

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
at Yubiwa Academy Middle School.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
The recommenders
and nominees each have

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
an opportunity to get up
and deliver their speech.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
Then, we all write down
the name of the person

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
we're voting for and
drop it into the ballot box.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
Incidentally, all of the
speeches are presented

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50% align:center
in order of year, class,
and attendance number.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
Meaning we start with
the candidates in class 2-A,

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center
and I end up going second
to last since I'm in class 2-B.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
The final speaker
will be Yokuya,

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.594 position:50% align:center
who is also in class 2-B.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
Luckily, my recommendation
speech will be taken care

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
of by the outgoing student
council president himself,

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
Nagahiro Sakiguchi.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
Once the master orator
works his magic,

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
my approval ratings,

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
which were in first
coming into this election,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
should be set in stone.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
Which is a relief,

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
considering the speech
I give right afterwards

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
will be hot garbage.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
The only wild card is that
Yokuya's speech is after mine,

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
and we still know
next-to-nothing about the guy.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE] Thank you in
advance for your consideration.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
You know...

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
I haven't really given it
too much thought.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
Why did Yokuya end up
becoming the top candidate

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
when Naganawa
was forced to retire?

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
You'd think it would
have been a candidate

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
from class A,
not someone like him...

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
So what is it about Yokuya
that made him resonate

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
with the student body in a
way that the others couldn't?

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
And more importantly, if
Naganawa was targeted

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
so she would withdraw
from the election,

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
and if I was targeted for
stepping up to replace her,

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.818 position:50% align:center
then why weren't any
of the other candidates

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
targeted in the same way?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
Why didn't Yokuya
go after any of them,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
the way he went after us?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA, MAYUMI] What made us
specifically a threat to him,

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
in a way that they weren't?

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
Ehhhh?

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
I'm right.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
That's what you're
thinking about, isn't it?

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.377 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA] I didn't go after
those other guys

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
because it would've
been a pain in the ass

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
and a waste of time.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
I don't make a hobby out
of running people over.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:37.095 position:50% align:center
But there was meaning
to Naganawa,

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
you see, and there
was meaning to you.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Because you had the student
council president's support.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
Without it the others don't
have a chance of winning,

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
with or without my involvement.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
you really turned Hill D
upside down, didn't you?

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
But you should know
just how laughably

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
off the mark you
were by fixating on it...

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
You see the place
I ran over Naganawa

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
wasn't Hill D, it was Hill C.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
I caught her on her way home

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
and hit her without
a second thought,

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
then I stuffed her in the trunk,

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
and left her on
the crosswalk at Hill D.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Dojima...

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm confessing
this to you right now,

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
right before your speech,
is because I want you uneasy.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
I want you scared, so when
you get up on that stage,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
you let everyone down
and then my chances go up.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
Y'get it?

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
Just what... what are you...?

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who, me?

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
I'm just an ordinary,
good-for-nothing,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
middle school student
like anyone else.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
I live an unremarkable life,

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
I'm unremarkable in school

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
and have unremarkable
athletic ability.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
I'm liked and disliked in
a pretty unremarkable way.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
And, oh yeah, I unremarkably
kill off my classmates.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Was this monster
really in my class?

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
No...

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
No, he wasn't!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
There was never any student
named Kinshiro Yokuya

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
in class 2-B with me!

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.150 position:50% align:center
Of course something felt off!

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
I'd called this!

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
He's just an aggregate of
a middle school student...

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
He's not unremarkable.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center
He's averaged.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center
A personality comprised

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
of every standard
middle school cliché.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
He must have snuck
in under the radar

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
and just pretended
he had always been there.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
Then, before anyone caught on,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
he was taking classes in 2-B

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
and running for student
council president...

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Ohhh?

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
Putting on a brave face, huh?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
Looks like you've got more guts

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
than I thought you did...

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda surprised.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
I should have should
have run you over,

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
left you to bleed out on Hill D.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Honestly, I was
glad to be the only one

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
who met the real Yokuya.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
Those good-natured
boys were better off

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
never knowing how vile he was.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA] Regardless, you're
not gonna win this election,

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
you know that, right?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
Those poll results
are nothing more

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.043 position:50% align:center
than a litmus test
for honest no lifes

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
who care enough to slog through
stupidly irrelevant questions.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
That's never gonna
tell you anything useful.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
The shadow I cast doesn't shine.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.346 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
What do you mean?

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA] I'm saying a majority
of the students are like me.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
I swore you
woulda been on my side

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
under normal circumstances...

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
Heady crap like
"politics" and "ideals,"

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
you know, polls,
and signature collection?

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Yes, most students,

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
they'll tell you it's
all boring and useless.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
But they're not
so against the system

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
that they'd ever revolt.

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
They're disaffected,
but they do as their told.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA] People like that
make up my supporters;

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
my allies in indifference.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
These kids want to vote
for someone like them.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
They want an easy going guy.

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Those stuffed shirts
talking on stage right now

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
don't realize that.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
The more you
look down on the audience

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
and talk about your "dreams,"
the more we think,

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
"We can't keep up
with all this. Forget it."

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
Gotta say, you gave me
a run for my money,

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
but this is the end of the line.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
As soon as the current
Student Council President

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
gives that speech,

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
it's gonna be lights-out
for your campaign.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
It'd be one thing if
they were supporting you

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
behind the scenes, you know?

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.991 position:50% align:center
But when people with power
take the stage, it's all over.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:29.327 position:50% align:center
Everyone's gonna realize
you're "one of them."

00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
Just another elite,
looking down her nose at us.

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.624 position:50% align:center
If you're smart,
you'd have done like me,

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
which is ask somebody in your
life that you're close with;

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
instead of having someone

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
from the ruling class
give your speech.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
I don't have anybody in
my life I'm close with...

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.345 position:50% align:center
[YOKUYA]
Oh?

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
What I have is...

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
[HOST A]
Coming up next,

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
we have the campaign
speech for Mayumi Dojima.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
Nagahiro Sakiguchi,
please take the stage.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Ladies! And! Gentlemen!

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Lend me your ears!

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
Just kidding!

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.810 position:50% align:center
I confess, although
I'm sure you can already tell,

00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
that I am not
Nagahiro Sakiguchi!

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
As a favor, I asked
to take his place.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
Because I wanted to support
Mayumi however I could,

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
and there's no better way
I can think of to do it.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll share
in my enthusiasm.

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
Now, the moment you've
all been waiting for,

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
my campaign speech!

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
To begin, I should be
upfront and state

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
that I am not here
to endorse Mayumi

00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
as student council president...

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
If that sounds suspect,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.548 position:50% align:center
then let me clarify
that I wish to celebrate

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
everything Mayumi does!

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.177 position:50% align:center
And so should you.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
And if possible,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
it's my hope that you'll
all support her as well.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:19.979 position:50% align:center
The first time I encountered
Mayumi was on a campus rooftop.

00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
She was but a girl,
in search of a star.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.652 position:50% align:center
She had seen it only
once ten years ago,

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
but she never
gave up on searching.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.282 position:50% align:center
Even when those
she trusted doubted her,

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
when they grew impatient
and turned their backs,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.996 position:50% align:center
she never lost hope,
and however stubborn,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
she continued her
hunt night after night.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
From the moment we met,
I knew Mayumi was beautiful.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
I could feel it from
the bottom of my heart.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Those beautiful eyes of hers

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
that steadfastly
searched the night.

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
In the end,
the star she was after

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.474 position:50% align:center
did not exist anywhere
in the night sky.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
However, that
didn't cause her eyes

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
to lose their brilliance
for even a moment.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
To dream is beautiful.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
But it can be equally beautiful
to give up on your dream.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
Mayumi Dojima continued
to sparkle like the stars.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
One time, she got
a hold of a LOT of money!

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
A wad of bills found its way

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
into her pocket
unexpectedly one day.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
As it so happened,

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
she didn't even think
to take advantage

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
of the fortune that
had fallen into her lap.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Was it a sense of
right versus wrong?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
Or a strong moral compass.

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it would suffice
merely to call it self-control.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
And why not?!

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
But I would like
to think that her actions

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
were rooted in self-respect.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
Not merely a desire to be just.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
But a desire to be beautiful!

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.904 position:50% align:center
She's not without her flaws.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
One time, for instance,

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
in her stubbornness she deeply
angered one of her friends.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
I wish I could say that
at the end of this story,

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
she was able to face
her shortcomings,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
admit that she was
wrong and apologize.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
But from what I've heard,
she still hasn't apologized!

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Still, what she lacked in words,
she made up for in actions.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
I admit, that's
not really a quality

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
we should be applauding all
the time, but no need to worry.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:19.307 position:50% align:center
Whenever Mayumi falters,

00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
we'll be there to catch her!

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
The way she always does for us,

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
whenever we have an
opportunity to improve!

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] I should stress,
Mayumi is not the kind of person

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
to practice nepotism and only
reward those closest to her.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Case in point,
she once saved a girl,

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
who she hated,
and who hated her back.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
She knew at the time it
wouldn't be appreciated

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
and that she may
even be ostracized.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
That was something
not even I could do.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
We love Mayumi.

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
She's very special to us.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
So if she's giving her best,

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
we'll support her with
everything we've got!

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
With Mayumi as student
council president,

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
things are bound to be fun.
Mark my words!

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
She may not be perfect,

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure that
she'll make mistakes.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
She's certainly prone
to getting stuck up at times.

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
But, whenever that happens,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
I can assure you it won't
go without a harsh scolding.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
After all, when
I became disheartened,

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Mayumi was there to
serve as my wake-up-call.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
That's what it means
to be a team.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
And Mayumi inspires us
to be our best.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
However, if we have one
complaint about Mayumi Dojima,

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
it's that her self-esteem
is ridiculously low!

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
Even now, she thinks of herself

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
only as a substitute candidate,

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
one who begrudgingly entered
the election as a last resort...

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
If elected,
she would probably assume

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
that it was only due
to the support

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
of the current student
council president.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
I don't like that.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
That's why I'd
like you to help me.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
Show her that you do
have discerning eyes.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
That you're not tricked
by superficiality,

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
not fooled by
lip service or by ideals,

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
that the truth is what matters
more than anything else!

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
And that you truly see and
value her for who she is!

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
Let's show her that she matters!

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
If you have already chosen
a candidate to vote for,

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
then I won't try
and change your mind.

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.099 position:50% align:center
If nothing else,

00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
I hope I've entertained
you with my bragging.

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.269 position:50% align:center
This may be a little
unconventional,

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
but once voting is over,
regardless of outcome,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.607 position:50% align:center
get to know Mayumi...

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Greet her, talk to her,
and by all means,

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
please do become
friends with her!

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
That's all!

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
Have a beautiful day!!

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] In the end, yours truly
won the election, which means...

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
I'm actually going to be

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
our next student
council president...

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[MICHIRU] So who the hell do
we think that guy was, anyway?

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
If you're saying that he wasn't

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
even a student of
Yubiwa Academy,

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
never mind one of
your classmates then...

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] It can't be ruled out
that they were an assassin

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
sent by the academy to
silence the opposition,

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
though the thought is quite
chilling.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
Overkill much?

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
I mean, like who would do that?

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.156 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm scared,
but what a mess.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO]
In any event,

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
it's a very different
political landscape

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
now than when I served,

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
wrought with new concerns
that Miss Mayumi

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
will need to
prepare herself for.

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
Mm-hmm.

00:21:30.582 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
[NAGAHIRO] It's only going
to be uphill from here.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
I didn't need be told that.

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
Plus, after all that
support from our leader,

00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
not to mention, being
shown just how many people

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
had actually voted for me.

00:21:41.092 --> 00:21:43.470 position:50% align:center
This is no time for cold feet.

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
I can't let down the people
who voted for me.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
I refuse to let them think

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
they didn't have
an eye for character.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
Petty may be petty,
but I'm going to be

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
the celestial pettiness
that glimmers.

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
I'll shine like stardust
even in the light.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
In just a few more months,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
Mr. Senpai will be done
with middle school forever.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
And our leader won't
always be a fifth grader.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.620 position:50% align:center
And as for yours truly?

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
I can't keep letting
regret define my life.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
I will look up at the
stars again, someday.

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI]
No one stays the same.

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.341 position:50% align:center
We all change.

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
Would you believe that
when I was in middle school,

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:26.721 position:50% align:center
I used to show up every day
dressed like a boy?

00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:28.014 position:50% align:center
No joke.

00:22:28.098 --> 00:22:30.850 position:50% align:center
I cooked meals for
my friends all the time.

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:33.186 position:50% align:center
And I was briefly engaged
to a grade-schooler,

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.398 position:50% align:center
so of course I was teased
relentlessly for it.

00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.691 position:50% align:center
This one year?

00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:40.026 position:50% align:center
I refused to wear anything
that wasn't shorts.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.489 position:50% align:center
Back then, I had a reputation
for being a "silent artist."

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:47.992 position:50% align:center
I played being a detective
and learned a lot from it.

00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:51.413 position:50% align:center
All these memories become
a part of who we are,

00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:52.997 position:50% align:center
and we carry them with us.

00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:54.290 position:50% align:center
The lives we live become,

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:56.126 position:50% align:center
the stories we get to tell,

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.795 position:50% align:center
and they should be beautiful.

00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.296 position:50% align:center
So, of course

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
we must live beautifully.

00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:04.342 position:50% align:center
[MANABU]
My boys!

00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.427 position:50% align:center
Do you all have some
of the orange juice

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.512 position:50% align:center
that Michiru squeezed for us?

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.055 position:50% align:center
Excellent!

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:12.434 position:50% align:center
Then let us toast, to celebrate
Mayumi's beautiful victory!

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:14.853 position:50% align:center
COWABUNGA!

00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:17.355 position:50% align:center
[MAYUMI] Cheers to
the irreplaceable present.

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:20.900 position:50% align:center
To the sharing a
single moment in time.

00:23:20.984 --> 00:23:23.028 position:50% align:center
And to seizing the day.

00:24:56.037 --> 00:25:03.128 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]
