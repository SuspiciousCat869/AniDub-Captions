WEBVTT

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.917
[GIRL] Out of the way,
impoverished one.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.458
Are you really so eager to die?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.959
[GIRL]
I said move it or die.

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:18.792
[GIRL]
For what occasion,

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:22.500
does a peasant remain on
their feet in my presence?

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.500
[GIRL] Tch!
This is why I detest mortals...

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:31.667
When I think about having

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.000
to preside over groups
of ilk like this,

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.625
it makes me wanna die.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:40.208
[GIRL] I am going to
remember your face.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:54.667
Uh, so are you like waiting
for a bus or something?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.792
Oh, Mr. Delinquent!

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.917
Okay, so what's your deal?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.250
Did something happen?

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.417
What? Who said
anything happened to me?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.834
I'm just so happy
to see your menacing face!

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.750
I really should be
apologizing for all the times

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:08.417
I've made you worry about me.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.125
[MICHIRU]
Well, then apologize.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.291
You can start by taking back

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.166
what you just said
about my face.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.583
Oh, speaking of,
Mr. Delinquent?

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.375
Do you think Sakiguchi will
be coming to the Club today?

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.792
Uhhh, Nagahiro? I dunno.

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.083
Why d'you ask?

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.750
You need something
from him specifically?

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.875
[sighs] His attendance has
been kinda terrible, lately.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:32.375
It's not really out of the
ordinary this time of year

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:34.417
seeing as he's President.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.291
And by the way how long
you gonna keep this up?

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.500
This incessant need
to call him "Sakiguchi"?

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:40.667
[MAYUMI]
Huh?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.000
[MICHIRU "Mr. Delinquent,"
"Mr. Bare-Legs,"

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.583
and let's not forget
about "Mr. Genius."

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.375
You've been giving all of us
crappy nicknames but not him.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.166
Somehow, he's the only one
you still address properly.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.917
[MAYUMI]
Well, I would, but, I mean,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.083
Sakiguchi is a
third-year student.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:55.333
I can't go around

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.875
calling an upperclassman
"Mr. Lolicon", you know?

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:00.417
Yeah, no, not what
I'm suggesting.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.583
I'm saying,
get over the age thing.

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:05.083
The Pretty Boy Detective
Club consists of our leader

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:07.792
at the top, and
then the rest of us, that's it.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:10.250
We operate as equals.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.333
Honestly, that's the only reason
you see me playing nice

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:14.208
with someone like Nagahiro.

00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:16.375
[MAYUMI]
Hmm...

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.750
Here's what I'm
thinking, Mayumi.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:21.083
If Nagahiro is around today

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:23.166
and if there's something you
want to talk to him about,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.542
here's a challenge for you.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.709
Try calling him
"Mr. President" or something.

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:29.375
[MAYUMI]
"Mr. President"?

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.041
But if I address him like that,

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.959
he'll realize
I'm making fun of him!

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.500
[MICHIRU] So you admit
you're make fun of us.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.083
[MAYUMI]
Ohh...

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.834
[MAYUMI]
It was

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:49.875
a gigantic <i>hagoita</i> .

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:57.041
[MAYUMI] An " <i>oshie-hagoita</i> "
to be precise.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:59.166
It's probably just some
new artsy masterpiece

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.000
Sosaku came up with.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.166
He doesn't recall
anything of the sort.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.792
Well, then, is it the
work of Ms. Towai?

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:09.208
Honestly, Mayumi,
I doubt that's the case.

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:11.125
Ms. Towai's been
a total outsider

00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:13.208
to this academy for years.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.041
In what world,
do you see her setting up

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.625
such a suspicious
object in the art room?

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:18.709
[MAYUMI grunts]

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.041
Yeah, I guess
that makes sense...

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:22.959
Maybe it's what's-his-name?

00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:24.500
That con artist?

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:28.000
[MAYUMI] That just doesn't
line up with Fudatsuki's M.O.

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.834
I really can't see him
being the perpetrator.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:33.083
Fudatsuki is a
high-stakes gambler.

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:36.000
No stakes, no audience,
what's the point?

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:39.500
Hah. You sure seem
to know a lot about that guy.

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:41.250
You two working
together or something?

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:42.417
[MAYUMI]
Oh, come on.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.041
"If you know the enemy
and know yourself,

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:46.875
you need not fear the result
of a hundred battles."

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.041
Don't be jealous.

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:49.875
Huh? Jealous of what?

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.917
Your philosophical bullshit?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.583
In any event, it just
doesn't sound like him.

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:56.041
I mean, the idea
of smuggling something

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.333
into enemy territory is
certainly on-brand for a gambler

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:02.792
but still, why the heck
would he send us a <i>hagoita</i> ?

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:04.583
If there's some kind
of hidden meaning to it,

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.834
it's a swing and a miss for me.

00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:08.709
I think the meaning
is quite clear!

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.375
What d'you say to this, boys?

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.375
Perchance it's a
Happy New Year's gift!

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:16.166
Maybe it's Rei?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.250
This could be the
work of the Twenties.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:19.291
[MAYUMI]
That's a theory I suspect

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.000
we can immediately dismiss.

00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:23.333
Considering the Twenties,

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:27.000
by all accounts is an
actual criminal syndicate.

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:29.250
I mean, it would be
one thing if the <i>hagoita</i>

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:33.166
was wire-tapped,
or laced with explosives...

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.583
But that's not the case,

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.083
I've already confirmed
as much with my eyes.

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:38.166
[HYOTA]
Oh, well...

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.792
That's a shame.

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:42.667
I was hoping I'd get to see
those lovely legs again.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.750
So, what?

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:45.500
Are we all out of ideas, then?

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:48.250
No new suspects
or leads to follow?

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.625
Then let's quit wasting
our time on debating.

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:53.750
We can have Nagahiro look
into it when he frees up.

00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:54.834
[MANABU]
Hmm...

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:56.834
Well, I suppose
we've discussed as much

00:07:56.917 --> 00:07:58.959
as we can without Nagahiro.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.291
So!

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.500
Why don't we proceed
to the next topic at hand?!

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:04.000
Winter break is upon us,

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.834
and I propose we hold
a winter training camp

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:07.875
for The Pretty Boy
Detective Club!

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.000
[MAYUMI]
Wait, that's it?

00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.041
We're done?

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:11.417
Am I being paranoid?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.542
I feel like this isn't a matter

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.875
we should be
shelving so quickly.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:17.834
If only there were a witness,
someone who saw

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:21.041
such a suspicious
object enter the art room?

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.041
[gasps]

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.542
That's right.

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.667
Earlier today, when I was on
my way here to the art room,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.000
I crossed paths with that
<i>yokai</i> --that <i>zashiki-warashi</i> .

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.500
What are the odds

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:34.750
that it was on it was back
from visiting this very room?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.083
[MAYUMI]
Then is it possible...

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:39.917
...that a spirit is responsible

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.625
for leaving this thing
in our company?

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:45.083
A winter training camp?

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.375
With all due respect, Leader?

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.750
Are we seriously gonna hole up
in some villa in the mountains?

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:53.000
And let me guess,
I'm cooking every meal?

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:55.959
Any idea how much work that is?

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.125
Last I checked,
I'm not your exclusive chef.

00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:00.959
Believe me, I'm all in for this

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.792
but I really can't afford
to miss every team practice,

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.667
so we may have to play
with the schedule a bit.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.166
Oh, and I guess
I'm bracing for it?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.125
But can we try to avoid
really cold places?

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:13.458
If I get goosebumps,

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:16.667
it will just ruin
my beautiful legs!

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.041
[MAYUMI]
Um...

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.542
Can I say something?

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.291
Yes, Mayumi Dojima?

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.709
If you have specific needs
for the winter training camp,

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:25.583
by all means speak your heart!

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:28.542
Actually, I was going to add
something about the <i>hagoita</i> .

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:31.750
Oh my, you don't say.
Still on about that, are we?

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:33.166
You're fixated!

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.000
Hey! What's up, Mayumi?

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:37.000
It's pretty obvious you've
got something on your mind,

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:38.792
so let's hear it.

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.542
<i>Zashiki-warashi.</i>

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.291
I didn't say anything before,

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:45.166
but I encountered a <i>zashiki-</i>
<i>warashi</i> today on my way here...

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.792
...and the more
I think about it,

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:48.750
the more I'm convinced
that that <i>yokai</i> is responsible

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:52.291
for bringing that creepy
<i>oshie-hagoita</i> into the art room.

00:09:57.834 --> 00:09:59.041
Mayumi.

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.709
Question for you.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.375
Did that " <i>yokai</i> "
happen to call you

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.834
something like
"impoverished" or "peasant"

00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:07.625
or "uninformed"
or "scum of society"?

00:10:07.709 --> 00:10:09.291
[MAYUMI]
Umm, I think...

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:12.250
I think I remember hearing
"impoverished" and "peasant,"

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:13.792
but I don't think it
called me "uninformed"

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:15.709
or "scum of society."

00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:18.959
But there's one thing in
particular that it said to me...

00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:21.834
It was something so horrifying,
I'm racking my brain,

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:24.250
but I must have
blocked it out completely.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:25.917
It was "mortals," right?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.834
[MAYUMI]
How do they know?

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.417
Why do they know?!

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.750
Wait, do you mean to tell me

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.291
that you've both
encountered Yurika?

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.917
I'm afraid that is not "Yurika."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.583
That child's name

00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:38.750
is Kodaki Kawaike.

00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:40.709
Nagahiro's fiancée.

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:45.291
And she is no <i>yokai.</i> Perhaps a
devil is a more apt metaphor.

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:47.542
[MAYUMI]
She's a devil?

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:48.709
[MANABU]
Regrettably.

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:50.667
It appears as though
a ferocious predator

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.208
has trained their eyes upon you.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.208
[HYOTA] A lot went down before
you joined, thanks to her.

00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.709
Specifically, what happened
with the summer training camp.

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:02.041
Summer training camp?

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.709
Well, guess for one thing,

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:06.792
we never actually
ended up having one.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.542
We were forced to cancel
the thing thanks to her.

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:11.583
[MAYUMI] Sounds like
there's a story there...

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:12.709
Shame, really.

00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:14.125
Though I suppose this is a tale

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.792
best told by the
one directly involved.

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:19.792
Alas, we can go no
further without Nagahiro.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:21.458
Unless, of course...

00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:24.333
Sorry to ask but can
you run an errand for me?

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:42.125
So sorry to keep you waiting.

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:45.208
Now then... How can I help you?

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.917
[NAGAHIRO] Is that right?
And you're certain of it?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.250
I'm so sorry to hear

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:54.041
my fiancée has been
troubling you, Miss Mayumi.

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.291
Though this marriage
was arranged

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:56.959
by our parents
without consultation,

00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.041
I should have
taken the initiative

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.250
to introduce the
two of you myself.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.792
[MAYUMI]
Sure...

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:05.041
[NAGAHIRO] I'll begin with the
conclusion. This crime was,

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.166
without a doubt,
perpetrated by Miss Kodaki.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.500
And I believe I have a
solid grasp on her intent.

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.875
Prior to your
involvement with this club,

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:18.959
there were a
number of "incidents."

00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:21.166
Fortunately, it seemed
for a time that things

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.834
had finally begun to settle.

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:27.333
However, when you were permitted
to join, a part of me worried

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:30.166
that these troubles I had
believed to be behind us,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.125
would again resurface.

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:35.875
You see...

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.750
You see my fiancée.

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:41.500
A Student in class 1-A
of Yubiwa Elementary,

00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:45.542
Miss Kodaki Kawaike, was denied
entry into this very club,

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:48.792
by the selfsame leader who
welcomed you with open arms.

00:12:50.834 --> 00:12:53.250
[MAYUMI] As he whispered the
truth to me in that moment,

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:54.667
I was transfixed.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.959
Not by the revelation,
but by the sound of his voice.

00:12:58.041 --> 00:13:02.250
I'm not sure that I retained
a single thing that was said.

00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:09.333
[MAYUMI]
U-Um... Hey, Sakiguchi?

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:11.417
I realize this
may come as a surprise

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.667
and the last thing I want is
to put you on the spot...

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.583
But I can't keep doing this.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:19.875
Deny me if you must,
I'll understand.

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:24.000
I have to tell you
how I really feel!

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.417
Hang on.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.333
Is this sounding like
I'm confessing my love to him?

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.834
Wait a minute!
I take it back!

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.041
Don't get me wrong, Sakiguchi,
you're extremely handsome,

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.917
but you're not
even close to my type!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.500
I feel as if I've
been courted and dumped

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.500
in the span of a minute.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.291
[MAYUMI] Actually, there's
something I was hoping

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.792
you could help me with.

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:43.583
It has to do with
the sound of my voice...

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.083
[NAGAHIRO]
Your voice?

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:46.875
[MAYUMI]
The choir contest.

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.333
It's an event held by the
Academy at the end of each year.

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:52.875
Okay. So here's the thing...

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.792
[MAYUMI]
I haven't told anybody

00:13:56.875 --> 00:13:59.333
why I've been attending school
in a boy's uniform.

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:01.875
I guess I've just let people
assume whatever they want,

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:03.500
which is fine, but now,

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:05.375
despite sounding
the way that I do,

00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:06.458
I've been assigned to sing

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:08.709
with the male section
of our choir.

00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:10.667
Hence, my problem.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.291
As its plain to see,
I really need your help.

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:16.041
Please teach me to change the
pitch and timbre of my voice.

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.250
That way I'll be able
to sing low enough naturally

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:19.959
so as not to feel out of place!

00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:23.166
I think you're
overcomplicating this.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.542
Just explain the situation
to your class rep--

00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:28.083
they can have you
reassigned as a soprano.

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:30.000
[MAYUMI]
I would but my worry is,

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:33.375
wouldn't I run the risk of
exposing our Club's existence?

00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:37.041
[NAGAHIRO]
That is a consideration.

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.667
I suppose you're right.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.166
Here is my proposal.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.375
As it seems I have troubled you
with my fiancée's conduct,

00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:44.792
I will agree to train you

00:14:44.875 --> 00:14:47.667
so that you may develop
the voice of your desires.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.583
That is, I have one condition.

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.917
[MAYUMI]
Oh? Ohhhhh.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.125
Huh?

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:55.709
Did he...

00:14:55.792 --> 00:14:58.917
Did he say unconditionally?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.834
Miss Mayumi. In exchange
for my earnest tutelage,

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:05.333
I'd like you to make a genuine
effort to befriend Miss Kodaki.

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:08.500
You see, she hasn't
made any friends.

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:10.000
[MAYUMI]
Okay...?

00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:12.667
But I haven't made
any friends here either...

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.125
What do you think, Nagahiro?

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:21.792
Does this look like something
Kodaki might have created?

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:23.834
[NAGAHIRO]
This is almost undoubtedly hers.

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:26.375
As always, I haven't a clue
what she was attempting

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.250
to capture with this piece.

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:33.500
Perhaps this monstrosity echoes
her emotional landscape.

00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.792
In any event,
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:39.166
And I'm sorry my personal matter
has cast a shadow on our Club.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.792
Oh no, I don't mind at all.

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:43.542
There are no such thing as
"personal matters" here.

00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:45.291
In the Pretty Boy
Detective Club,

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.792
we face adversity together!

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:53.709
[MAYUMI] Do you think it's
possible that Yurika...

00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:56.709
Oh, sorry, I mean, Kodaki
was eager for another chance

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:59.583
to join the club and so
she created this <i>hagoita</i>

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.583
as a kind of functional resume?

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:03.208
I must say,
it's quite generous of you

00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:05.917
to assume positive intent,
Miss Mayumi.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.667
I don't know, that doesn't
feel right to me, either.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.959
Though I might
have been in agreement

00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.709
if you had said it was
a declaration of war.

00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:15.250
[MAYUMI]
A declaration of war...

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:17.041
No, wait, isn't there a meaning

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:20.500
behind sending
someone a <i>hagoita</i> ?

00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:22.333
[NAGAHIRO]
Well, regardless of her intent,

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:24.959
nevertheless, we find ourselves
"saddled with a paddle,"

00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:28.834
as it were, and we are going to
have to do something about this.

00:16:28.917 --> 00:16:30.500
Though, in a perfect world,

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:33.000
she would simply
come back and reclaim it.

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:35.875
That certainly be the most
appropriate resolution

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.375
provided in doing so,
she took responsibility.

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:39.834
I don't think
there's a chance in hell

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:42.542
that devil girl will listen
to a word we have to say.

00:16:42.625 --> 00:16:44.667
It'll be fine, Michiru.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.125
I have a great idea
that addresses that point.

00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:48.709
[MAYUMI]
And I have a sneaking suspicion

00:16:48.792 --> 00:16:52.750
that I'm going to be at the
center of this "great idea"...

00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.041
It's decided!

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:55.333
We'll have Nagahiro
take the lead

00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:57.709
and handle all the negotiations.

00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.083
No small feat,

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:00.458
as you'll be entreating
one of few people upon which

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:03.875
your beautiful voice has
no effect, but I have faith!

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:06.709
I would say that's about
all we can do for now,

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:09.875
however there's one
other detail to consider.

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.041
That <i>hagoita</i> is
of formidable size

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:13.583
and can't be easy to move.

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.166
So how in the world

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.000
was that irredeemable girl able
to get it to this art room?

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:19.500
Unless we figure this out,

00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:21.500
there's no telling
how soon we can expect

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.417
another infiltration or
what she'll leave behind.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.667
And next time,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.375
it may not be suspicious
it could be dangerous.

00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:33.208
[MICHIRU]
You think so?

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.625
It doesn't strike me
as much of a mystery.

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.125
She probably used a cart
or something, you know?

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.750
[MAYUMI]
There's no way she used a cart.

00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:42.000
This campus is
full of staircases.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:45.625
And anyway, even if she
somehow resolved that issue

00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:48.083
having now delivered the
<i>hagoita</i> to the art room,

00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:49.500
she'd still have the cart,

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:50.917
so she would have
needed to take the cart

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.458
with her when she left.

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:53.333
But!

00:17:53.417 --> 00:17:54.792
When she crossed paths with me,

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:57.375
the <i>zashiki-warashi</i>
was empty-handed!

00:17:57.458 --> 00:17:58.417
How's that?

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.750
Why does it seem
like you get excited

00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:02.542
shooting down
someone else's theory?

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:05.083
Are you sure you're not
Kodaki Kawaike in disguise?

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:08.000
She wouldn't have asked anyone
to carry it for her, right?

00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:09.583
That doesn't seem like her.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.166
Even if the possibility exists,

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.041
considering that
girl's personality,

00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:18.041
I highly doubt
she'd ask for help.

00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:20.125
Besides tactically speaking,

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:22.291
doesn't she risk drawing
even more attention to herself

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:25.041
by increasing the number
of perpetrators involved?

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:26.417
Okay, so does that mean

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.125
that it's impossible
for Yurika to have done it?

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:32.792
[NAGAHIRO] No, there is no doubt
in my mind she is the culprit.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:34.792
On this point, I am unwavering.

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:36.208
I will say it again,

00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:39.834
that <i>oshie-hagoita</i> was
created by Miss Kodaki.

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:42.583
[MAYUMI]
With that in mind,

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.208
we currently have two mysteries

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:46.125
before us that need solving.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.875
Why did Kodaki do such a thing?

00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:52.375
And how did Kodaki
do such a thing?

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:54.709
[MICHIRU] Nagahiro will
approach her personally

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:57.083
so that should take care
of the motive question.

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.834
Meanwhile, it's
our job to figure out

00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:01.834
how it would be possible to
pull something like that off...

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:04.417
...for someone as
small as her, I mean.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.542
So, first thing
that comes to mind

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:08.959
is you just don't bring
in the completed item.

00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:10.750
Instead, why not
bring it in in pieces,

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:11.917
and then you can assemble it

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.417
once you've got everything
in the art room?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.083
[MAYUMI] Sorry, but that's
impossible, Mr. Delinquent.

00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:20.166
That thing is
on one solid board.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.709
That <i>hagoita</i> is constructed
in a shape and size

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:26.917
that is far too big
for a child to carry.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.333
[HYOTA] First of all, can that
thing even fit through the door?

00:19:30.417 --> 00:19:33.750
And second, maybe it's
hollow and really light.

00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:35.125
[MAYUMI] Well,
one way we could find out,

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:37.000
would be to try picking it up,

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:38.583
and then see if we could
fit through the door

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:40.041
with it in one piece.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:42.542
That would take care
of both concerns, right?

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:45.959
The question is who
would be willing to do it?

00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:49.333
Does anyone actually
want to touch that?

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:52.834
[MAYUMI] It stands to reason
that the least powerful member

00:19:52.917 --> 00:19:55.458
of the Club should be
the one to do it.

00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:57.875
Hey, Lead--

00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:00.041
Nope. I will do it.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:01.333
[shudders]

00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:04.083
The leader is loved way
too much in this group.

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:05.792
[MANABU]
Hmm?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.667
Somebody, give me a hand!

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.500
This is crazy heavy!

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:15.667
"Damsel in distress" much?

00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:20.417
Hey! This is much easier!

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.917
I can really count on you!

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.709
[MICHIRU] Don't even think
about playing "big sister"

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:26.625
after pulling that
damsel crap before.

00:20:26.709 --> 00:20:29.250
All right little further.

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:45.500
[MAYUMI] It fit through
the door pretty easily.

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:47.041
Huh...

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:48.709
How about we put this
on the table for now

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:50.458
and inspect it?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.083
[HYOTA] I say we take
the whole thing apart

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:54.458
and turn over
every piece for clues.

00:20:54.542 --> 00:20:57.333
Wait, but didn't
we just figure out

00:20:57.417 --> 00:20:59.291
that we can fit this
through the door as is?

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:00.750
Even so, if we take it apart,

00:21:00.834 --> 00:21:03.417
there's a chance
we'll find something!

00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:07.500
[MAYUMI] As an artist himself,
he can't overlook

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:10.000
the destruction of
someone else's work.

00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:13.291
Wait, why is he telling me
this and not Mr. Bare Legs?

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.333
I'm not the one standing here

00:21:14.417 --> 00:21:16.917
asking us to take
the thing apart!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.333
[MANABU]
Hmmm.

00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:22.000
It seems as if today's
discussion has come to an end.

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:24.208
I'd rather not spend
too much time on this,

00:21:24.291 --> 00:21:27.375
so let's reconvene
bright and early.

00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:29.000
Everyone aside from Nagahiro,

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:32.166
I expect nothing short
of a beautiful theory!

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.875
How did Kodaki Kawaike manage

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:37.208
to bring this giant
<i>oshie-hagoita</i> into this room?

00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:38.917
Oh, and before I forget,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.375
please think about
where you'd like to go

00:21:40.458 --> 00:21:43.125
for the training camp
and make you requests.

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:46.208
And with that,
we're disbanding for today!

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:21.375
[MAYUMI groans]

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.375
[MAYUMI yawns]

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:31.959
Such an unflattering posture.

00:23:34.583 --> 00:23:36.166
Maidservant.
