WEBVTT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.442
Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission to save New

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:10.610
Vestroia.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.645
We joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.747
Resistance.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.849
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.052
So we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.221
But first Drago and I had to prove ourselves to the

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.824
Resistance's hotshot Brawler; Ace!

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.726
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.628
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.730
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.801
Next stop, Alpha City, New Vestroia!

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:45.945
[\u266a]

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:55.588
[\u266a]

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.642
Ta-daa!

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.014
So, whaddya think?

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.749
It seems to fit you just fine.

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.984
That uniform looks awesome on you!

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.086
[chuckling] You got that right, man.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.756
This stuff fits like it was made for me.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.258
The better you look the better you brawl.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.694
Hey, if you're passing compliments around,

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.829
how about some for me?

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.430
Wow, lookin' sharp, dude!

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.998
[embarrassed laugh]

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:43.770
Lucky for me you guys had this uniform in junior size

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.573
You may be small...But you got all the right stuff,

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.874
Marucho.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:51.377
Ok let's move on...Dan, you can't just battle with Drago.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.714
Thanks, Mira.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.516
These are cool but I won't be needing them.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.051
Drago isn't enough.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.919
I need some back up, Dan.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.155
There is strength in numbers.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.156
What?

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.024
[gentle laugh] Now do you see my point?

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.860
[embarrassed chuckle] Yeah, I guess.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.294
Sorry about that, Drago.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.230
Is there a Bakugan for me?

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:14.567
Sorry, Marucho...I had all of my Pyrus Bakugan taken

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.569
from me in my last battle.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.572
[gasp] That's all right, Mira.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.040
Hey, Marucho.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.676
Don't worry about it...I'll get those Pyrus Bakugan back

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.746
the next time I battle the Vexos. Got it?

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.849
In that case, I'll be there to cheer you on, Dan.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.052
Now before we meet the Vexos,

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.321
let's get in some heavy-duty training.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.625
And I'm just the guy to lead it, too...Whaddya say?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.229
...You mean you would train me?

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.532
That would be funny to watch...

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.233
But then, who would train you, Dan?

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.235
We can all train together.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.305
This is like a dream come true...My personal trainer is

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.208
going to be Daaaaaaaaaan... Thank you, Master

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.976
...Thank you so much...

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.679
I promise I won't let you down!

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.714
[\u266a]

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:05.118
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Get Psyched!\"

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.720
[\u266a]

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:10.123
Tell us another one of your stories, Master Dan!

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.158
How about when you and the other Brawlers helped Drago

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.260
to become part of the core?

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.762
I can't get enough of that one!

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.297
Or what about that time Marucho mentioned where you

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.831
threw Drago in the river?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.300
Hey! Give me a break... I'm hungry. Baron, give the guy some space.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.467
Seriously.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.636
I try and then I start thinking...What happens when

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.039
you teach me all of your secrets and I become an even

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.207
better Brawler than you are?

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.579
Then I'll be the mightiest Brawler in the universe!

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:36.516
...Those Vexos will run when they see me coming!

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.351
Sorry Baron, but the most powerful thing about you

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.719
right now is your mouth.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.820
Huh, what was that?

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.855
If you spent as much energy practicing as you do

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.991
talking, you'd be a master Brawler now.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.526
No way...

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.927
How could you say that?

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:49.562
Don't listen to her, Baron...You're totally doing

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.797
fine.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.931
Right Drago?

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.766
She does have a point.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.436
Okay then...We'll show them you've got what it takes

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.505
together. And you can bet I won't go easy on you, Baron.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.707
OK?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.774
Yes!

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.376
Your word is my command.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.244
Come on. Lighten up. That was a joke.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.479
[laugh]

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.158
[bored sigh]

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.194
Spectra, I it's time we did something

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.395
about them.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.596
Don't you think?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.531
I am already on it, sire.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:33.139
[\u266a]

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.341
[throat clearing] Where do you think you're going?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.645
Shadow...

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.313
You're up to something and I want to know exactly what it

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.650
is...You wouldn't be hoggin' all the fun? Would you?

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.318
Don't be such a child.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.086
I'm on the hunt for the Resistance.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.488
Ooh. I want in on that.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.456
It's been way too boring around here.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.759
Why don't you take me along for the ride?

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.595
[crazy laugh]

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.997
...Come on!

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.833
If you insist.

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.535
[yawn]

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.804
Baron reporting for training, sir!

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:07.573
It's pretty early...but let's get going!

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.442
Okay! Gauntlet Power Strike!

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.512
Gate Card set!

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:14.914
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.216
Bakugan Stand!

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.521
This should be interesting.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:27.927
[\u266a]

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.863
[big breath] Get psyched! Get psyched! Get psyched!

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:34.434
[battle roar]

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.569
The most important thing in winning a battle is getting

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.037
psyched for it.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.239
Let's see what you've got! Ready?

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.942
Get psyched! Get psyched! Get psyched! Get psyched!

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.010
Get psyched! Get psyched!

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:45.712
Is it gonna be like this every time he brawls?

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:46.846
Hope not.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.514
[embarrassed laugh]

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.583
[sigh] Sorry Nemus.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.619
These humans, they do funny things.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.288
I understand.

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.890
Bakugan cannot be responsible for their brawlers.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.893
Get psyched! Get psyched! Get psyched! Get psyched!

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.095
Get psyched! Get psyched!

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.529
Mind you, I haven't seen Baron this excited and

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.531
confident in a long while.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.899
Really?

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.768
Sooner or later he's gonna find out the truth about me.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.637
Wow.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:13.072
Baron's really getting pumped!

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.742
I'm an even better teacher than I thought.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.977
I'm sorry, I can't train with you.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.546
Yeah! Stay psyched! Keep it up!

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.250
Whaaaaa? What are you talking about?

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.952
It's just that I don't deserve to battle with

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:28.521
someone of your skill and bravery, sir.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.790
That's a pretty warped thing to say.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:33.292
I'm just not worthy.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.230
I'm so sorry!

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.766
You see, it's all my fault what happened to Tigrerra!

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.067
Tigrerra?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.104
We were brawling with Spectra.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.339
I lost my nerve.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.074
And then I lost Tigrerra!

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.242
I had no idea.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.613
That makes it even more important for you to get

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.281
back in action, dude!

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.483
To battle and win back Tigrerra.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.986
But if I lose again they'll take Nemus from me.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.554
I couldn't stand that!

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.655
[gasp]

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.457
Remember you lose your Bakugan...

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.559
when the difference in power levels between the two

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.761
Bakugan is more than five hundred.

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.596
I couldn't risk that again, Dan.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.831
Could you?

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.834
I know it's tough but ...you gotta try.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.369
No way!

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.971
I'd rather just hand over Nemus than to lose him in battle.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.239
You don't mean that...

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.407
He does.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.676
So save us the grief and just run away now!

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.913
Think you're going to free the Bakugan with that attitude?

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.448
We can't afford to have you in the Resistance if you are

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.884
just going to give up.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.387
Don't you think that's pretty harsh, Mira?

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.190
The poor guy needs to get his confidence back.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:38.925
Let's calm down!

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.228
An experience like that is bound to shake a guy's confidence.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.030
If Dan works with him I bet Baron will

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.264
be back to his old self.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.700
Ah come on. Lighten up, Mira.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:50.336
I mean, you know what it's like to lose a Bakugan too.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.637
We're all in this together.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:54.140
We have to work as a team.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.441
My point, exactly.

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.442
What?

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:59.178
A team is only as strong...

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:02.849
...as its weakest member.

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.517
Baron...

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.918
What do you think, Nemus.

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.420
Are you willing to take a chance?

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.487
I am.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.089
But it's not up to me.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.124
Baron is the one who must decide.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.061
And I must obey.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:17.063
Dan and I are partners.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:19.532
We have equal say on all decisions.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:33.045
[crash]

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.881
[\u266a]

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:37.617
Shouldn't we run...!?

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.985
Nice landing.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.723
[maniacal laugh]

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.692
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.294
[impact]

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:51.364
[effort]

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:54.500
[relief and crazy laugh]

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.103
You imbecile...Must everything be a joke with

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:58.404
you Shadow?

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:59.972
What a rush!

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:01.774
Mylene! ...Shadow!

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:02.975
What's up?

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.043
Who's that?

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.078
More of the Vexos.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.414
[maniacal, mocking laugh]

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.383
Surpriiiise!

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.484
[\u266a]

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:12.885
Hang tight, Battle Brawlers...

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.287
We'll be right back.

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.722
Gate Card Set!

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.257
It's time to Brawl!

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.961
So who's got the guts to battle me?

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.297
How about you, human?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.665
Big mistake guys...

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.366
Let's get this party started.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.434
Not you...

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:29.735
Let Baron take him on.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.170
Huh?

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:32.805
Did I hear you right?

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.074
No, no. I don't mind. Dan can handle this one.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.343
This is your chance to prove your worth, Baron...

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:40.279
Are you ready to jam or ready to run?

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:41.747
Mira!

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.316
Chill out, Mira.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:47.286
Hey Ace, don't you think she should cut Baron some slack?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.155
So what's it going to be?

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.423
Battle Shadow?

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:53.693
Or run away with your tail between your legs?

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.195
...But what if I lose Nemus?

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.232
It is up to you, Baron.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.768
I would battle beside you any day.

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.470
You-you would?

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:05.705
Of course.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:08.808
I believe in you.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.909
Okay...

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.677
We'll do it together.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:17.249
[yawn] This one's not even worth my time.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.551
You want him, Mylene?

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:19.652
No way.

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.120
I'll leave the small fry to you.

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:23.255
Aw, come on!

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.591
How come I get the lame battles?

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.326
Then finish him quick.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.861
Ready whimpus?

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.396
Gauntlet...

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:33.132
...Power Strike!

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:35.768
Alright... Gate Card...

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.837
Set!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.439
Darkus Anchosaurus...

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:43.909
Bakugan Stand!

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:46.345
[roar]

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.015
...He can taste your fear!

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.117
Baron, let's go!

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.184
Huh?

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:54.153
Trying to ignore my invitation?

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:55.221
Ha!

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.722
That's not very polite.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.225
Here, I'll make you battle!

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:02.294
[attack roar] Shock Down!

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.998
[surprise, pain] Haos Jelldan, No!

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.336
[bulbous, watery, surprised roar]

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.371
His Bakugan flew out of his hand!

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.707
Shock Down ability drags out an opponent's weakest

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.778
Bakugan whether it wants to battle or not.

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:19.945
And that ain't all...

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.781
Power loss detected That ability's dragging Haos

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:24.083
Jelldon's Power Level down!

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.217
Oh no!

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.886
Run Jelldon!

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:29.221
[crazed laughter] Don't bother!

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.533
At least Jelldon wasn't taken away.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.635
You can't sit back and play defense, Baron.

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.003
Attack!

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:46.872
You're playing like you've already given up!

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.407
Gate Card Set!

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:53.245
Baron, leave this one to me!

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.450
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:01.854
Haos Rafflesian!

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.522
Baron, please!

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.091
Ability Activate!

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.559
Glow Shield now!

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.128
A shield?

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.362
Ya gotta be kiddin'?

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.965
If you're not gonna battle like a grown-up, run along,

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.100
little boy!

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.236
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.838
Bakugan Stand!

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.106
Darkus Hammersaur!

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:26.812
No! He destroyed my ability by Standing his Bakugan?

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:29.415
Forget it... Counterattack, Baron!

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.584
Gate Card, Open!

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.985
Haos Reactor!

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.387
That raises Rafflesian's points by a hundred!

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.057
And now... Ability Activate!

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.359
Mirror window!

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:42.128
As long as Mirror Window is active,

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.431
Hammersaur can't use any of his abilities, so there!

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:48.834
[annoyed growl]...

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.002
And oh yeah...

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.837
The more you try to crush through Mirror Window the

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.439
more damage you do to yourself!

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:56.408
[growling]

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.843
Whaaat?

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:58.844
Good move!

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.346
You've got him now, Baron!

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.114
But not for long...

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.483
Bakugan Stand!

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.285
Hey! No fair!

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.386
[shocked gasp]

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:08.554
Who's talkin' fair?

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.322
Anchorsaur will shatter Mirror Window.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.790
Just your bad luck!

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.459
Let's go, Anchorsaur!

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:15.161
Ability Activate!

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.962
Magnerius!

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.334
[roar]

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:24.803
Ability Activate!

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:26.672
Crush hurricane!

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.841
I'll take Rafflesian now!

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:31.443
[manic, crazed laugh]

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.179
That's a powerful attack!

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:35.014
The difference in power level between them is more

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.815
than 500!

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.384
Hands off Rafflesian!

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:39.985
Ability Activate!

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.086
Flow Gloa!

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.821
[defiant cry]

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.691
That should be just enough!

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.729
[relieved sigh]

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.365
He managed to keep Rafflesian...

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.134
But he lost two battles.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.403
And if he loses again...

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.804
No way...

00:13:58.837 --> 00:13:59.839
You ready, Drago?

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.473
No Dan. I'm not...

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.776
This is Baron's fight to win or lose.

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:05.311
But Drago...

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.982
Baron doesn't need to prove anything to me.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.885
But he needs to prove something to himself!

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.887
You can do it!

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.355
Mira...

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:17.690
believes.

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.958
Of course she believes in him.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.659
She believes in the whole team.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.094
Don't you see, Dan?

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:24.263
That's why she was pushing so hard.

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.731
I get it, Marucho.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.132
What Baron needs...

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.468
is for all of us to believe in him too!

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.469
Yo, Baron!

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:34.506
Listen! Stop protecting Nemus and battle!

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.574
...I can't.

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.810
Nemus! It's time to speak up.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:39.645
Tell Baron how you feel!

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:41.513
You're his partner!

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.451
But I...I don't know how.

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.453
You're breaking my heart, really!

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:49.021
But I'm getting bored!

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.990
You've still got a battle to lose.

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:53.859
It's time now for the main event.

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:56.795
[manic cackle] Gate Card Set!

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.464
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:58.497 --> 00:14:59.632
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.967
Darkus Atchibee.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:03.669
[threatening squeal]

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.170
[fearful gasp] It's no use!

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.740
I can't win against Atchibee, Nemus!

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:10.409
And if I lose, that mean's you'll be taken...

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.877
like Tigrerra!

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.846
[roar]

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.648
Baron, I understand.

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.249
But we can still free Tigrerra...

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.685
It's just... Well...

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:22.755
You can't win or lose if you don't battle!

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:23.989
Ah? Yeah!

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.758
We're in this together.

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:28.160
Nemus...

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:29.561
You are right.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.096
Ok! Let's do it!

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.132
Win or lose we'll battle together and protect each

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.233
other!

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.634
That's what I wanted to hear!

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.369
Now let's go!

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:38.704
Alright Kick it!

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.040
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.574
Bakugan Stand!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.043
Nemus!

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:48.113
Now we're talking!

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:51.183
[battle growl]

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.851
Field Open.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:56.188
[mocking laugh] Finally giving up Nemus?

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.290
I'll add him to my collection.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.026
Nobody touches Nemus on my watch.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.028
Ability Activate!

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.630
Raven Lore!

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.099
Ability Card Set.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.201
Another lame attack...

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:10.602
Try this on for size.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.404
Ability Activate!

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.440
Vermillion Jet Black!

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.275
[battle roar]

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:20.145
[Gasp!]

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.214
What's happening?

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.949
[pain cry] Nemus Power Level 250.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:26.952
Yeh! How's it feel to be useless?

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.287
[manic laugh]

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.488
Ability Activate!

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:32.524
Shade Cocoon.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.326
Yes!

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.832
What did Baron just do?

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:43.635
Shade Cocoon is a special ability only Nemus can use...

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.205
It allows him to completely shut down his opponent's

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.639
abilities.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.642
I don't need any abilities to defeat you.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.745
Hammersaur Stand!

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:55.514
No! He's ganging up on Nemus!

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.882
That dude's hardcore!

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.617
Baron, do something now!

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.852
Not yet Dan.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.653
It has to be when the time is right.

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:04.223
But you've got to hold on Nemus!

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:08.026
I'll hold, Baron! [defiant grunt]

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.495
Now we've got a party!

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:13.065
Let's invite Anchorsaur!

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.466
Power Level doubled.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.870
Oh no! The difference in power levels is 750 points!

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.071
Baron!

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.239
It's over!

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.907
Oh it's over all right...

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.776
It all comes down to this...

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.412
No more running away, Nemus!

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:28.113
One last attack!

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:30.082
One last chance to win!

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.950
I'm with you Baron!

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.053
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.421
Flow Skylight!

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:37.990
Power Level transfer complete.

00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.024
What?

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.160
You took their combined power!

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:44.163
Light of the majestic sky, release my friends from

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.531
captivity!

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.932
Haaa!

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.235
My life meter!

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.804
It's dropped to zero, but how?

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.072
Game over!

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.506
Wow! Isn't it awesome?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.542
Alright!

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.311
Flow Skylight is a fusion ability that can only be

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:01.580
used when Shade Cocoon is active.

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:04.550
But it can only be activated once when the power level

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:07.486
difference is over 500 points!

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.922
[disbelieving gasp] You mean you faked me out?

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.458
So you had to bring Nemus to the brink of defeat in order

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.460
to activate Flow Skylight.

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.028
That's serious brawling!

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.597
You had to risk the very thing you were most afraid

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.332
to lose in order to win.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:24.470
You took a chance, Baron and won by more than 500 points.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.406
You freed three Bakugan at once!

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.041
And you wanted to give it all up.

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:30.175
No fair!

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:31.577
I'm the one who's supposed to cheat,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.945
not the Resistance!

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:35.214
You are an overconfident nimskrit.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.548
I am not!

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:37.716
Oh man up.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.018
This is your loss and you're taking the blame for it.

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.320
Get in the ship.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.721
We're going and this time...

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:43.956
I'm driving.

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:47.392
I can't believe how bossy you are.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:53.265
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.501
You did it, Baron.

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.969
I did... Didn't I?

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:58.337
What did I tell you?

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.738
It's all about getting psyched!

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.274
Then you battle with everything you've got!

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.142
Oh yeah! I was totally psyched!

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.678
But I couldn't have done it if Nemus hadn't trusted me,

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.280
hung in there the way he did.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.915
It was nothing.

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.850
I knew you would not let me down.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.218
We are partners.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.454
A team to the end.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.755
Nemus!

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.424
[happy laugh] That's the nicest thing a Bakugan has

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.893
ever said to me.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.794
Not so tight. Let me breathe.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.597
[joyous laugh]

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.001
I guess we don't need Master Dan and

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:31.303
Drago anymore, do we?

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.840
Nemus and I, we can free all the Bakugan ourselves!

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:36.775
Hey! I've still got lots to teach you.

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.244
So drop and give me twenty push-ups!

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:50.289
[\u266a]

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:52.391
Hey Mira!

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.760
Hey! What are you doing all alone out here?

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:55.827
We're ready to go.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.062
Okay.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.397
You were unbelievable today...

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.699
You really push the edge, you know?

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:03.268
Seriously, you pushed Baron to a new level.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.840
Thank you. I learned how to lead from my brother.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:11.109
Oh!

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:14.112
So is that him?

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.248
You know that day I found out the Bakugan were

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.849
intelligent beings?

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.551
[pained, defiant roaring]

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:20.819
Miss Mira... This way...

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:23.655
Hey! [effort]

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.190
My brother was there.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.925
I saw him.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.394
But he disappeared and I ran off.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.196
I started the Bakugan Brawler Resistance,

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:33.265
and I haven't seen him since.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:34.633
That's intense.

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.935
I have no idea where he is now.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:41.406
But.. I know he's somewhere in New Vestroia.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.111
And he's fighting to free the Bakugan, just like I am.

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:49.114
And we'll find each other some day.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.349
You bet...

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.717
Mira? Master Dan?

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.185
Where are you guys?

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:54.987
Get it in gear or we'll leave without you!

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.023
Then I get to be in charge!

00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:00.759
[laugh]

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.628
Come on, guys!

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:05.430
Stay cool Baron, we're coming.

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:07.933
Marucho here!

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:10.902
I know Dan and Drago are the greatest Bakugan Brawlers in

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.773
the universe but they're gonna need my help.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:17.509
But what can I do without Preyus?

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.278
Of course, finding a Bakugan is only half the battle.

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.648
I still have to prove myself to her before she's willing

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.416
to be my partner.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:28.186
Then Mylene revives a powerful ancient Bakugan to

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.088
take us down!

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.591
I hope my lucky stars are watching over me.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.026
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.794
You don't want to miss this one!

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:45.871
[\u266a]

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:55.514
[\u266a]
