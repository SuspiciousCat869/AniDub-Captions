WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.074
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.176
to save New Vestroia.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.346
We joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.749
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:18.551
So we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.920
But first Drago and I had to prove ourselves

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.457
to the Resistance's hotshot Brawler; Ace!

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.960
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension Controllers

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.728
to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.697
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.435
Next stop, Alpha City, New Vestroia!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.271
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.674
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.710
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:44.978
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.746
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.114
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.949
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.284
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.386
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.190
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.996
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.497
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.267
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.802
Ability activate!

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.703
Burning Dragon!

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.206
[roar]

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.508
Not so fast, \"master\".

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.477
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.312
Ability Activate!

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.580
Skid Roa!

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.816
Give me your best shot!

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.355
[roar]

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.159
Ha ha!

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.694
[whistles] That's enough!

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.138
Why do you get so psyched over practice?

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.674
They get psyched over everything.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.842
And why not?

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.276
I love to brawl...

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.444
Right Drago?

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.313
DRAGO: Truer words were never spoken.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.114
That was awesome, Master Dan!

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.684
I freaked when you pulled out Burning Dragon.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.118
You had some pretty good moves...

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.921
You really had me on my toes there.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.991
I'm next in line for a little practice, alright?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.292
Hey, sounds good to me.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.561
DRAGO: It would be an honour.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.063
[chatter]

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.999
Hey guys. What's everybody talking about, huh?

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.235
DAN: ...we've got to be in major shape.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.769
And that doesn't just mean practicing.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.972
It means pushing each other to the limit every time.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.344
[THINKING]: Preyas, I miss you so much.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.348
[laughter]

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.149
Don't worry Preyas...

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.784
I'll win you back.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.955
I just need to find a Bakugan

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.924
who will battle with me...

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.526
But where?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.195
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.097
in \"Marucho's Mission\".

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:59.646
[\u266a]

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.116
MYLENE: What useless Bakugan, you are.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.517
Beg all you want.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.585
It's no use.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.554
I can't be bothered to keep you...

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:08.955
Now be gone.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.658
Please have mercy on us, Mylene!

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.359
JELLDAN: We're just little Baku...

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.460
Ow!

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.131
Now that I've finally put out the garbage...

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.334
I think I'm in the mood for a little Bakugan hunting.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.936
Don't just stand there.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.672
Prepare for my departure, you fools!

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:35.748
[\u266a]

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:44.791
[\u266a]

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:45.925
It's not stealing...

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.294
if I bring it back.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.200
[THINKING]: Please forgive me, everybody,

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:57.170
but I can't go on just watching as all of you fight

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.205
to save New Vestroia.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.408
I can't stand being the only one who can't help.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.444
Somewhere out there is a Bukugan

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.446
who will be my partner.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.648
And I'm going to find him!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.323
[groaning] I'm so hungry.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.525
I wish I'd packed a lunch.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.830
Preyas, are you there?

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.698
I'm always by your side, Marucho,

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.267
so hang in there...

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.434
Hang in there...

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.669
Hang in there.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.571
I miss you Preyas!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.239
Okay!

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.575
I promise to find a new Bakugan partner

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.011
so I can save you and the others.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.812
PREYAS: We'll be waiting.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.584
What's that?

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.292
There's got to be something I can eat around here,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.660
but where?

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.762
This place is weirding me out.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.164
I feel like I'm being watched.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.771
A Bakugan!

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.573
Ahh!

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.277
Somebody help me!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.080
Is there anybody around who can help me?

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:16.149
Well, well, what do we have here?

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:19.152
It doesn't look like a rabbit.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.788
Oh it's just a child.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.757
What is it doing wandering around Elfin's forest?

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:25.925
Hello there...

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.160
I'm Marucho.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.795
I'm looking for something to eat.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.130
Marucho. That's a funny name.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.766
Not nearly as pretty as Elfin.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.035
Oh... Elfin?

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.136
You're right.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.504
That's a prettier name than Marucho.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.872
Flatterer.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:40.873
Wait.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.775
Where have I heard that name before?

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.744
Marucho. Oh... I know!

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.613
Did you have a Bukugan named Preyas?

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:51.751
[gasp] How do you know Preyas?

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.087
DAN: Maybe I didn't hear you right.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.756
We have to go look for Marucho!

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.859
We just don't have time to go looking for a deserter...

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.327
He's history now.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.361
Deserter?

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.996
You're gonna pay for that!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.832
Come on, chill.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.633
DRAGO: Calm down, Dan.

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.302
Maucho's no deserter.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.837
Look! He took a gauntlet.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.406
That means he's going to come back.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.607
When I see it.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.742
Ace!

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.777
MIRA: Dan, we all understand how you feel.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.346
But right now we have more pressing priorities

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.248
than finding Marucho...

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:24.183
We must focus...

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.053
on Destroying the Dimension Controller at Alpha...

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.521
DAN: Don't underestimate Marucho.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:31.390
He'll be back with a new Aquos Bakugan.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.028
Thank you for the delicious lunch but could you tell me

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.563
how you know Preyas?

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:39.699
Before he was taken by the Vestel people,

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:43.703
he told me all about Earth and the Battle Brawlers.

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.037
He was my Bakugan...

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.706
And my best friend.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.108
Oooh that Preyas was a real charmer.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.010
It was love at first sight.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:55.148
My name is Preyas and I'm here to rock your world!

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.316
Oh he was so dreamy...

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.685
It sounds like Preyas is popular.

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.522
Everyone was very sad when he was captured.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.690
And that left the Wantu vulnerable to attack

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:07.527
so I've had to take over their protection.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.028
MARUCHO: The Wantu?

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:12.231
Yes, the little Bakugan of the forest.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.700
I wish Preyas was here.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.703
I know...

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.939
Elfin, I need a favour from you.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.140
A favour?

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.408
What is it?

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:25.178
I need to battle the Vexos and save New Vestroia...

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.346
Will you be my partner?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.548
What?

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.049
Come on.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.751
We'd be great together, don't you think?

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.787
You're not exactly what I had in mind.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.689
Let's save Preyas.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:44.831
[\u266a]

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:47.533
Umm... I don't think so.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:48.568
Whaaaa?

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.735
You're not exactly what I imagined

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.871
in a partner, Marucho.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.239
Hi!

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.774
My name is Marucho

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.943
And I'll rock your world!

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:00.213
That's way too smooth for me Elfin.

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.647
I'm holding out for a battle brawler

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.216
who's super good looking

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:06.118
and knows how to show a Bakugan a real good time!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.787
Good time?

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.389
But this is what Preyas would want.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.491
How do you know?

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.262
Preyas and I are as close as a Bakugan and Brawler can be...

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:19.532
He's counting on me to save the Bakugan.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.467
Since you put it that way...

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.970
Okay, if you pass the tests

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.772
I'll think about a temporary partnership.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.074
What tests?

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:30.142
Oh, nothing too strenuous.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.879
Your first test will be to stop the driftwood

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:35.348
before it falls into the river.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.049
Oh... Okay...

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.153
[screaming]

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.424
ELFIN: Ooops.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.026
Not so good at that one.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.695
The next test...

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.130
is all about speed.

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.531
Dodge these flowers.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.902
Flowers?

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:04.410
I give up!

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.545
ELFIN: Not so good on that one either.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.716
You tried you best Marucho.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.919
But it just wasn't good enough.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:15.354
So why don't you just give up?

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.490
[crying]

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.559
Guy tears. Gotta go.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:20.860
I won't give up.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:21.961
I'll never give up...

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.964
I'm a Bakugan Brawler and I'll save Preyas.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.632
Really...?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.569
[gasp] Trouble.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.038
ELFIN: Uh oh.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.511
There better be a few powerful Bakugans here.

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.516
MARUCHO: Stop it!

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.617
Stop it right now!

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.152
ELFIN: Give me back those Bakugan!

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.290
Yes...

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.727
MARUCHO: Don't touch that remote, Brawlers!

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.465
DAN: It's Bakugan Brawl time!

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.736
[Mylene chuckling]

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:04.870
Well, well, well.

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:06.472
What have we got here?

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:07.607
A human...

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.376
and a little Bakugan with a big mouth.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.312
Better than these small fry?

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.514
Leave them alone, you witch!

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.283
Those aren't warrior Bakugan!

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.251
[chuckles] You're right.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.987
They're weak.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.722
And useless.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.225
Did you see that?

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:27.994
She can't get away with this!

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.628
All talk, no action.

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:30.997
ELFIN: You want action?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.632
You got it!

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.000
We'll take you on!

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.436
You mean you changed your mind

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.838
about being partners, Elfin?

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:40.673
Well, sort of...

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:43.075
I mean, just this one time so we can teach

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.378
Miss Snarkypants a lesson...

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.513
A Bakugan Brawl with us

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:49.949
will wipe that smug smile off her face.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.084
You are good, right?

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.452
MARUCHO: Of course I am!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.720
Yeah, let's go!

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.389
Whoa, Marucho!

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:58.624
Um, don't you want to scan your partner's data first?

00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:00.226
Oh right, sorry.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.928
Scan Bakugan data.

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.901
These are all your stats, Elfin?

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.336
You're really amazing!

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.238
Oh, I'm not so impressive.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.639
[THINKING]: Intriguing.

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.575
I'll just have to take the Bakugan and find out more.

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.710
Ready!

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:19.845
Now you'll be sorry.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.181
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet activated.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.250
BOTH: Gauntlet... Power Strike!

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:28.020
Gate Card Set!

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.857
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.260
Bakugan Stand!

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.228
Aquos Abis Omega!

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.632
Don't worry little Bakugan.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:43.102
I'll make your defeat quick and painless.

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.403
Oh pleeease...

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.272
Ready to rock and roll Marucho?

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:50.109
You bet I'm ready, Elfin!

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:51.844
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.679
Bakugan Stand!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:12:00.686
Sun, Wind and Rain Combine!

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:07.226
Let Aquos Elfin Appear Marucho!

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.061
There's still time to run away!

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.199
Oh wow, Elfin...

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.934
You are so awesome!

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.635
Thanks, Cutie Pie!

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.571
Let's see how tough you are...

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.406
in a battle.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.174
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.310
Ability Activate!

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.146
Dry World!

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.215
It's just a little mist...

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:33.252
And mist can't hurt an Aquos Attribute Bakugan

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.087
You're not very smart, are you?

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.256
Watch it! That's not just mist!

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.326
ELFIN: The water's all gone!

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.727
MYLENE: With Dry World active,

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.863
you can't use your Aquos Abilities...

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:46.298
But Abis Omega can still use his!

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:47.766
It looks like your hopes for victory

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.902
just dried up little Bakugan.

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.105
[roar]

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.174
Yeow! Watch where you're going!

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.408
Seriously!

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.910
Elfin, watch out!

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:00.179
I am so done with this!

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:03.415
Attribute Change Ventus!

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.085
Sun, Wind and Rain Combine!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.690
Let Ventus Elfin Appear!

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.592
Nice try though!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.661
Now she's changed to Ventus...

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:18.564
Abis Omega's Dry World ability is useless!

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:21.233
So you're an Attribute Changing Bakugan!

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:22.835
I like variety.

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:24.003
Come on.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.371
Ability Activate!

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:26.572
Wing Mercury!

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:30.309
On wings of wind I strike!

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.651
Gotcha now!

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.726
That was incredible, Elfin!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.894
Easy peasy!

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.264
That's okay. I like a challenge.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:56.702
DAN: Still no sign of Marucho anywhere.

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:59.538
Like I said, he's a deserter.

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:00.906
I told you Ace...

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.841
Marucho is no coward!

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.610
Whoa! Look!

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:07.246
MIRA: That's... a Bakugan battle!

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:11.350
Attribute Change Darkus!

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:19.592
Let Darkus Elfin Appear so I can make you guys disappear!

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.660
GAUNTLET: Power Level even.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.796
So it's Darkus this time my friend...

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.231
Interesting...

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:28.167
You just might be worth keeping once you lose...

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.604
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.372
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.074
Aquos Clawser!

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:37.877
ELFIN: Combining Power Levels won't help you!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.712
This won't take long...

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:43.916
Ability Activate! Power Merge!

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.384
[groaning]

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.219
I'm losing energy!

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.521
MYLENE: Power Merge allows both Clawser and Stug

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.659
to steal 100 from your Power Level.

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:56.528
And so... you're mine!

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.264
MARUCHO: I don't think so!

00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.999
Ability Activate!

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.333
Go Twin Back!

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.502
[scream]

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:04.837
What do you know?

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.538
I feel like a new Bakugan!

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.842
Twin Back is an ability where any Power Level taken away

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.778
is returned times two!

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.847
[THINKING]: This human's not bad.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.415
Who'd have thought?

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:18.183
And I'm not finished yet...

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:19.685
Ability Activate!

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:21.253
Moon Rainbow!

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.893
A unique ability?

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:30.796
It decreases opponent's Power Levels by 200

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.265
and increases Elfin's by 200!

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.533
Taa daa!

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.335
And now for my next trick!

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:38.837
Nothing up my sleeve...

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.639
Now disappear!

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.947
You really took them out there, Elfin!

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.685
You can change attributes to Aquos, Ventus and Darkus...

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.987
But can you stand this?

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.555
Gate Card Set!

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:57.923
I don't get it...

00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:01.527
Her life meter is low but she's still confident...

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.462
What's that?

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:05.297
Trouble!

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.667
[thunder]

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.102
[chuckles]

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.938
I summon Trap Bakugan.

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:15.207
Aqua Tripod Theta!

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:25.884
[\u266a]

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.886
MYLENE: Tripod Theta is a powerful ancient Bakugan

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.388
long thought extinct.

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.657
But thanks to Vestel science we have revived him

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.359
as a Trap Bakugan.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.727
Twisted.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.362
Trap Bakugan?

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.997
We're not afraid of you!

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.833
Are we, Marucho?

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:41.967
Oh, right...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.402
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.537
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.774
Let Aquos Elfin appear...

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.409
Let's finish this!

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.681
MYLENE: Darkus Ability Activate.

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:58.550
Live Ripple!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.552
What is this, a ghost story?

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.154
They're not ghosts, Elfin...

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:04.490
They're probably energy bodies.

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.058
Energy bodies?

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:08.193
MYLENE: Tripod Theta also has the power of Aquos,

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:10.062
Ventus and Darkus.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:12.698
I have used its Darkus power to revive the energy bodies

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.666
of the Bakugan you've defeated.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.935
Is anyone else creeped out here?

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.404
Elfin, wait!

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.440
What happened?

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.909
MYLENE: Energy Bakugan feed Trap Bakugan's power.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:26.078
We can't win with a direct attack.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:27.179
Says you.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.881
I never lose, Marucho!

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:30.916
Hey Jumbo!

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:32.251
Let's dance!

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:33.752
Ability Activate!

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:35.387
Power Merge!

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.489
[screaming]

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.291
Elfin!

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:41.360
He's draining Elfin's power!

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.628
Got to stop it...

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:45.130
Maybe I can use Twin Back to reverse the flow!

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:46.665
Not so fast...

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:48.066
Ability Activate!

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.002
Octo Whip!

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.640
[screaming]

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.074
Marucho!

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:59.945
Now you are all mine, Elfin.

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:02.448
You will serve the Vexos.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.816
It is inevitable.

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:06.685
MARUCHO: Nooooo!

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.787
I'm okay? Who turned the water off?

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.922
It can't be!

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.690
You're supposed to be crushed!

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:15.027
MARUCHO: I.. I made it just in time, Elfin.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.462
M-Marucho!

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:20.632
You activated a defense ability when you should have run.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.167
You saved me!

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.469
MARUCHO: Delta Marine Snow...

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.838
Only Aquos Elfin can use it.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.239
I couldn't...

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.842
let them hurt you, Elfin.

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.711
Marucho! Wake up! You've got to be okay!

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:35.547
Risking his own life to save a silly Bakugan.

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:38.717
These humans are such imbeciles...

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.952
Take her.

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.020
You cannot continue without a Brawler.

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:44.389
Surrender to me now.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.327
Who threw that?

00:18:48.360 --> 00:19:00.973
[\u266a]

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.875
That light came from over here.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:11.450
[\u266a]

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.552
I'm getting tired of losing to you.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.354
You could be useful...

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:17.222
Why don't you join the Vexos?

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.060
No? Then farewell.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.403
Could that be...

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:32.771
my brother?

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.339
DAN: Marucho, are you okay?

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:37.376
Come on, talk to me buddy.

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:39.711
That you Dan?

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.647
Where am I?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.781
The battle!

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.049
The battle's over.

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.217
She's gone.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.287
Some Brawler took care of Mylene's Trap Bakugan.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.088
That's good because Elfin was in trouble.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:54.726
Oh no, Elfin!

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.029
Looks like I lost her too...

00:19:57.062 --> 00:20:01.700
[groaning]

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:04.436
Marucho, you're awake.

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:07.306
I brought you some water.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.308
Don't get-- Careful.

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.209
You're still here.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.511
Uh, yeeeah...

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.512
But why?

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.113
Why do you think?

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.248
You said...

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.549
I know what I said.

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.452
But you think I'd leave my goofy partner all alone?

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:22.154
Your partner?

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:25.157
Preyas always said the most important thing in Brawling

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.860
isn't speed or strength, it's caring about your partner.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.129
So I guess you passed the test.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.731
For now, anyway.

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.067
But only until the Bakugan are free again.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.168
Sure!

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.436
Way to go, Marucho.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.670
You found a partner!

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:42.608
BARON: That's so cool, Master Marucho!

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.309
MARUCHO: You won't regret this.

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.578
You and I will make an amazing team.

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.313
Once I get you in shape...

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:49.548
Start with push-ups.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.882
Drop and give me 50!

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.518
But you said power isn't important.

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.287
I have high standards.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.589
I want you looking good and feeling good!

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:59.157
Got it?

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.592
And don't think I'm going to let you off easy

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.061
like Preyas obviously did.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.230
You're going to be in tip-top shape!

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.267
DAN: Break time's over!

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:10.702
We've got a job to do.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:13.872
But before we can head out to Alpha City, New Vestroia

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:17.075
a mysterious stranger tries to mess with my head.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:22.180
Turns out it's Vexos Brawler Gus doing Spectra's dirty work.

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.983
And his Subterra Vulcan Bakugan

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.152
is the toughest I've ever seen!

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:30.522
Drago and I have a few surprises in store for him.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:33.091
I just hope they're enough to win.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.693
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.161
See you there!
