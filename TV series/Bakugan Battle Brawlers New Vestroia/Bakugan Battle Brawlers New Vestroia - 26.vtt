[\u266a]

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.189
[explosion]

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.326
[gasp]

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:21.360
Oh no!

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.564
This brawl's a blast!

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:25.598
Right Drago?

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.167
I will never be defeated.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.201
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:35.608
Daaaaaannnn!!

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.377
[\u266a]

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.547
[soft, crying]

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.150
...Mira!

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.184
Look!

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:48.521
It's Drago!

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.556
Awesome!

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:52.325
Way to go, Drago!

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.194
[\u266a]

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.763
Dan!!!

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:58.831
Whoa!

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.566
[happy laugh]

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.169
[relieved chuckle]

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:14.046
[\u266a]

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.015
Well done, Gus.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.651
[angry, desperate breathing] ...Noooo!

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:19.919
Warning.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.288
Gravitational Core will detonate in 10 seconds.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:26.559
[\u266a]

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:27.860
Nine.

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.895
Master Spectra, We must go.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.898
Eight. Seven... Six... Five... Four...

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.233
Get moving!

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.836
Three... Two... One...

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.404
Zero...

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:42.675
[explosion]

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:46.212
I will always remember that you came back for me.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:47.480
Master Spectra...

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.949
It pains me to inform you of this information...

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.551
but you must know Prince Hydron and the Vexos have

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.120
abandoned New Vestroia...

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:56.822
they intend to blame you for everything.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:00.459
That was something Mylene came up with Gus?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.627
That's right...

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.497
So now that Prince Hydron knows of our betrayal...

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.234
There's no way you and I can return Vestal again.

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:09.402
Who cares?

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:12.304
The truth is I never expected to return there anyway.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.575
[effort to breath]

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.612
D-Drago.... The next time we meet, only one of us

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:22.815
will survive.

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:30.623
[\u266a]

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.691
[playful laughter] Aaahhh!

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:35.761
Sweet freedom!

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.767
Now this is more like it!

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.836
Sure is...

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.772
I can't believe we pulled it off.

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.507
This is what we fought for Mira.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.576
Peace in New Vestroia.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.577
Yes...

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.281
but the battle's not over yet.

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:58.651
We have to go back home to Vestal.

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:01.720
But if everyone knows the Bakugan are intelligent

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:05.024
now, can't the Vestals stay?

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:08.461
Yes. As long as we all respect each other and abide by

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.030
the rules, the Bakugan and the Vestals can live

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.065
together in peace.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.366
Thank you, Drago.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.602
But I don't think it's as easy as all that.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:19.238
Prince Hydron and the Vexos may have gone back

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.973
but they won't be gone for long...

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:22.975
They'll want to take back New Vestroia.

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.044
That's why we're heading back to Vestal to spread

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.880
the word and stop the Vexos cold.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.582
We'll bring them to justice for enslaving the

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:31.851
Bakugan and taking the planet.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.720
But we can't do it without Wilda and the others.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:36.689
Can they come with us, Drago?

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:37.890
Of course.

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.558
If that is what they wish.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.627
I will go with you, Mira.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.928
Anywhere!

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:45.464
And someone has to keep Baron out of trouble.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:48.000
I'll go too, Drago.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.972
It has been an honour.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.341
The honour is mine.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:56.642
[amused chuckle]

00:12:56.675 --> 00:13:00.079
We never did settle the question of which of us is mightier.

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.881
Until we meet again, then.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:04.250
I'll be waiting, Percival...

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:09.922
Check it out.

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:12.725
Alpha City must be heading home...

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:15.294
So we should get going too.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.866
See you soon, Shun.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.134
Catch you later.

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.637
Master Marucho, I'm gonna miss you.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.539
Yeah, we're gonna miss you too.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.073
Same to you, Dan...

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.509
I will never forget brawling at your side.

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.111
Me too, Mira...

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:33.212
Good luck.

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:35.481
Say hi to Runo.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:39.084
[happy laughter]

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:47.927
[\u266a]

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.529
Looks like your ride's taking off.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:56.702
[\u266a]

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:00.739
Okay, time to go

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.208
Bye everyone.

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.609
Take care!

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.144
Master Dan!

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.947
Don't forget me!

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.114
Fly safe!

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:12.284
[happy laugh]

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.889
Does Vestal have e-mail?

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.791
[satisfied sigh] Well, that's that...

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:21.460
I guess it's time to make ourselves scarce too...

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:22.695
Hey Drago!

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.897
Can the Bakugan come back with us?

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.665
Of course they can!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:27.866
Yah!

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.135
That means Marucho and I can party on planet Earth!

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.203
As if!

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.705
Marucho and I are best buds! [cocky laugh]

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.106
That's old news.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.507
Marucho's outgrown you.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.042
You're jealous cause I'm Marucho's official

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.444
Bakugan partner.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.412
Look it up on Snickerpedia...

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.282
You're just a temporary substitute, Elfin. Got it?!

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:44.650
Huh?

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:46.218
That is so not true!

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.020
I'm Marucho's partner now...

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.154
so deal with it, fish breath, got it?

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.756
Why don't you deal with it, big ears!

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.791
I'm Marucho's partner now!

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.760
No, I'm Marucho's partner!

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:56.795
Hey! Come on you two...

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.764
Can't we all just get along?

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.734
You can both be my partner.

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.003
Runo was very worried about you.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:06.238
You should go to her Tigrerra

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:10.209
I am eager to see Julie.

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:13.078
I will go and see Alice.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.413
That's great.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:16.548
It looks like the whole gang is going back to Earth...

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.017
Right, Shun?

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:20.853
You're not coming, Skyress?

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.421
Oh Shun...

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.691
I am part of your past.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.394
Ingram is part of your future.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.296
Skyress.

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:34.433
You've grown so much, and I can't leave my home again...

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.969
Ingram, take care of my Shun.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:39.505
I will, Skyress.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:42.474
You'll be fine without me, Shun.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:45.744
I will always be watching over you in my heart...

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:49.381
But it's time to say goodbye and thank you!

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.850
Wait, Skyress!

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.285
Okay...

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:55.654
Almost all of us are going back then!

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.824
I guess you're right...

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.192
All right, Drago?

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:01.527
We're leaving...

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.562
Goodbye, buddy.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:06.298
Give my regards to Runo and the others.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.633
I don't understand.

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.768
Aren't you coming with us, Drago?

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.770
Drago can't come with us.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.072
What do you mean?

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.807
There's gotta be a way!

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.210
A part of my body is the Perfect Core, which keeps

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:20.245
New Vestroia stable.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:24.717
I'm afraid I can never leave New Vestroia again, Marucho...

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.154
That's not entirely correct, Drago.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.123
Apollonir?

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:36.595
[\u266a]

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:40.599
The Six Ancient Warrior Bakugan!

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:42.067
Drago.

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.737
A Bakugan evolves through battle.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.207
You have become even more strong than before.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.776
Strong enough to separate yourself from the Perfect

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.678
Core at last.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.912
Separate?

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.114
But how?

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:56.648
The Core would stay here and you would keep only a

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.084
spark with you to maintain your link.

00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:01.253
You have become nearly as powerful as the Perfect

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.355
Core itself, Drago.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:06.325
Powerful enough to do almost anything.

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:09.094
Then, I could go to Earth with Dan?

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.529
Yes, Drago.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:14.133
It would make no sense to keep you in New Vestroia.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:19.271
You have earned the right to live wherever you wish.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.906
Awesome!

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.875
Drago! We're going home!

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.810
You bet partner!

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:28.013
You can travel between words whenever you want.

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:30.682
You now have the power to open the Dimensional Gate

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.351
yourself, Drago.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.919
Really?

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.120
[amazed chuckle]

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:38.857
All right then, let's go home.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:48.000
[\u266a]

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:50.135
That is seriously cool, Drago!

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.703
Let's ride!

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:55.641
[happy laughter]

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.776
[\u266a]

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.378
Catch you later!

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.846
[leaping growl]

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.916
[contented growl]

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:05.717
Wait for me!

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:15.794
[\u266a]

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:24.036
[\u266a]

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.604
What was that?

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.006
[\u266a]

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.978
It's been too long, Alice.

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:36.448
Hydranoid?!

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.516
They did it...

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.885
Dan and the others saved you and New Vestroia!

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.186
They did.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.655
And they're back safe and sound.

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:47.593
They dropped me here so that I could see you again.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:51.363
[overjoyed laugh]

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.564
Welcome home...

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.966
Hydranoid!

00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:01.273
[\u266a]

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.941
No way...

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.343
Was that lightning?

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.611
Don't be silly.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:06.979
It's not raining.

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:09.615
Julie.

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:14.853
It's really me.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.088
I'm back!

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.122
Wow!

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.257
It's you Gorem!!!

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.760
Oh Gorem! Gorem! Gorem!

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:23.595
I have missed you so muuuuch!

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:26.131
[huge sobbing]

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.834
Aww, don't cry.

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:32.804
[\u266a]

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.140
Where is that Julie?

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.909
At least she's consistent.

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:38.310
She's never been on time...

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:41.547
[\u266a]

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.548
You're late.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.117
Finally decided to show up?

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.352
Hey... How's it going?

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.654
Dan!

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:49.855
What about New Vestroia?

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.156
And the Bakugan!

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:52.758
It's all been handled!

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.493
Piece of cake...

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.594
Of course!

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:56.962
Amazing!

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.497
Whoa!

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.885
Tigrerra!!!

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.620
[happy giggling] You're really here!

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:22.921
[laugh]

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.490
I was so worried about you!

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:28.727
I'm happy to see you too, Runo.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.162
What can I say?

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.964
Ladies love the Bakugan.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.365
Okay.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.501
Never speak of this again!

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.637
Shun! Marucho!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.006
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers are back together!

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.041
Good to see you, Runo.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.677
Hey! Runo, Gorem's back! Huh?

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:49.014
Okay, so everyone's back.

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.782
Well in that case...

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.952
Oh yeah!!!!!

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.555
Good to have the old team back together, Dan.

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:57.990
You got it. Friends forever...

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:00.359
Drago.

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.361
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.396
[happy laughter]

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:08.467
[\u266a]

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.469
We saved New Vestroia but King Zenoheld, leader of

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:13.372
the Vestals, wants serious payback.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.507
Luckily, our old friends have got our backs when

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.411
those goons launch their Bakugan Termination System!

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.947
But if the Six Ancient Bakugan Warriors aren't

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.183
powerful enough to stop King Zero-Head's attack,

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:26.518
what can we do?

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:29.388
It's a whole new battle, next time on Bakugan

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:32.591
Battle Brawlers: New Vestroia!

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.526
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.728
Have you got what it takes?

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:46.805
[\u266a]

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:56.448
