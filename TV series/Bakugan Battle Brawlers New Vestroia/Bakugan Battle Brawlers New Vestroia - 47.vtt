00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.774
PRINCE HYDRON: After the Brawlers destroyed the BT

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.944
System the bond between the Vexos started to crack.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.515
PRINCE HYDRON: It started with Volt, but I showed him.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.183
PRINCE HYDRON: He tried to drag me down with him, but

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.185
I wasn't going without a fight.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.856
PRINCE HYDRON: I mean it! Right now! Let go! Let go!

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.157
VOLT: [scream, pain]

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.358
PRINCE HYDRON: Unfortunately for Volt he had to learn

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.327
the hard way that disobedience and betrayal

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.928
get you a one way ticket to the furthest

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.430
reaches of the dimension.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.664
PRINCE HYDRON: No one turns their back on the

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.035
Vexos and gets away with it. No one!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.804
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.174
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.209
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.411
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.212
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.647
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.482
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.850
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.886
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.421
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.559
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.529
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.464
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:20.580
[\u266a]

COMPUTER VOICE: Rate of synchronization of each

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.051
segment has dropped from 50% to 48%.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.588
COMPUTER VOICE: Simulation Mode has been lost.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.923
PROFESSOR CLAY: Blast!

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.524
ZENOHELD: More problems, Clay?

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.928
Should I be looking for a replacement for you?

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.196
PROFESSOR CLAY: No problems, sir.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.698
We're very close to completion here...I beg of

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.366
you for a little more patience while we finalize

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.635
the analysis of the Battle Gear DNA.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.270
PRINCE HYDRON: Oh please... such a slowpoke.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.772
ZENOHELD: Enough stalling!

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.308
ZENOHELD: I want the Battle Brawlers destroyed!

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.278
PROFESSOR CLAY: [grunt] Yes, um, about the Brawlers sir...

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.813
ZENOHELD: Yes, what is it?

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.415
PROFESSOR CLAY: I have received intelligence that

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.684
says Spectra has joined forces with the Battle

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.452
Brawlers and that they have finished analyzing

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.055
the DNA code and the battle gear data.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.156
ZENOHELD: What's that?

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.424
PROFESSOR CLAY: If we had this information at our

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.125
disposal, it would allow me to complete the

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.962
Alternative in a much shorter time.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.964
ZENOHELD: I see. Mylene?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.165
MYLENE: Sire?

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.601
ZENOHELD: You! Are to go forth and retrieve this data

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.636
that Professor Clay is talking about.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.972
Return it to me or don't return at all.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.673
MYLENE: As you command, sir.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:25.778
[\u266a]

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.280
SHADOW PROVE: [chuckles]

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.916
LYNC: Hmmm.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.721
[\u266a]

DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Payback.

DAN: A toast! To Drago's new Battle Gear.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:44.430
ALL: Cheers!

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.670
DAN: I'm telling you Drago, that stuff is the coolest!

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.382
DAN: And we also owe...a really big thanks to Keith

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.450
DAN: And Marucho.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.425
WILLDA: Mira's so happy.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.261
NEMUS: Can you blame her? She finally has her brother back

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.864
and working along side of her.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.966
RUNO: Dinner's ready you guys!

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.101
JULIE: If you're hungry, come and get it!

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.705
DAN: Whoa! Best day ever!

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.809
ZENOHELD: It's time to make all those involved

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.711
with the destruction of the BT System pay for

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:32.912
their crimes...

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.447
ZENOHELD: ...with the lethal powers of Professor

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.983
Clay's Alternative Weapons System.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.251
MYLENE: Alternative?

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.352
ZENOHELD: When it's completed we will harness

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.554
enough power to destroy Vestal and Earth.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.289
ZENOHELD: We'll be able to annihilate every living

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.626
thing that dares to oppose us. We will be unstoppable!

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:54.934
LYNC: If we destroy..Earth...

00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:01.341
LYNC: I guess that ...that would mean...she's a goner.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.209
[grunt]

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.847
LYNC: Man!

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:18.925
[\u266a]

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.728
LYNC: [gasp] So this is the data for Clay's

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.397
precious Alternative System.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.874
[\u266a]

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.176
PROFESSOR CLAY: Can I help you?

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:40.947
LYNC: Are you really going through with creating this

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.782
Alternative thing?

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.317
PROFESSOR CLAY: Of course I am.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.556
LYNC: Even though it destroys entire worlds?

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.225
Don't you care about all the people you'll be

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.459
wiping out?

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.628
What about Mira and Keith?

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:58.631
LYNC: Level with me professor...

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.133
LYNC: You don't want to do this do you?

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.836
I mean what parent would put their kids in harm's way?

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.239
LYNC: You know, there is another option here.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:09.409
A way out that Zenoheld would never know about.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.110
You could build a self-destruct virus into

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.912
the System's software.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:17.850
PROFESSOR CLAY: Are you saying I should commit treason?

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.185
LYNC: I'm just saying you have a chance to do the

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:23.756
right thing....I know you want to.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.924
PROFESSOR CLAY: Let me give you a friendly piece

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.392
of advice, Lync.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.928
If the King even suspects that you'll betray him,

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.797
what happened to Volt will look like child's play

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.298
compared to your fate.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.668
LYNC: I'm kidding! Relax. [laughter]

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.637
Learn to take a joke, dude.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.978

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.113

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.517
You should be getting ready to go.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.720
We've been dispatched to fight the Brawlers.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.421
LYNC: You didn't hear the update?

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.424
I've been re-assigned to help Professor Clay with his work.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.492
MYLENE: What?

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.461
LYNC: Yeah, he needs help getting this Alternative

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.529
thing going and he specifically requested

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.998
me...How could I say 'no'?

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.537
MYLENE: Something stinks here.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.877
MYLENE: Excuse me, Professor Clay but I...

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.112
PROFESSOR CLAY: What?

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.613
PROFESSOR CLAY: Someone's made an unauthorized copy

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.315
of the Alternative data.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.016
MYLENE: What?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.418
PROFESSOR CLAY: Lync!

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.121
MYLENE: [gasp] Oh no!

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.092
LYNC: To Earth, Moscow!

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:40.199
MYLENE: [gasp]

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.135
You brat!

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.503
MYLENE: King Zenoheld!

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.438
Lync is heading to Earth and I believe he has a

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.573
copy of the Alternative Data with him.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.175
ZEONHELD What? Are you sure?

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:52.278
MYLENE: Positive. The transporter logs confirm it.

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.813
ZENOHELD: Hydron!

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.450
PRINCE HYDRON: Yes, Father.

00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:00.286
ZENOHELD: If the Brawlers...get their hands

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.788
on that data...

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.923
PRINCE HYDRON: Enough said.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.862

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:30.149
pretty...but also a good cook.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.985
I wonder if I surprised her...

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.221
LYNC: ...for sure, it would totally blow her

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:37.623
mind to see me.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.458
Okay, here goes.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:43.062
I hope she still isn't mad at me, for lying to her.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.363
Oh well... [gasp]

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.666
ALICE: You lied to me.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.702
LYNC: On second thought, maybe I shouldn't...I bet

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.871
she is still mad.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.239
PRINCE HYDRON: Well, well, well.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.074
Fancy seeing you here, Lync.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.943
PRINCE HYDRON: You get lost on your way to

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.010
Professor Clay's lab?

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.912
[\u266a]

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.747
LYNC: Yeah something...like that.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.552
PRINCE HYDRON: You've been a naughty boy, Lync!

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.324
LYNC: I won't let you hurt Alice, Hydron!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.728
PRINCE HYDRON: Lync...What were you thinking?

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.196
PRINCE HYDRON: I gave you a second chance after you

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.199
betrayed me and teamed up with, Spectra...but now

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:25.538
you've betrayed my father and that is unforgiveable...

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.274
Now hand over the Alternative data you stole.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:31.177
LYNC: Sorry. Don't know what you're talking about.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.511
PRINCE HYDRON: Your friend Volt made the mistake of

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.615
trying my patience you know.

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.817
LYNC: I'm serious. I don't know what you're talking about.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.552
PRINCE HYDRON: Well just to be safe I'll eradicate

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:42.521
any trace of the data, by eradicating you.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:43.556

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.226
PRINCE HYDRON: Oh, I see.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.896
You're acting like a fool because of that girl.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.512
is...making you disappear.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.580
LYNC: Whah? !

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:32.684
[\u266a]

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:45.531
LYNC: [exertion, struggling]

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.899
PRINCE HYDRON: Are you scared, Lync?

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.534
You should be.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:49.701
LYNC: [angry growl]

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.804
PRINCE HYDRON: [chuckles]

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.238
LYNC: [exertion]

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.940
LYNC: I'm sorry I wasn't able to make

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:57.476
things right between us.

00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:59.078
LYNC: [exertion]

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:01.180
PRINCE HYDRON: So long, Lync.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:05.150
[evil laughter]

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.288
LYNC: [exertion]

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:13.892
PRINCE HYDRON: Hmmph. [evil laughter]

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:20.399
[\u266a]

00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:25.771
ALICE: Delicious.

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:29.074
I need to find Grandfather so he can try some.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.245
ALICE: [gasp]

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.047
ALICE: What happened here?

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.617
ALICE: [gasp]

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:48.594
ALICE: What's this? [gasp]

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:53.131
ALICE: A memory card?

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.833
PRINCE HYDRON: The traitor Lync and his stolen copy

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:57.603
of the Alternative data have been disposed of.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:59.238
Neither will cause us any more trouble.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.140
ZENOHELD: I see.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:03.375
ZENOHELD: Is that all?

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:04.676
PRINCE HYDRON: Huh?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.878
ZENOHELD: What do you want?

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.479
A pat on the head?

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.214
Can't you see I'm busy here?

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.850
Get out of my sight and quit disturbing me.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.218
HYDRON: [frustrated grunt under his breath]

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:21.360
DR. MICHAEL: Hmm? Alice?

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.395
Where exactly did you find this data?

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.964
ALICE: Hmmm. Why? What's wrong?

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.333
DR. MICHAEL: This is Vestal technology.

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.701
ALICE: [gasp]

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.503
That must mean that the destruction outside was

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.405
caused by a battle.

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.840
And this glove...

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:36.475
ALICE: ...must've belonged to...

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.044
DR. MICHAEL: Alice!

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:40.045
DR. MICHAEL: We have to contact Dan and the others

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.113
immediately.

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:42.281
They need to see this.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.782
ALICE: Yes, of course.

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:44.950
KEITH: This is the raw data and blueprints for

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:47.219
Professor Clay's 'Alternative.'

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:50.522
DAN: Alternative? What's that Keith?

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.291
KEITH: It's a lethal weapon that can destroy

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.394
entire galaxies and the lives within.

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:56.662
DRAGO: You're kidding.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:59.031
DAN: They must be making this thing right now.

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.532
BARON/ACE: [gasp]

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.167
MIRA: Father.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.236
KEITH: How did you get this?

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.841
ALICE: Lync, left it behind for me to find.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.143
KEITH: Lync?

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:15.147
ALICE: Yes, but I don't think he's...

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.348
KEITH: I see.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.317
MARUCHO: This data suggests that it's unfinished...

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.086
MARUCHO: ...but they are definitely well on their way.

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.487
KEITH: [gasp]

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:23.655
RUNO: So then.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.157
JULIE: We're still safe!

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.391
KEITH: Not for long.

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:27.659
RUNO/JULIE: Huh?

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:28.961
KEITH: It looks like in order to finish the

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:30.062
'Alternative'...

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:32.564
KEITH: ... they need the DNA code and battle gear

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:36.368
data that we have in our possession.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:38.203
DAN: That means the Vexos will be coming for it, and

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.471
probably soon!

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:40.606
Is that right?

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.608
KEITH: That's correct.

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:45.077
DAN: Then we'll be waiting for them.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.545
RUNO: Dan...

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.414
DAN: These guys just never learn, but we're ready.

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:51.483
What do you say, Drago?

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:52.751
DRAGO: I'm ready.

00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:54.386
MARUCHO: We're all ready, Dan.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.489
ACE: Yeah, with a knuckle sandwich!

00:20:57.522 --> 00:21:00.525
KEITH: Losing is absolutely not an option, Dan.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:03.795
DAN: Trust me, Keith. It never has been.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.001
MYLENE: Shadow Prove and I were dispatched by King

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.303
Zenoheld to retrieve the Brawlers Battle Gear data.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:13.005
We infiltrated their secret base but were

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.240
surprised when we were confronted by Spectra.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.708
MYLENE: I don't see what the big fuss is.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.410
He's even less impressive in person.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.978
But now that he's a member of the Brawlers I have

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.481
even more of a reason to want to take him down.

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.416
And that's exactly what I plan on doing.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.918
Finally! A chance to battle Spectra!

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.186
MYLENE: You'll need a ringside seat to catch all

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.554
the action in this one!

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:30.989
MYLENE: Let's go Macubass!

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:33.792
MYLENE: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.093
MYLENE: Hold on tight!

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:46.772
