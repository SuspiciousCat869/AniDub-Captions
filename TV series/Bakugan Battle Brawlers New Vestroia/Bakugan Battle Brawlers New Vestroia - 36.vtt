00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.509
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.578
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.414
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.350
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.519
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.921
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.256
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.126
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.395
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.764
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.532
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.900
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.602
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:45.678

SAMURAI PARK STAFF: Welcome!

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.770
Thanks for coming and don't forget that tomorrow

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.273
is the grand opening of our newest attraction

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.975
Samurai Park, where you can experience ancient

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.644
Japan first hand!

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.479
VOLT: Humph...where are you Brawlers?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.719
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Samurai Showdown.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.891
DAN: Okay, Ace...I'm taking you down this hand.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.626
ACE: Hey I dunno, Dan.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.328
I've been watching the cards and I think you're

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.465
holding the last one I need to take it.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.333
ACE: Let's see. Am I right?

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.534
DAN: [growl]

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.870
DAN: [scream] But I was so close!

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.104
ACE: Hmmm.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:48.441
BARON: Whoa. Master Dan sure takes his cards seriously.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.576
DAN: Man, I haaaaaate losing.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.710
RUNO: Dan has a lousy poker face.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.246
JULIE: Maybe, but his regular face sure is cute.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.882
DAN: Ahhhh, this game is kinda dumb anyway.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.551
The only cards that matter to me are Ability Cards.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.522
DRAGO: I must admit. Even I am craving a good brawl.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.557
ACE: Dan...we're all going crazy, but let's keep

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.792
it in check.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.193
MARUCHO: Ace is right, Dan.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.528
Look what happened to Mira and Runo when they went

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.696
out to brawl.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.431
[beeping]

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.832
Huh?

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.502
KLAUS: Well... Good morning fellow brawlers.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.837
DAN: Klaus?

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.408
KATO: Huh?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.580
MARON: Mmmm... Is Baron here?

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.350
KATO: And who are you?

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:32.886
KLAUS: So... how are things since your return to Earth?

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.220
MARUCHO: Not great.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.589
MIRA: The Vexos took the Subterra and Aquos

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.857
Energies from us.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.692
KLAUS: Are you serious?

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.860
DAN: Don't worry, pal.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.129
They won't be taking any more from us...How are you

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.697
holding up on Vestal?

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.666
KLAUS: There's been no trace of them here since

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.834
your departure.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.536
So it would seem our theory about them luring

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.971
you away from Vestal was correct.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.007
Please be careful everyone.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.542
DAN: Safety's the rule, dude...

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.777
we aren't taking anymore chances with the remaining

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.480
energies....right...Drago?

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.115
DRAGO: You better believe it.

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.984
KLAUS: Oh, before I forget. Baron, my boy.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.854
BARON: Uh, yeah?

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:09.422
KLAUS: Your little sister came around to my place

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.158
looking for you after you left....She should be

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.093
paying you a visit shortly.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:15.395
BARON: Greeeaaat!

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:19.065
It'll be nice to - uhhh...what?

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.067
NEMUS: Maron's coming here to Earth?

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.138
KATO: A visitor...has arrived, Master Marucho.

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.606
MARON: Big brother!

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.807
MARON: [excited squeal]

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.142
BARON: Maron. What's wrong?

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.743
MARON: Nothing. I just really missed you Baron so I thought...

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.979
I'd come here.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.382
BARON: Maron, this place isn't safe for little kids like you.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.684
MARON: [gasp]

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.218
MARON: Are you mad at me?

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.721
BARON: I'm really sorry about all this...I left my

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:45.358
family Klaus' contact info in case of an emergency

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.527
but I didn't think this would happen.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.828
DAN: No sweat, big guy.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.863
DRAGO: Maron misses her big brother.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.532
You can't blame her for that.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.701
RUNO: You know, Baron...Since your little

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.135
sis' came all this way, it's only polite that you

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.370
show her around town.

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.305
JULIE: This is her first visit to Earth after all.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.773
BARON: Uh...yeah but...

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.308
NEMUS Maybe they're right Baron.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.677
What harm could a little sight seeing do?

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:05.845
BARON: [sigh]

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.380
MARON: I can go home.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.048
BARON: Are you kidding me?

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.783
We're going to have the best day ever Maron!

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.353
MARON: [delighted squeal]

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.821
SCREAMING PEOPLE: [excited/terrified screams]

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:15.989
BARON: So what d'ya think?

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.392
There isn't anything quite like this on Vestal, huh?

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.867
MARON: This place is wonderful, Baron.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.569
BARON: I thought the same thing the first time Dan

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.803
brought me here.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.238
MARON: Hey, look at that!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.439
BARON: Maron, wait!

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.644
NEMUS: Maron sure moves fast, doesn't she?

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.113
BARON: Huh? What's this?

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.148
MARON: [delighted squeal] Thank-you so much bear.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.717
BARON: ...The Grand Opening of Samurai Park.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.320
MARON: Samurai Park. What's that?

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.455
BARON: Mmmmm. Our next stop!

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.090
MARON: Mmmhmmm.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.497
INGRAM: Are you sure about this, Shun?

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.233
Maybe we should tell the others.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.834
SHUN: Telling them will just make them worry and

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.871
they're stressed enough as it is...This is something

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:09.042
that I need to do, Ingram...I can't hide out any longer.

MARON: Are you sure it's open, Baron?

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.485
NEMUS: It definitely looks closed to me.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.722
BARON: Mmmmm...Whaaaat? I got the date wrong.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.058
It says here it doesn't open until tomorrow.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.093
MARON: So we can't go in, then?

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:30.163
BARON: Sorry Maron...How 'bout we go back to the other

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:34.434
park and go on the roller coaster...til we throw up.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.703

visit us again soon, little Maron?

I was just talking about the rollercoaster.

Yeah, that's it.

JULIE: So Ace and I have been hanging out a lot and

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.036
were becoming pretty good friends.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:13.372
But then Billy showed up like a blast from the past

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.940
and brought Lync and Mylene.

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.142
But I was too excited about Billy to notice.

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.677
JULIE: Meanwhile Ace and the others were having

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.446
special Bakugan Battles in a virtual training world

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.848
that Marucho created.

They said it wasn't real but some of those hits

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.684
looked painful.

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:26.685
Y'owch!

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.086
JULIE: Real or not.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.622
It's serious business that has to be seen to be believed.
