WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.541
It had been six whole months since we freed New

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:11.911
Vestroia from the Vestal lnvaders and the Vexos.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.147
We were all back on Earth taking some much needed

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.483
chill out time with our Bakugan.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.452
Life was realllly sweet.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.121
So much time had passed that the troubles on

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.958
New Vestroia seemed like a distant memory...

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.194
...that is, until familiar face from past showed up.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.295
Who's that?

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.097
I dunno. It kinda looks like...

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.832
Mira!

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.967
Hey stranger.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.101
Miss me?

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:45.178
[\u266a]

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:54.821
[\u266a]

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.446
King Zenoheld, I have a status report for you.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.916
The Bakugan Terminator System is finally complete.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.918
Our preliminary tests indicate that it is fully

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.187
functional and ready to go online.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.122
Once activated, the BT System will destroy any

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.259
Bakugan caught within a six-thousand kilometer radius.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.962
The only thing left to do is to gather Pyrus,

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:41.234
Subterra, Haos, Darkus, Aquos and Ventus.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.002
The six superpower attribute energies needed

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.438
to charge the system.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.640
It sounds like things are right on schedule.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.509
Continue with your work.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.044
As you wish, sir.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.449
They may have forced me to leave Vestal,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.952
but with the BT System, I'll have vengeance

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.222
against the Bakugan who disgraced me.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.923
[\u266a]

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.661
[\u266a]

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.563
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.131
\"Six Degrees of Destruction\".

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.636
[\u266a]

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.771
Runo, Julie, you look great.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.140
Aw thanks, Mira.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.374
You look great too.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.575
Did you do something with your hair?

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.610
You noticed!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.479
Actually, I'm hoping Dan notices too.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.615
Um...I'm sure he will.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.949
What's with all the whispering.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.286
Hey Mira, what's up with Baron and Ace?

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.054
How are they doing?

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.524
Oh, you know, settling back in to normal life.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.492
Now that the Bakugan are free they must have a lot

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.127
of spare time like us.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.462
Baron is busy helping out with his brothers and

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.830
sisters at home.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.332
Ace, I haven't heard from in a while.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.301
Elfin, what a lovely surprise.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.369
Wilda, long time no speak...

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.703
Whoa!

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.771
Hi there Willda.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.239
My name's Preyas. Pleased to meet you.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.641
I hear I have you to thank for taking care of my

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.142
little Elfin here.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.178
What do you mean by \" your little Elfin\"?

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.714
I'm not your little anything!

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.150
Don't you know it's rude to interrupt people when

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.785
they're talking?

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:06.886
Now, where were we?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.388
Me rude?

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.124
I'm not the one invading people's personal space!

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:12.125
Space?

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.226
I'll knock you into outer space?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.561
Hey guys. Break it up.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.828
He/She started it!

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.063
Greetings, Wilda.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.298
I am Tigrerra.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.733
Thank you for rescuing me after I was captured by

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.068
the Vexos.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.937
I will return the favor.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.238
I am Gorem.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.773
We've heard so much about you.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.508
It's an honor to meet you.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.776
Please, the honor is mine.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.011
I'm very happy to be here.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.179
So Mira...

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.048
...Tell us what's been happening in Vestal since

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.550
we parted ways back in New Vestroia?

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.485
Yeah, I've been dying to know what happened to that

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.555
creep Prince Hydron and his Vexos goons.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.457
Wow, where do I start?

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.226
As soon as we returned to Vestal we were invited to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.129
go on the evening news in order to tell our story.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.732
While we were gone, several rumors had been circulating

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.702
about what was really happening in New Vestroia.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.070
We went in front of the cameras live,

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.539
to tell the people of Vestal the truth.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.541
Citizens, we are the Bakugan Resistance and

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.477
we're here to tell you that you've been lied to.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.479
King Zenoheld and Prince Hydron wanted you to

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.881
believe that we traveled to New Vestroia to settle

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.184
there, when in fact their true intention was to

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.619
conquer that world.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.887
An army of thugs known as the Vexos were dispatched

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.090
to capture the Bakugan inhabitants of New

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.759
Vestroia, after which they were brainwashed and

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:23.529
forced to do battle in the arenas for sport.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.798
These battles were used to distract the public from

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.700
learning Zenoheld's true motives.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.203
But perhaps the biggest lie told was that the

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.206
Bakugan were brainless, savage beasts.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.008
The Bakugan are not monsters.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.243
They are intelligent, sensitive beings like us.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.978
What Mira says is true.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.980
Bakugan and Vestals are alike and we wish to live

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.282
together in peace.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.583
Did those Bakugan just speak?

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.885
I think they did, but how can that be?

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.921
Of course the Royal Family immediately denied everything.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.523
They said the talking Bakugan was some kind of

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.458
Television trick done with sound effects.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.428
CROWD: \"Free the Bakugan!\"

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.929
\"Shame on Zenoheld for lying to his people!\"

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.564
\"Down with the Royal Family!\"

00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.732
Luckily for us, the people believed that we were the

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.034
ones telling the truth.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.603
And they all banded together to rise up and fight.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.371
So then...

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.740
...what happened to King Zenoheld and Prince Hydron?

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:10.843
They disappeared one night under the cover of darkness.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.645
You mean someone kidnapped them?

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.714
No, they fled before they could be captured and held

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.417
accountable for their crimes.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.719
King Zenoheld, Prince Hydron and the Vexos all

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.354
escaped inside the Royal Palace.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.156
Before anyone realized what was happening,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.058
it was too late to stop them.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.027
I can't believe King Zenoheld is such a chicken.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.029
King Zenoheld is no coward.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.798
He wasn't running away to hide out in some dark

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.332
corner of the galaxy.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.335
Just after his escape the resistance learned that he

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.704
was preparing to hatch an even bigger plan.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.872
That would make him the ruler of everything and everyone.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.007
But that's crazy.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.742
There's no way we can sit by and let that happen.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.911
But how are we supposed to stop him if we don't even

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.612
know where he is.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.880
He could be anywhere.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:51.884
Well, we aren't 100% certain that it's true.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.886
It would be a difficult task to accomplish even

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.088
for Zenoheld.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.757
Let's hope for our sakes it's just a rumor.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.325
Excuse me ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.127
I'd like to thank you for your patience and let you

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.196
know that we'll be preparing to land shortly.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.168
Wow, Earth is so beautiful from up here.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.306
Marucho and his family have this entire place to themselves?

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.841
You think this is impressive.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.609
Wait 'til you see the inside.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:19.245
In honor of Mira's visit, it seemed only natural

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.613
that we celebrate.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.882
I've had a little snack prepared for us in the ballroom.

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:25.284
I wasn't sure what you liked so my chef prepared everything.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.385
[Giddy and excited and banter]

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.287
Thanks Marucho.

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:34.127
[Giddy and excited and banter]

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:47.840
Um...guys...did you just see...Hey, wait up!

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:55.314
[\u266a]

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.716
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.518
You're not dreaming.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.553
Everyone has this reaction the first time.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.022
Can you blame them?

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.657
Is this the ballroom, Marucho?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.691
Oh, my goodness.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.694
It's absolutely gorgeous.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.296
You're hilarious, Mira.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:11.931
How many ballrooms would have a toilet in the

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.267
center of the room?

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.805
This is the bathroom, silly.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.107
The ballroom is this way.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.784
Wow, this all looks so fabulous.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.085
Take it easy, Julie.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.320
Where are your manners?

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:35.321
This is Mira's party.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.756
Oh right. Sorry.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.825
To friendship!

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.626
Welcome back Mira.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.761
Thank-you guys.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.162
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.163
Julie, Runo.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:47.133
I brought gifts for you.

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.235
Here.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.970
Are those what I think they are?

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.639
Wow. Gauntlets!

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.441
Awesome. Can you say coolest ?

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:57.276
Thank-you, Mira.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.979
[\u266a]

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.247
Based on the information gathered by our

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.916
technicians we've calculated what we believe

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.451
to be the six correct frequencies to reach the

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:08.054
intended targets.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:11.357
Hmmm. You had better hope that this works.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.726
Attention! Begin transmission.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.828
Beginning transmission, sir.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:22.401
[\u266a]

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.937
Are you receiving the same message that I am?

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.139
It would appear that King Zenoheld is challenging us

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.474
to a battle.

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:29.809
I hear it too.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.077
He is demanding that we surrender our six

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.912
attribute energies to him.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.081
He is also saying that if we refuse,

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:38.484
he will destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.152
Hmmph. Surely he is mad.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.154
I say we ignore him.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.858
But Clayf, what if his threat is real.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.862
It's possible that he is lying and that this is

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.364
some kind of a trap.

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.633
But still, we cannot let a threat against the lives

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.168
of the Bakugan go unanswered.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.319
The Six Ancient Warriors are about to throw down old school.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:14.387
Don't miss it.

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.556
Always keep your eye on your enemy and your head

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.591
in the battle. Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.328
Ah, the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.996
You've accepted my invitation.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.165
I was worried that perhaps you wouldn't show and that

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:28.968
I'd be forced to come and find you.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.071
[laughs]

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:35.041
You are sadly mistaken, my foolish man.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.410
We are not agreeing to your invitation.

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.546
We came only to address the threat that you made

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:42.848
against the Bakugan.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.420
Once activated, the BT System will destroy any

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.756
Bakugan caught within a six-thousand kilometer radius.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:55.428
The only thing left to do is to gather Pyrus,

00:09:55.461 --> 00:10:00.399
Subterra, Haos, Darkus, Aquos and Ventus.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.435
The six superpower attribute energies needed

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.870
to charge the system.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.775
This BT System of yours.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:12.311
The one you designed to destroy Bakugan.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.246
Why we would ever allow you to have our six

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.483
attribute energies to power such a device?

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.885
Well, I must confess I knew,

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.154
I knew you wouldn't give them up without a fight.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.523
Luckily for me I have never been one to shy away

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:25.758
from battle.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.027
No matter who my opponents may be.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.130
Luckily for you , I am also a reasonable man, and

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.200
because of that I am offering you this one last chance

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:38.037
to surrender your attribute energies to me peacefully.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.039
Do you really believe that you are strong enough to

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.475
take on the six of us on by yourself?

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.776
I have no doubt.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.378
Gauntlet activated.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.279
Gauntlet, Power Strike.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.281
You may think that as Ancients you have the

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.718
advantage over me, but I will show you that you are wrong.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.720
And that nothing can match the strength,

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.423
stealth and speed of Vestal technology.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:11:00.459

Farbros has been deployed, sir.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.579
Systems check shows everything in working order, sir.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.448
After studying all of the data collected from each

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.984
of the Bakugan we threw in New Vestroia,

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:28.754
we have finally created the ultimate weapon.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:31.657
The mechanical, Farbros.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.060
It is a name that will be known and feared

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.661
throughout the realms.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.797
I'll remind everyone that if we lose this...

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.266
...it means not only the loss of our attribute

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.869
energies but also the extinction of the Bakugan race.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.171
Then losing isn't an option.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.305
Is it?

King Zenoheld, Farbros' Battle Balance Program

hasn't finished yet, so his response time will

only be functioning at approximately 90%.

I feel strange too.

It is the Six Ancient Warriors.

Drago, you and your friends must listen carefully.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:32.337
We were defeated in battle by King Zenoheld.

You fought Zenoheld?

What he desired from us...

...was to take our Six Attribute Energies.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.878
He needed them to power the Bakugan Termination

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:42.714
System, a device he created to destroy all

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.882
Bakugan.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:45.751
To keep them free from Zenoheld's clutches,

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:48.987
we are entrusting you with our Six Attribute Energies.

It's like they've all...evolved.

Remember Brawlers, you and your Bakugan are our last

hope against Zenoheld.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:30.295
Only you can stop him and his weapon of mass Bakugan

Oh man. I feel like I got hit by a truck.

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:42.474
All of you fell to the floor suddenly and were unconscious.

That was no dream.

Drago's right.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.691
It was all real.

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:00.959
It's not a rumor.

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.494
That stuff about King Zenoheld is true.

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.863
And it's up to us to put an end to his plan!

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.335
Hey, Baron here.

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:12.504
After talking to Ace, I've decided to get my own place.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:15.774
Our house is just too small for me and my family.

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.409
I know my brothers and sisters will be sad to see

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:20.579

Is that Prince Hydron?

Man I'd like to smoke that turkey.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.684
I'll have to be careful though.

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:28.754
He's a fierce brawler and I don't want Nemus to get burned.

Don't miss what happens next!
