WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.275
Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.077
King Zenoheld came out of hiding,

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.147
and brought with him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.183
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.052
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.654
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.823
But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and transferred

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.759
their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.028
Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.463
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.565
The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands and the

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.633
stakes are high.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.235
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:45.311
[\u266a]

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:54.954
[\u266a]

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.071
Vestal is entering an age of unheralded prosperity

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.238
and growth.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.907
With the population booming and land quickly

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.342
running out, a solution was needed and that

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.179
solution is: Aero-Aqua Estates.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.015
Using patented technology, Klaus Industries builds

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.516
you the home of your dreams,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.319
floating high in the sky, yet still surrounded by nature.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.221
Those Aqua Apartments...Looks like

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.156
pretty sweet living to me.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.026
I didn't realize you were looking for a new place to live.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.761
I thought you liked our place.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.263
No, not for me. For Baron.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.705
Master Klaus?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.173
Yes, what is it?

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.142
I thought you'd like to know that there is an

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:52.612
interesting customer in our showroom down below.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.913
Oh really?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.381
That is very interesting...That looks

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:59.419
like Ace Grit, a former member of the Resistance.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.720
Hmmm.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.627
Bakugan Brawlers in \"Saved by the Siren\".

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.930
Using state of the art architecture,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.299
our Aqua Apartments offer the top of the line style

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.168
and function with stunning views of the

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.137
surrounding landscape from every room of your unit.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.639
Whoa...

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.074
Even our submerged units provide you with...

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.143
an underwater view of the lake that surrounds the building.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.079
Can we live there, please?

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:33.353
Bah...There's no way Baron can afford that ...Come on.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.654
Let's go eat.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.788
Excuse me, sir?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.923
Huh?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.759
I couldn't help but over hear your conversation.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.528
We have a new development priced for our more budget

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.463
conscious customers.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.732
Why don't you go have a look at the building site.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.568
Uhhhh.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.736
I'm starving.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.937
How bout I fix us some lunch?

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.171
I could make...whoa!

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.373
That's weird.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.541
What's wrong, Dan?

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.409
Nobody's supposed to be home and the door's open.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.478
Maybe your Mom forgot to lock the door behind her

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.946
when she left for yoga.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.015
Or maybe someone else is inside.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.116
Who else could it be?

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.784
A burglar?

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.286
In the middle of the afternoon?

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.520
It couldn't be...Could it?

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:15.995
[Scream]

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.331
[Screams, grunts as they land]

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.632
Hey buddy, what's the big idea?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.368
I'm gonna call the... Uh? Dad?

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:23.603
What are you doing here?

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.471
Well, I live here don't I?

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.206
Can a man not come home to his own house to surprise

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.108
his wife for lunch?

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.377
Umm...today's Wednesday, Dad...

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.080
Mom always goes to yoga then lunch with her friends.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:36.049
Good thing it was us you surprised and not her.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.150
'Cause she might have bonked you on the head

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.451
with a frying pan.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.587
Well, it was nice to see you guys...but I should be

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.088
get going.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.058
Hang on a sec ...This is for you...you're not the

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.194
only one full of surprises today.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.463
What's this?

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.367
Vanilla pudding!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.402
I picked some up for you at Runo's restaurant

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.972
earlier...I know it's your favourite.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.507
How did I get so lucky [sniff] to have a son as

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.443
nice and thoughtful as you...?

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:08.915
[affectionate ad-lib. \"Are you my big guy?\" etc...]

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.217
Seriously Dad, it's just pudding!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.952
Having family is nice.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.754
It sure is.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.789
I really miss my brother, Keith.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.292
I hope he's okay wherever he is.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.296
It looks like this is the spot in the brochure.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.131
They're putting aqua apartments here?

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.067
I have to admit, it is a nice area...and it is

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.769
close to Baron's parents' house.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:30.903
He'll like that.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.406
He has such a nice family. I bet you're envious.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.641
What?

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.842
Wouldn't you like to have a bunch of little brothers

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.443
and sisters running around? Huh?

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.379
And fight for my turn all the time?

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.648
Huh.. Why would I want that?

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.750
...Forget it. I love being on my own.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.685
If you say so.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.654
Actually, the more I think about it,

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:48.888
we should all get apartments in this

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.991
building...this would be a perfect location for the

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:55.161
Battle Brawlers to set up their secret base.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.396
Secret base?

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.564
Yeah...we need to be ready in case Zenoheld and his

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.501
Vexos goons decide to attack again.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.110
We heard the alarm.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.178
What's going on?

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.313
Captain?

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.681
The Vexos and their Mechanical Bakugan have

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.482
entered Area X02.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.684
Go!

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.552
Aye Captain!

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:23.022
[laughs] That would be so sweet.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.891
You're such a dreamer, Ace.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.027
Well, let's call Baron to see what he thinks.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.028
Hey Baron -

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.997
Ace! Where are you?

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.499
Baron, I'm just around the corner. I was -

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.734
- They're here!

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:35.935
The Vexos are back!

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.337
No way!

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.238
Prince Hydron and his Mechanical Bakugan

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.773
attacked us in the park...

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:41.874
And then...

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:45.078
And now it's time for me to take...your Haos Energy

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.981
They've got the Haos Energy,

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.417
I bet Percival's Darkus Energy next.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.618
We'll see about that.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.287
You've done well winning your first battle and bringing

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.657
back the Haos Energy but we must not lose momentum.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.859
We need to strike against the Battle Brawlers while

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.160
they're still weak.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.261
Don't worry father.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.996
The next attack is already in motion.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.866
Mylene should arrive on Vestal any minute now.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.534
Mylene?

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.204
[Laughs] She's jealous I was the first to score a

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.606
victory so she's off to prove herself...so we'll

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.276
see if she's as tough a Brawler as she claims to be.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.285
That spoiled brat, Hydron.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.820
Just who does he think he is?

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:31.758
He's isn't the only one with mighty Brawling skills.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.493
Is that who I think it is?

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:34.694
Is that Mylene?

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.795
Oh no.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.731
Does this mean the Vexos are coming back?

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.504
I see you Ace.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.573
I'm on my way to you now!

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.009
...Just keep your eyes peeled and be careful!

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.244
You got it, pal.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.845
So, it's starting again.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.347
What are we going to do, Ace?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.982
For now, we wait for Baron.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:57.950
But we've also got to warn Dan and Mira.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.118
But they're on Earth.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.219
How will we get to them?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.288
Listen Mr. Questions...quit

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.290
yakking and let me figure this out.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:05.792
Lovers' quarrel?

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.294
How cute.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.232
Mylene?

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.635
Baron told me what Hydron did to him.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:18.070
Then you know why I'm here...Make things easy

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:21.140
for yourself and hand over the Darkus Energy now.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.009
You want me to just give up?

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.511
Where's the fun in that...? Let's dance.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.579
Hah!

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.880
As you wish.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.182
Well, well, well.

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:30.516
The surprises keep on coming,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.952
Sirenoid...It seems that you and I have a front row

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.954
seat to a Bakugan Battle.

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:38.658
What do you propose we do, Master Klaus?

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.726
Well, I'm not much of a spectator.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.166
Gauntlet, power strike! [Grunting]

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:56.042
Gate Card, set!

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.845
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:06.586
[\u266a]

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:10.656
I am Darkus Midnight Percival!

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:16.462
I see he's evolved...Big deal...Evolved or not,

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.097
he's still no match for what I've got.

[\u266a]

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.681
A Mechanical Bakugan?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.451
Time to show this boy who's boss.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.790
Percival! Let's kick that bucket of bolts to the curb!

[\u266a]

Cheap magic tricks...How dull.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:20.760
Maybe this will excite you...Ability, activate.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:22.862
Stray thunder!

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.096
[\u266a]

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.798
Huuuaaaahhhh!

[\u266a]

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.304
I see you like sneak attacks.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.139
It figures...cowards.

[\u266a]

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.753
Did you really think Percival was any kind of

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.455
match for Macubass?

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.890
You haven't beaten us yet.

Haaaaaaahhhhhhh

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:05.571
Huh...Interesting...Ability, activate.

Ability Card, set.

[\u266a]

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.551
[grunting]

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:19.652
Alright...

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.887
This tin can really does pack a punch.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.222
Ready for more?

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.724
Ability, activate!

[\u266a]

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:39.438
You're all bark and no bite, Mylene...Gate Card, open!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.376
Changeling force!

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:49.515
[\u266a]

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:50.616
What the...?!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.118
Oh, did you like that one?

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.819
Changeling Force is a Command Card that reverses

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:56.155
your opponent's ability effect.

00:10:56.188 --> 00:11:04.997
[\u266a]

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.199
You think you're such a tough guy...do your

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:10.369
Brawling skills match your mighty ego?

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.271
[\u266a]

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.340
I call Macubass!

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:18.110
You always do things the hard way.

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:22.114

Repeating abilities?

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.121
You bore me!

Ability activate!

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.259

Improving on a classic...Fusion Ability Activate!

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.766
Vermillion!

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.670
Any last words, Vexos scum?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.838
[Roar]

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.540
You make me laugh...Gate Card,

[\u266a]

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.452
[Grunt, exertion]

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.953
Enough with the fun and games.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.588
Time to get down to business.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.190

[grunt, pain]

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:19.105
What was that?

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.475
[Grunt, pain]

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.578

Bind Shield!

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.052
Hmmmph.

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.754
A shield won't help if you leave your backside exposed.

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:38.023
[grunt, pain]

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.758
Those little guys are a pain in the butt.

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.261
Literally...How does she get them to move so fast?

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:45.297
I'm using the Automatic Brain Scan Image Direction System.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.734
Or ABSIDS for short...It's a computerized weapon it

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.103
scans brainwaves then relays information to the

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:54.940
attack pods who carry out maneuvers based on my thoughts.

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.742
You're some Brawler...using computers

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.043
as a crutch!

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.945
I assure you, Ace, they are not a crutch.

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:01.847
But a very useful tool.

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.415
Perhaps you need another demonstration.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.017
[evil laughter]

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.893
[Grunting, pain]

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:14.994

[\u266a]

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.801
We took a beating on that one...Time to crash

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.904
Mylene's hard drive.

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:28.574
Percival Brawl!

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.576
Macubass, finish them!

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.778

Marina Cavitation!

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.120
Where did he go?

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.955
He's camouflaged himself in the water.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:47.126
I guess we need to smoke him out...Gate Card open!

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:51.597
Why isn't my Gate Card working?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.465
When Marina Cavitation is activated,

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.336
it blocks one's opponent from opening their Gate

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:59.038

[Grunt, pain]

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.683
I hate those things...they need to be

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.885
swatted like the flies they are.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.954
By the time you figure out how to do that,

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:18.190
this battle will be over...Strike!

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.125
[grunting, pain]

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:22.328

Yes, Master Klaus. As you wish.

Your elegance is surpassed by none...my precious

Sirenoid...Battling becomes you.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.539
Thank you for your praise, but a Bakugan is only as

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.775
good as their Master Brawler.

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:11.277
Who do you guys think you are?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.911
And what's the big idea, interrupting my

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.280
battle like that?

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:17.216
I believe we were saving you ...The only true match

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.752
for an Aquos is another Aquos...Even you,

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:22.588
the mighty Ace must admit your were having a spot of

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:23.722
trouble there.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.025
But how do you know who I am?

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.761
Let's just say, I make it my business to be in the know...

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:31.830
Let's get back to the task at hand and finish this Vexos?

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.232
How rude.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.935
I'll have to teach you some manners...ABSIDS!

[\u266a]

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.765
Hmmmmm.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.634
Now Ace...Open your Gate Card.

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:11.103
I don't need you to tell me how to Brawl, okay?

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.838

It's clear you cannot escape defeat, Vexos.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.550
It's best if you graciously retreated now.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.585
You're beautiful and a worthy opponent...

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.420
I am a gentleman there's no reason for further

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.841
Thunder Sword!

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:58.343
Fusion ability, activate!

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.512
Deadly Karbia!

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:07.920
[\u266a]

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:13.325
[Mighty roar]

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:22.367
[\u266a]

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.970
That's how you win a brawl.

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:29.441
Sirenoid, I must thank you for your assistance.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.843
No thanks necessary.

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:32.311
My pleasure.

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:35.314
You battled very well today,

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:37.950
Sirenoid...I believe you've made me the

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:40.319
proudest master in all of Vestal.

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:43.121
Thank you so much, Master Klaus.

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:46.258
Aquos Sirenoid and Master Klaus...Ah yes...I

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.661
remember you now...you are a Bakugan Brawler from

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.396
Earth are you not?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.765
Huh?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.201
I didn't realize that the Vestals had joined forces

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:58.470
with more humans from Earth.

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.938
Enjoy your victory while you can,

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.508
Brawlers...When I come back with my Vexos

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:05.911
teammates...nothing will be left.

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:12.351
Hey, Ace!

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:13.552
Huh?

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.188
Did I make it in time?

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:19.258
Aren't you...? You're a Bakugan Brawler from Earth?

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.361
You better tell me who you are, right now.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.731
I am a descendant of German nobility.

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:26.899
You are?

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.934
But on Vestal, I'm known more as a young Real

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.502
Estate tycoon.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:31.637
What?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.605
But what you really should know is...

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:40.412
Together with the Battle Brawlers I helped free

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:43.315
Vestroia as a Bakugan Brawler.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.983
I am the Aquos Prince...

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.585
I am Klaus Von Hertzig!

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.654
And he's also my hero!

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.255
Ah ha!

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.758
I knew I recognized you from somewhere!

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.560
...Hey Ace, I told you abut this guy.

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:57.563
On Earth he was one of Master Dan's strongest rivals.

00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:00.265
Just tell us what you're doing here on Vestal.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.768
For quite some time now...we've been funding

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:06.371
the important research that Dr. Michael's been conducting.

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:08.807
That relationship led to me taking part in the test

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.177
run of the newly upgraded dimension transporter system.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.846
First I went to New Vestroia to meet up with Sirenoid.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.315
Then together we came to Vestal,

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.016
where we've made a home for ourselves.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.320
Is the transporter system how Mira made her way to Earth?

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.988
If it weren't for the generous support from the

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.957
Klaus Foundation, Inter-dimensional

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.859
transportation wouldn't be where it is today.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.628
Alright, let's go, shall we?

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.199
Where exactly are we going?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.835
To my castle of course...We'll use some of

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.704
the transporter technology,

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.974
we'll to send a message to Dan and the others on Earth.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.744
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:47.679
How did you know we wanted to contact Dan and the

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.147
other Brawlers?

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.950
Like I said before, it's my business to be in the know...

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:56.388
I never fall behind 'cause I'm always one step ahead.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.624
[\u266a]

00:20:58.657 --> 00:20:59.858
Ace, my boy.

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.393
I have so much to teach you.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.862
Dude, I told you before, quit calling me boy.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.534
When we heard that the Vexos had returned to

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:12.504
Vestal we knew something had to be done.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.473
But just as we were making our way to Dr. Michael's

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.775
lab to use the Dimension Transporter,

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:19.177
something happened in New Vestroia.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.046
I decided to investigate.

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:23.215
While they carried on to Vestal I made my own way

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:24.549
to New Vestroia.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.352
And once I got there I couldn't believe what I saw.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.654
Once you check it out for yourself,

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:31.056
you won't believe it either.

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.791
Bakugan, brawl!

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.259
[\u266a]

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.460
Be there!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:46.838
[\u266a]

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:56.481
[\u266a]
