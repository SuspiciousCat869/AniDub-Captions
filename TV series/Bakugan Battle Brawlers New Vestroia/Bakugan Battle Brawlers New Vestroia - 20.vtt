00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.508
DAN: When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.310
and captured all the Bakugan,

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.978
they didn't count on Drago and I

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.748
returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.116
DAN: Time to get...

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.417
serious!

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.954
DAN: So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.723
DAN: Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.191
take back New Vestroia

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.161
and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.362
INGRAM: [battle squawk]

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.797
DAN: Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.165
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.168
DRAGO: [roaring]

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are you going to do? \u266a

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.844
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.646
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.981
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.849
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.251
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.286
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.754
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.959
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.929
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:03.997
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.933
DAN: I'm sorry you're not coming...

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.967
Don't worry.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.169
I'll be back.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:21.981
[\u266a]

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:28.955
BARON: [goofy falling yell]

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.992
[\u266a]

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.867
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Beta City Blues\".

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.538
BARON: [goofy falling yell]

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.640
Ow! That stings.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.442
DAN: Where are we?

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.250
NEMUS: The colour of the sky, the smell of the air,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.719
the power rising from the soil...

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.954
DRAGO: We made it home...

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:03.890
APOLLONIR: Yes, we are back in New Vestroia.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.792
DRAGO: Apollonir!

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.393
APOLLONIR: With the return of Drago,

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.330
the Perfect Core is once again stable.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.266
APOLLONIR: But New Vestroia is far from out of danger.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.469
The ambition of the Vexos must be crushed.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.204
DAN: Great Apollonir...

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.639
You can count on us!

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.707
Right, Baron?

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.809
BARON: Right, Master Dan!

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:26.346
BARON: I just wish Mira was here.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.947
DAN: Miraaaaa!

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.355
DAN: Let's face facts, Baron, Mira's gone...

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.323
We gotta find Shun and the others.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.859
BARON: You're right!

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.833
BARON: Ace!

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.001
Shun!

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.036
Marucho!

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.439
BARON: This place is deserted.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.675
BARON: Where is everyone?

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.645
NEMUS: It looks like no one's been here for days.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.947
BARON: Let's find out where we are.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.153
DAN: Whatcha got?

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.855
BARON: It's coming up now.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:09.923
BARON: Look.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.458
The trailer is very close to Beta City.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.427
They must have gone there.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.662
DRAGO: That makes sense.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.963
DAN: Yah Drago...

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.365
I bet they're going to destroy the Dimension Controller...

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.001
I say we follow them and give them a little back up.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.069
BARON: [grunting in agreement]

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.470
DAN: Let's show the Vexos...

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.573
what we've got!

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.651
MYLENE: Spectra!

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.986
MYLENE: So...

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.788
You've decided to grace us with your presence.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:43.990
GUS: That's right...

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.391
We had a little bit of help

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.293
from one of the six ancient warriors.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.895
VOLT: Yeah, right, Gus.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:50.196
SHADOW PROVE: Too bad...

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.832
I thought you were stuck on that garbage planet for good.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.500
[crazy chuckle]

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.469
LYNC: Nice to see you too, guys.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.171
SPECTRA: Any news, Mylene?

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.505
MYLENE: [angry frustration]...

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.176
MYLENE: What is she doing here?

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.444
MYLENE: You fool.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.579
That traitor has no business being here.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.147
MYLENE: Explain this.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.415
SPECTRA: Mira Fermin...

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.718
has joined the Vexos...

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.987
Accept it... or else.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.021
MYLENE: What?

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.155
SHADOW PROVE: [evil chuckle]

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.790
SPECTRA: Isn't that right, Mira?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.395
MIRA: He's right...

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:25.031
THINKING: All I want to do is find out what Keith is doing...

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.967
SHADOW PROVE: Smart thinking there, Fermin.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.303
You can take it from me. Ha!

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.339
The Battle Brawlers Resistance is history.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.443
MIRA: [horrified gasp]

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.379
SHADOW PROVE: [evil laugh]

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.948
SHADOW PROVE: Not so tough right now, are they?

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.118
And when the others get here, we'll pickle them too.

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.119
[evil laugh]

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.620
MIRA: It's Ace...

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.022
and Shun...

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.223
and Marucho...

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.030
HYDRON: It's good to have you back Lync?

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.132
And what of Spectra?

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.034
LYNC: He doesn't suspect anything.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.069
LYNC: He's been up to his old tricks.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.838
Strutting and trying to boss everyone around.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.674
HYDRON: [laughs] Excellent.

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:11.210
Then I will have him battle for me a little longer.

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.480
HYDRON: You know I am counting on you, Lync.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.416
LYNC: Count on me?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.251
You can count on me to do...

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.019
what's best for me.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.965
DAN: So that's Beta City.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.434
BARON: Is that water?

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.469
I don't swim so good.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.970
DRAGO: It's water all right.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.372
Like a moat.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.875
Difficult to penetrate.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.378
DAN: Looks like we're getting wet.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.519
DAN: [alarmed] What's going on?!

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:54.687
BARON: [alarmed]

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.197
DAN: [groan] Man, I've got bruises on my bruises.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.598
BARON: Me too.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:09.435
DAN: Where are we?

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.371
BARON: Looks like... a battle arena...

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.675
SPECTRA: So you found your way back.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.778
DAN: Spectra!

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.647
SPECTRA: You should have learned by now, Dan Kuso...

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.983
Staying in your own world and minding your business

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.652
would save you so much suffering.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:29.122
DAN: You can't shake us.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.860
MYLENE: If you have something to say, say it to us.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.395
SHADOW PROVE: We're here to stamp out your little

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.996
Resistance for good!

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.898
[maniacal laugh]

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.266
BARON: Whaddya think?

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.568
DAN: Some freaks never get the message.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:45.671
DRAGO: At least they saved us the trouble of sneaking in.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.142
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.977
BARON: Ready for action, Nemus?

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.012
NEMUS: Anytime, Baron.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.981
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet Activated.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.716
BOTH: Gauntlet!

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.551
Power Strike!

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.225
SHADOW PROVE: So...

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.961
which one of you dweiners wants to be ripped apart first?

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.831
Of course I could crush you both at the same time.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.367
[maniacal laugh]

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.701
DAN: Here's the plan, dude...

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.070
We keep this battle going as long as we can.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.939
BARON: But... what's the point?

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.073
DAN: Listen...

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.442
the longer we brawl, the more energy builds up.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.610
DRAGO: Exactly.

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.279
Just like Shun and Ace's battle destroyed

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.214
the Alpha City Controller.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.550
NEMUS: We'll overload the Dimension Controller

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.651
and it should...

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.420
blow sky high!

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:36.222
BARON: Brilliant, Master Dan.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.356
DAN: Alright...

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.691
Now let's get a little back and forth going

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.860
to warm up.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.396
SHADOW PROVE: Working on your strategy, kids?

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.531
You're playing with the big boys now.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.266
MYLENE: Calm down, mushbrain.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.734
SHADOW PROVE: Hey, no way...

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.136
You're not the boss of me.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.404
DAN: No, but I am!

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:53.139
And I'm taking control!

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.708
Gate Card Set!

00:07:58.711 --> 00:07:59.879
DAN: All right...

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.380
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.515
SHADOW PROVE: Whatever, dweeb...

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.883
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.051
BARON: My turn!

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.452
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.655
SHADOW PROVE: No fair!

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.858
DAN: Pyrus Dragoniod Stand!

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.360
DRAGO: [battle attack roar]

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:17.129
BARON: Haos Nemus, Stand!

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.211
I'm ready for you!

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.146
SHADOW PROVE: Hades is charged up again

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.914
to maximum power!

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.016
So let's light it up!

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:03.622
SHADOW PROVE: I like my dragonoids extra crispy!

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:07.259
Saurer Cannon... Engage!

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.896
DRAGO: [summoning power roar]

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.164
DAN: Finally!

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.233
Ability Activate!

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:17.236
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set!

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.738
DAN: Dragon Contender!

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:24.343
DRAGO: [battle roar]

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.978
SHADOW PROVE: Unbelievable!

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.913
MYLENE: Nothing! No effect!

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.715
DAN: Sorry to disappoint you guys!

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.917
But Dragon Contenter ability taps

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.118
into the Perfect Core's power...

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.687
It brings the opponent's Power Level back down

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.156
to its base level...

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:40.092
...and adds 600 to Drago's power level!

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.261
BARON: Awesome, Master Dan!

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.429
NEMUS: Drago is...

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:44.897
a true warrior!

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.633
SHADOW PROVE: No fair! No fair! You're a goner!

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.235
SHADOW PROVE: Take your best shot, lizard breath!

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:53.272
DRAGO: [battle roar]

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.008
HADES: [extreme pain squeal]

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.448
DRAGO: [triumphant roar]

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.849
SHADOW PROVE: Huh?

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.284
That's it?

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:08.921
DAN: Let's see how much power this Controller can take!

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:11.290
ACE: Drago!

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:13.358
MARUCHO: Where'd he get that kind of power?

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.462
PERCIVAL: The power is more than just Drago.

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.331
INGRAM: It's the power of the Perfect Core!

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.867
DAN: Drago! Let's go!

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.435
DRAGO: [defiant roar]

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.103
MYLENE: I'm not done yet...

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:28.273
Elico Ultimate Ability Activate!

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.209
MYLENE: Scramble Zwei!

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.543
ELICO: [powering up growl]

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.911
MYLENE: You'll love this one.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.413
MYLENE: It doubles Elico's base Power Level

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.149
and knocks 400 off yours! Hah!

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:42.187
MYLENE: Now even the perfect dragonoid can't take you...

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.889
Go Eilco!

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:45.724
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Activated!

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.159
DAN: Let's finish it!

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.494
DAN: Ability Activate!

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:50.229
Strike Dragon!

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:54.299
DRAGO: [powering up roar]

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.401
GAUNTLET: Power Level Exchange Complete!

00:18:56.435 --> 00:19:06.478
[battle roar]

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:13.785
[battle roar]

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.059
MYLENE: It can't be...

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:22.427
How could I lose?

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.129
MYLENE: My plan was perfect!

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:27.099
DAN: Yes! We did it! Feel it?

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:32.004
DRAGO: [triumphant roar]

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.474
DAN: Doesn't matter how much extra power you set

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.609
the Dimension Controller to take.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.478
It's nothing compared to Drago

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.246
and the Perfect Core!

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:49.588
ELFIN: [happy giggle!] We're baaaaaaack!

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.456
MARUCHO: [happy] Hey guys!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.825
ELFIN: Drago sure did a number on that Controller!

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.827
DAN: Oh man... are you okay?

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.963
ACE: You made it back just in time.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:00.265
MARUCHO: You the man! Well after me!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.533
[happy laughter]

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.136
DRAGO: Talk later. Let's get out of here.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.381
MYLENE: They destroyed Beta City's Dimension Controller...

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.617
and all of our prisoners have escaped.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.752
MYLENE: This is all your fault!

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.754
MIRA: No it's not.

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.189
MYLENE: You let her join us...

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.825
You took the enemy in and look what happened.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.193
MYLENE: Well, Spectra?

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.828
SPECTRA: Do you doubt me, Mylene?

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.263
SPECTRA: Be careful.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.465
GUS: Actually, this is your fault, Mylene.

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:34.866
MYLENE: My Fault?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.001
GUS: Of course.

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:38.103
You're the one who lost the brawl...

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.305
Yet you accuse Master Spectra?

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:42.107
MYLENE: [resentful]

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.342
VOLT: [annoyed]

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.611
SHADOW PROVE: [frustrated growl]

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.547
SHADOW PROVE: No fair!

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.848
I want a do over!

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.116
[frustrated Grrrr]

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:52.284
VOLT: Chill out, freak.

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:53.752
LYNC: Wanna see the playback of your loss, Shadow?

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.087
SHADOW PROVE: Be Quiet!

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.055
MIRA THINKING: I came to find answers

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.858
but I'm more confused than ever now.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.196
What are you up to... Keith?

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.635
SPECTRA: This is Spectra.

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.970
At last my dear sister and I are reunited.

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.373
SPECTRA: Come and you eat with your brother Mira.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.208
SPECTRA: I've given her back her home, her family

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.478
and even spared the lives of her little friends.

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.547
But she's still not happy.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.416
MIRA: I challenge you Keith...

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.385
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.688
SPECTRA: But then, every family has its little arguments.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:32.758
SPECTRA: And it's time I showed Mira my true power!

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.826
SPECTRA: Bakugan brawl!

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.428
SPECTRA: Bring it on, little sister!
