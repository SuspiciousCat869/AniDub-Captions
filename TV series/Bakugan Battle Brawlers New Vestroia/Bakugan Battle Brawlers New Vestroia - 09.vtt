00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.741
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.909
were on a mission to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.077
So we joined up

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.912
with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.582
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.885
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.388
Every battle makes us stronger

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.857
and brings us closer to our goal.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.760
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension Controllers

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.328
to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.663
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.499
We're ready to roll...

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.668
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.505
\u266a What are you going to do? \u266a

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.875
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.877
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.078
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.980
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.314
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.150
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.551
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.553
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.121
\u266a On the inside

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.457
[\u266a]

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.326
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.296
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.431
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to the final match

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.309
of the Bakugan Battle Tournament!

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.211
The pressure's on to see which tag team

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.280
will emerge victorious!

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.783
Will it be the mysterious duo known only as...

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.052
...the Bakugan Brawlers!

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.556
Or maybe...

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.458
Our very own masters of mayhem,

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.259
the kings of chaos...

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.961
...the undisputed destroyers

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.363
of all who dare to stand in their way...

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.100
Lync and Volt of the Vexos!

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.201
[laugh] Hey there!

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.335
Good to be here!

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.336
Love you too!

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.404
You're the best!

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.406
Knock those new guys right out of the arena!

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.482
No need to look so serious, Bakugan Brawlers...

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:56.950
or maybe...

00:01:56.983 --> 00:02:00.720
I should call you the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance?

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.222
[grunt]

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.057
I don't know what you think you're up to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.124
but I'm gonna love...

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.327
taking your Bakugan.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.628
Just try it.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.230
Careful, we've got to make this fight last

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.764
as long as we can.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:19.372
[\u266a]

Aw snap!

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.025
Which way is it to the controller?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.493
BARON: Let me check...

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.161
I think it's this way.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.663
We've got to hurry...

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:47.834
Shun and Ace's battle will be starting any minute now.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.369
Dan! [panting]

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.838
Hey, wait for me!

[exhausted grunt]

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.941
Hey, me too. Wait up, guys!

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.109
Hurry up, Marucho.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.510
You're too slow!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.979
I can't go on anymore...

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.783
[exhausted sigh]

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.819
AHH!

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.289
Hey, where is Marucho?

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.357
Should I go back for him?

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.358
[panting] Nah.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.927
He was never any good at marathons.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.662
We'll get him on the way back.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:31.411
[\u266a]

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.046
Bakugan?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.582
What are they doing in there?

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.017
They've been put into a state of suspension.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.087
DRAGO: It's worse than I expected.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.288
No!

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.656
The Bakugan...

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.191
must be freed ...

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.626

He's right...

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.599
We won't be able to free them

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.668
until we've destroyed the Dimension Controller.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.769
Fine...

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.371
Then let's go...

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.440
I can't stand watching this...

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.710
You! Freeze!

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.279
This is a restricted area.

You're using Darkus?

Then I'll pull out...

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.968

Well, there's a big surprise, right kids?

There's no one who can beat the Vexos.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.632
We're gonna prove you wrong!

We're fighting to free them and their land!

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.415
A talking... Bakugan?

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:30.483
That's impossible!

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.151
DRAGO: No it isn't.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.886
We're living evidence!

You can't deny this anymore!

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.024
Do what's right.

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:40.560
Help us free the Bakugan.

[painful groan]

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.703
Oh Boy! That's gotta hurt.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.104
Did I survive?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.806
Sorry guys.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.041
Got a bit lost.

but the Bakugan Brawlers are totally outclassed

when it comes to the all-powerful Team Vexos!

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:42.535
This match is as good as over.

But I'm having so much fun...

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.541

What an unbelievable comeback!

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.959
Our big match of the century turned out to be

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.061
a big, belly flop!

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:18.964

What'd I tell ya?

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.882
Now if I were a \"reverse power\" switch,

where would I hide?

DRAGO: There it is!

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.453
It can't be this easy.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.788

[tired breathing]

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:10.549
But do the Battle Brawlers have to will to win?

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.152
We'll show them who's got the will to win.

ANNOUNCER: And Volt pulls out the heavy artillery!

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.851
With that Darkus ability,

You're not wimping out on me are you?

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:07.940
Open up or we'll bust the door down!

[worried breathing]

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.110
What do we do now, Drago?

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.145
You can't get through but I can.

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:15.381
Well how?

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.815
If you throw me in a straight line

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.350
between laser beams...

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:19.985
I can reach the switch.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.220
See?

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.354
But...

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.489
What if...

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:24.923
I miss, Drago?

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:25.925
You'll be...

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.493
You won't miss, Dan.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:30.329
I trust you.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.332
Let's do this...

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.100
For the Bakugan...

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.469
This is where all that practice pays off!

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.537
Right!

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.176
Last chance.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:47.579

You haven't won yet...

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.085
We've dragged this battle out to stall for time.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.686
Stalling?

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.621
We've been letting the power in the stadium build

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.223

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:33.292

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.066
ANNOUNCER: And the action just keeps heating up!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.769
The Brawlers have knocked out Brontes' ability.

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.972
Say bye-bye to the Dark Scythe!

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.944
GAUNTLET: Percival Power Level 750.

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.546
Brontes Power Level 300.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.550
Now you will learn what true Darkus power can do!

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:05.424
Too much power!

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:08.560
Brontes!

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.097
ANNOUNCER: And that's all she wrote for Volt!

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.700
Ability Activate!

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:16.368
Spinal Saucer!

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.471
Ability Actvate!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:21.173
Armored Victory!

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:26.412
No way!

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:29.148
[bird attack cry]

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.716
Ability Activate!

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.384
Hybrid Cannon!

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:34.920
It won't work!

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:36.422
I figured out your weakness!

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.424
Ability Activate!

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:42.061
Continuous Dance, Phoenix Position!

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.731
Double ability Activate!

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:49.435
Thunderbolt Torrential Wave plus Thunder Power...

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:53.672
Glimmering Sash!

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:54.973
ANNOUNCER: Whoa!

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.309
Ingram and Hylash are double-teaming Meta Altair!

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.912
He's taking hit after hit!

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:04.483
[defeated squeal/feedback]

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.624
ANNOUNCER: What a comeback!

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.360
Our unknown challengers devastate the Vexos!

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:18.831
New Vestroia has brand, new champions!

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:24.536
Let's hear it for your new, top ranked team,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.739
The Bakugan Brawlers!

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:37.816
[\u266a]

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:46.258
[\u266a]

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:52.231
[angry roar]

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.199
Pick on someone your own size!

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:55.467
Let's go! Run!

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.069
DAN: We did it!

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.505
DRAGO: The Dimension Controller has been destroyed.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:01.306
Thanks to us!

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:09.548
[angry roars]

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:10.849
What's happening?

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.618
It's an earthquake!

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.120
Oh great.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.121
Look out!

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.824
[angry roar]

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:20.592
Nice work. Yeah.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.265
I think it's time to go!

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.834
Yeah, don't wanna get stomped.

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.670
ANNOUNCER: The B-Bakugan are out!

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:33.338
But there isn't even a battle!

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:34.506
Where are they coming from?

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.607
Run!

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:36.708
Run away!

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:37.743
[frightened scream]

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:38.944
Wait!

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:40.779
You have nothing to be afraid of...

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:44.116
The Bakugan are living, intelligent beings!

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.617
She speaks the truth.

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.352
That Bakugan spoke!

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.421
But that's impossible!

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.990
The Bakugan deserve their freedom...

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.625
They are our friends.

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:55.194
The Bakugan are...

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.562
Our friends?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.803
[screaming]

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.478
Is everyone all right?

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:16.715
Yeah!

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.022
BAKUGAN: Thank you all for freeing us.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.324
Don't thank us...

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:27.326
We're all in this together.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.628
There's still a lot more Bakugan to free.

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:33.932
Then we wish to join the Bakugan Battle Brawler Resistance.

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.668
We want to help New Vestroia.

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:37.836
Yes!

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.771
We want to fight too!

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:40.772
Me too!

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:42.140
Too awesome!

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:44.710
Our team's getting bigger every day!

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.078
Then it's settled.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.714
We stand or fall united.

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.583
The Vexos don't have a chance against us!

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:54.353
We're still pretty badly outnumbered, though.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.522
Just the way we like it? Right?

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:58.690
[agreement grunt]

00:20:58.724 --> 00:20:59.958
Alright!

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:01.693
I am seriously stoked.

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:04.162
We're going to start a Bakugan revolution!

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:06.665
[cheering]

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:11.837
DAN: Things may be looking up in New Vestroia

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.438
but they're heating up back home!

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.507
We're about get an unexpected visit from...

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.575
Runo!

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.111
Runo?

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.946
But our old friend brings new troubles when the

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:23.615
dimensional gate between worlds becomes unstable,

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.217
with Runo trapped inside!

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.452
If we can't hold the Vexos off long enough

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.655
to save our pal and save two worlds...

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:32.357
Runo may be lost forever!

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:33.992
Check it out, next time!

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:36.194
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.429
See you then!
