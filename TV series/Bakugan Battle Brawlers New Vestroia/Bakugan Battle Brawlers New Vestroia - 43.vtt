WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.342
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.011
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with him

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.481
the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.384
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.352
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.955
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.456
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.259
and transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.294
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.930
into more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.632
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan was in our hands

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.100
and the stakes were high.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.568
But we won the fight!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.338
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.743
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.746
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.181
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.016
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.420
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.130
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.503
DAN: Alright.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.704
I think that's everyone.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.506
DAN: It's a good thing we triple checked.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.541
It'd be a huge drag

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.010
if we accidentally left somebody behind.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.611
MARUCHO: I thought we were the ones who were gonna

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.547
get left behind when Spectra took off on us.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.614
BARON: No kidding.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.216
Lucky for us Drago's new powers allowed him

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.485
to open up a dimension gate for us.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:26.619
DRAGO: The most important thing

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.588
is that the BT System is history.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.858
VERIAS: It's because of your bravery that New Vestroia

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.726
and the Bakugan race were saved

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.562
from annihilation.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.465
VERIAS: Thank-you Brawlers and brother Drago.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.500
DAN: Haha! No problem Verias.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.702
Any time pal! Ready?

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:43.736
DRAGO: Ready!

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.538
Back to Earth!

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:51.044
[\u266a]

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.549
RUNO: [sigh]

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.121
SHUN: [grunt]

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.323
JULIE: Hey, you guys are back.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.390
That was fast.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.792
RUNO: [excited squeak]

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.328
DAN: [grunt]

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.297
RUNO: Welcome back, Dan.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.067
DAN: It's good to be home.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.072
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.940
Phantom Data Attack

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.010
KLAUS: So what you are saying is, the Bakugan

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.912
that you evacuated to Earth have now safely

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.814
returned to New Vestroia?

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.483
KLAUS: That's great news.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.553
MIRA: It's a miracle we were able to save them all.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.625
MIRA: I honestly thought Drago and the others were goners...

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.427
Luckily he was able to drag the BT System

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.429
up into the atmosphere and destroy it.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.367
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.571
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.944
DAN: Drago absorbed the attribute energies that

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:01.481
were powering the system... Now he's evolved again.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.117
BARON: What a way to really stick it to the Vexos!

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.085
DRAGO: At the time, I was only concerned with saving

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.155
New Vestroia and my brothers and sisters.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.925
MARUCHO: Do we know what happened to the Vexos?

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.893
KLAUS: As soon as you guys radioed me...

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.929
KLAUS: ...I conducted a scan on the Dimension Universe

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.697
looking for the Mother Palace...

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.766
KLAUS: ...but it seems I was too late.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.035
There was no sign of them anywhere.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.369
ACE: [grunt]

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.838
So those lousy creeps escaped into another dimension?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.273
Unbelievable!

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.843
PERCIVAL: I guess we won the battle and not the war.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.645
JULIE: Oh man!

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.447
Just when you think it's over!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.215
RUNO: I thought we were done

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.584
looking over our shoulders.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.686
DAN: Okay... Take it easy, guys...

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.287
If they show their ugly mugs around here,

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.655
we'll take 'em down again!

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.824
Drago can beat anything they throw at us.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.495
DAN: He's evolved into a Helix Dragonoid.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.397
DAN: Let's see those mechanical pieces of junk

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.166
even try something.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.335
DRAGO: Yes! I dare them!

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.803
KLAUS: I had better stay here in Vestal

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.771
to keep an eye out, just in case.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.975
Just in case Zenoheld and the Vexos decide to return.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.910
MIRA: That's a great idea. Thanks Klaus.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.211
KLAUS: Not at all.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:06.713
I'm just trying to do my share you guys.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:07.981
I guess it's the - huh?

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.282
SIRENOID: Master Klaus?

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.617
It's almost time for the Klaus Foundation Executive

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.385
Branch board meeting.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.187
SIRENOID: After that you have a lunch meeting

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.556
with Vestal's new government officials

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.358
and then this afternoon we have the shoot

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.659
for the new Real Estate commercial.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.229
KLAUS: Thank-you for reminding me, my dear.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.964
DAN: Sounds like you're staying in Vestal

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.600
for a few reasons other than the Vexos, buddy.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.169
KLAUS: Well, that's life in the fast lane, my boy.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.105
I guess until next time.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.340
DAN: Take it easy, Klaus.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.975
DAN: I guess if you guys wanna head back home

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.144
to Vestal too, that's cool.

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.780
BARON: Actually Dan, I was kinda hoping to stay here

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.882
on Earth to continue my training.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.050
DAN: Yeah?

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.385
BARON: Watching you and Drago brawling

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.452
has inspired me.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.321
I wanna get better. To be like you.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.190
So how 'bout it, huh? How 'bout it?

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.925
NEMUS: I would be honoured if you would let me study

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.762
under you as well, Helix Dragonoid.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.330
DRAGO: Of course.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.232
ACE: I was thinking of sticking around too.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.533
BOTH: Huh?

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:04.070
ACE: After defeating the Vexos, I'm totally pumped.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.705
PERCIVAL: Oh me too.

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:07.306
Everything inside of me is saying that I need to train

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.609
and become stronger.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.277
DAN: Alright then.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.179
Let's all brush up on our brawling skills.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.348
That way we'll be ready if the Vexos show up again.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:16.983
MARUCHO: I agree with you Dan.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.718
I'll go prepare the Bakugan Interspace system

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.386
for battle.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.188
DAN: That's a perfect idea, Marucho.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.656
MARUCHO: Mmmmhmmm. DAN: Mmmmhmmm.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.925
DAN: Yeah! This is gonna be awesome!

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.794
RUNO: I can't believe they just got back and already

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.462
they want to brawl again.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.663
JULIE: You know boys.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:32.165
They've got one-track minds.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.566
RUNO: I'm home!

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.368
TATSUO: Runo! You're back!

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.170
Get over here and give your old man a hug!

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:38.638
TATSUO: Oh, I missed you so much!

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.940
I'm so glad you're home, my baby girl!

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.376
RUNO: [delighted squeals]

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.045
JULIE: Don't you just love family reunions?

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.650
MIYOKO: Okay kids, dig in!

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.352
MIYOKO: I made all your favourites.

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:56.189
MIYOKO: This is in honour of your return, Daniel.

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:58.391
We missed you terribly.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:00.359
SHINJIRO: Don't disappoint your mom, my boy.

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:02.228
Make sure you clean your plate.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:05.898
DAN: Don't worry. I will. Thanks Mom. You're the best.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.400
MIYOKO: [giggle]

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.203
MIRA: Dan's family is so great.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.575
MIRA: I wonder if my Dad and my brother and I

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:19.412
will ever be a family again.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.948
ACE: Mira...Why the long face?

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.485
We won. Just cheer up. Life is good! Okay?

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:26.719
MIRA: Ace...uh...

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.920
ACE: Don't say anything.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:30.189
Just eat up and look happy for Dan's mom.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.591
And...Huh?

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.593
MIYOKO: Did you leave any room for your favourite?

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.094
Sweet and sour pork?

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.663
ACE: I...uh...um...

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.332
BARON: Mmmmm.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.601
Your cooking is the greatest, Master Dan's Mom!

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.169
I can't get enough!

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.971
I just can't get enough of it.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.039
MIYOKO: Why thank-you, Baron, sweetie.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.875
You okay, dear?

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.444
Eat up before it gets cold, okay?

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.079
DAN: Common Mira, eat up.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.914
MIRA: Uh...

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:58.050
DRAGO: Humans are strange.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.319
WILLDA: Always celebrating with food.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.622
PERCIVAL: Or consoling themselves.

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:05.658
NEMUS: And then there's Baron.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.828
PERCIVAL: He never stops eating does he?

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.797
ALL: [laughter]

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.099
[ringing]

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.634
DAN: Uh...Hello?

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:15.902
MARUCHO: Hey Dan!

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.671
DAN: Yeah Marucho. What's up? We're just eating.

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:22.575
So is the Bakugan Interspace ready yet there buddy?

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.210
MARUCHO: That's just it, Dan.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:26.412
You guys need to get down here to see this.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.151
DAN: Hey! What's happening?

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.353
MARUCHO: Well, it seems when they fired it up...

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.389
MARUCHO: ... the technicians found some phantom data...

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.425
...that we've never seen in the Bakugan Interspace before.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.027
OPERATOR A: Marucho, we've isolated the location

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.628
of the anomaly.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.463
It appears that it's inside the battlefield.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.432
OPERATOR B: Yes, and it shows that the data signature

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.435
is consistent with that of a Bakugan.

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.137
DAN: What exactly does that mean?

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.905
Tell us.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.842
DRAGO: A Bakugan has found its way inside.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.677
BARON: But how'd it do that?

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.812
SHUN: And who do you think it could be?

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.914
MIRA: The enemy, I bet.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.583
DAN: Why sit around here guessing...

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.552
When can go inside and find out for sure?

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.387
MARUCHO: Mmmmmhmmm.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:18.698
MIRA: It feels different than the last time we were here.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.833
ACE: Yeah, like something scary's gonna jump out

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.535
and grab us any second.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.971
BARON: Stop it, guys. You're freaking me out.

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.813
MARUCHO: Shall we go in Dan?

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:34.881
DAN: Mmmhhmmm.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:44.457
DAN: Huh, look at that.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.692
There's nothing here...

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.960
Whoa!

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.295
DRAGO: What the...?

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.863
ALL: [gasp]

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.342
DAN: Stay close everyone.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.977
Those guys could be dangerous!

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.682
BARON: I've never seen Bakugan like these before!

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:16.555
DAN: Who the heck are these guys?

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:17.990
You got any clue there?

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.358
Huh Drago, buddy?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.726
DRAGO: I have no idea.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.929
I've never seen them before.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.497
DAN: Whoa! No way!

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.898
SHUN: How can there be Bakugan

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.066
that even Drago doesn't know about?

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.267
MIRA: Oh no!

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.702
Maybe they're Mechanical Bakugan

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.337
that the Vexos have created.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.005
BARON: Whah? MARUCHO: Huh? DAN: No way!

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.441
DRAGO: No, they're not Mechanical Bakugan.

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.143
INGRAM: He's right,

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.844
but they're awfully suspicious looking.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.913
MARUCHO: Scanners indicate they are digital clones

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.182
synthesized from the phantom data.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.117
MIRA: What's that? Digital clones?

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.252
MARUCHO: Ya Mira.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.487
The Bakugan Interspace is a virtual environment

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.791
so they must be mirror images of what they are in the real world.

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.926
OPERATOR A: Sir, we think we've isolated

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.594
the source of the phantom data that created

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.697
the mysterious digital clones.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.398
OPERATOR A: It appears as though it came from

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.500
the rogue transmission that we accidentally intercepted

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.803
the other day.

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.705
MARUCHO: The rogue transmission.

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.740
Of course, that's it.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.775
DAN: Marucho... do you mind...

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.510
translating for us, pal?

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.279
DRAGO: Yes, please do.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:14.714
MARUCHO: Well, what happened was...

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:15.848
OPERATOR A: Oh no!

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.350
An anomalous signal has accessed the mainframe

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.485
and is transferring a large amount of data.

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.253
OPERATOR B: We can't identify the source

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.789
or even the nature of the data transfer,

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.925
just that it looks to be massive in volume.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.997
MARUCHO: What is that?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.798
MARUCHO: The signal had an encryption so complex

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:35.101
I've never seen anything like it...

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.437
Because of that we couldn't trace it.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.239
MARUCHO: All we could do was analyze the data,

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:43.175
but it was such a huge amount we hadn't finished before...

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.910
...we had to depart for the attack mission

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.947
at the Mother Palace.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.281
DAN: Listen up!

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:50.683
DAN: You guys better tell us who you are

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.518
and where you're from.

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.587
Whoa!

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.891
DAN: [angry grunt] Well this is getting us nowhere.

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:01.060
ACE: They're either shy or just mocking us,

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:03.396
but either way they're ticking me off.

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:06.098
It's like dealing with spoiled children.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.433
Know what I mean?

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.001
MIRA: There's not much we can do if we can't even

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.436
communicate with them.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.104
BARON: I know a way that they might prefer

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.305
to communicate.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.840
If they don't wanna talk then maybe they'll wanna

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.976
brawl us in a battle.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.881
BARON: Bakugan style, of course.

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:24.016
NEMUS: That idea works for me.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.518
DAN: Nice one, dude.

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:26.685
Huh?

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:28.354
Looks like you've got your opponent, Baron.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:30.056
BARON: This is too awesome.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.857
Looks like this one's a Haos Bakugan,

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.359
so me and Nemus...

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:36.195
oh yeah, we'll take him down alright.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.897
NEMUS: I'm ready when you are, Baron.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.598
SHUN: But those Bakugan don't have partner

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.233
Brawlers to guide them.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.868
How's this gonna work you guys?

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:44.170
MIRA: Yeah guys.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.272
How can you possibly Brawl without a Brawler?

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:49.208
MARUCHO: Leave that to me, guys.

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:51.444
BARON: Whah ?

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:57.083
BARON: Whoa! What the heck?

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.819
MARUCHO: Based on your vital statistics Baron,

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:02.288
I have created an opponent Avatar of you.

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:07.159
MARUCHO: Now you can do battle against Avatar Baron.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.761
DAN: I dunno.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.163
This is kinda weird but cool at the same time.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:12.598
Know what I mean?

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.799
DRAGO: Yes.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.469
BARON: Alright, let's get this party started, yo!

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.904
AVATAR BARON: Let's get this party started, yo.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.608
DAN: Crazy.

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.443
BARON: No more like...creepy.

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.145
This is weird.

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.352
MARUCHO: Whoa. Check it out.

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:34.720
Did you see his eyes?

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:36.021
That's weird.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.757
I wonder if it's a bug from the phantom data.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.358
ACE: Why do I feel like we're in for a surprise

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.960
this battle?

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.695
DAN: Keep your guard up, Baron!

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:45.164
BARON: I got it!

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:47.233
BOTH: Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:50.769
AVATAR BARON: Gate Card, set!

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:53.539
AVATAR BARON: Get ready.

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.274
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:57.376
AVATAR BARON: Bakugan Stand!

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:00.579
AVATAR BARON: Rise Haos Arnaut!

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.582
BARON: A power level of 900?

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.751
BARON: This is unbelievable!

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.287
NEMUS: Time to show them what we've got, Baron.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.688
BARON: Oh, yeah

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.890
BARON: Okay Nemus!

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.091
Let's bring the pain.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.959
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.662
BARON: Bakugan Stand!

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.197
NEMUS: [rising mighty roar]

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.765
NEMUS: [grunt, pain]

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.000
BARON: Whaaaaaah?

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.334
NEMUS: [grunt, pain]

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:23.869
MIRA: What was that?

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.171
DAN: Oh, man.

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:26.739
I sure didn't see that coming.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.841
DRAGO: That guy's lightning fast.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:34.613
BARON: Lucky shot.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.249
Let's try this again.

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.685
NEMUS: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.254
BARON: Ability activate!

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.423
BARON: Haos Force!

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.459
NEMUS: Huuuuuaaaaaaahhhhh!

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.762
AVATAR BARON: Ability activate!

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:54.266
NEMUS: Haaaaarrrrr!

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.668
NEMUS: Stay still, you!

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.803
BARON: I got a bad feeling about this.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:13:59.872
Ability activate.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:02.675
BARON: Sparkly Roa!

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.013
BARON: That should block your attack there buddy.

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:10.015
AVATAR: Ability activate!

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.928
NEMUS: [grunt, pained cry]

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:25.497
BARON: Nemus!

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.666
GAUNTLET: Baron Life force 40%.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.668
DAN: This guy is killer!

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.905
Man, I've never seen any of his moves before.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.707
DRAGO: Yes and his Bakugan

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.943
is unlike anything I've ever seen.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:40.279
BARON: Daaaaaaaaaaaaaannng!

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.648
I can't believe my clone is kicking my butt!

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.650
That makes me so stinkin' mad!

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:46.085
BARON: Gate Card, set!

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.420
BARON: Bakugan stand!

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:49.488
AVATAR: Back at ya!

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:51.056
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.392
BARON: You are driving me crazy!

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:56.161
ACE: Now you know how I feel.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:57.930
BARON: Gate Card, open!

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.065
BARON: Phantasmorphic!

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.572
BARON: Phantasmorphic is a gate card that freezes

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:09.408
the opponent and brings his power level down by a 100!

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:13.078
NEMUS: Now he can't move, and he's mine.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.184
DAN: Baron's pretty chill for how badly he's getting

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:20.653
pounded out there.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.688
SHUN: Maybe they're planning a surprise attack.

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.890
BARON: Time to mix things up...Come Bakugan Trap...

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:28.027
Haos Guardian!

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.935
AVATAR BARON: Ability Activate!

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.640
NEMUS: [pain cry]

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.676
BARON: [grunt, exertion]

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.448
MIRA: He nullified Baron's Gate Card.

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:50.849
NEMUS: Baron!

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.184
BARON: I know, I know!

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.653
Ability activate!

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.923
BARON: Explode!

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.497
BARON: Okay, Nemus my man!

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.533
Time for our most powerful attack!

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.401
Ability activate!

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:12.237
BARON: Sparkly Arrow!

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:15.674
NEMUS: Chew on this!

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.979
GAUNTLET: Avatar Baron life force 60%.

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.249
BARON: [grunt]

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.151
How'd you like that?

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.187
NEMUS: I liked that a lot.

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:33.926
BARON : What was that?

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:37.029
NEMUS: Half time, fireworks show maybe?

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:38.764
AVATAR BARON: Gate Card, set!

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:41.300
AVATAR BARON: Let's heat this up, Bakugan Brawl.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.434
BARON: Ah oh.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.069
Guess we better get our heads back in the game.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:47.506
BARON: Kick it! Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.075
NEMUS: Haaaaaaahhhhh!

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.578
NEMUS: You're not getting any cheap shots

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.046
in on me this time.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.914
BARON: Look.. Look! We got'em.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.650
They're on the run now, Nemus!

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:07.159
GAUNTLET: Ready, Battle Crasher!

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.228
BARON: Hey wait, that's not a Bakugan Trap!

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.763
NEMUS: If not...

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.097
NEMUS: ...then it must be...

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.933
AVATAR BARON: Battle Gear, Boost!

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.117
DAN: Oh dude! He just...

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.353
DRAGO: ...launched some Battle Gear.

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.524
DRAGO: It sounds like a trap.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.392
It's just like the one Helios used.

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.061
MIRA: But how...?

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.128
BARON: Oh No!

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.497
How the heck did he get that thing?

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:48.667
AVATAR BARON: Battle Gear ability, activate!

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.543
MARUCHO: Wow! That's amazing.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.344
His power level just doubled.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:00.546
DAN: Nemus!

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.482
DAN: Run!

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.585
NEMUS: [pained cry]

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:07.686
[grunt]

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:08.954
BARON: Nemus!

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.923
Ability activate!

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.292
BARON: Sparkly Arrow!

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.927
NEMUS: Haaaaaahhhh!

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:21.533
NEMUS: [grunt, pain]

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:22.935
BARON: He's too powerful now.

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.536
Nemus can't keep this up!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.572
BARON: Let's go, Guardian!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.182
BARON: Ability Activate!

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.251
GAUNTLET: Ability Card set.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:42.421
BARON: Tank Bunker!

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.796
BARON: Here we go, Nemus!

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:53.232
Ability activate!

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.071
BARON: Sparkly Arrow!

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.406
NEMUS: With this brilliant light I will purify you

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.208
from all evil!

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.443
NEMUS: Haaaaahh!

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:08.580
DAN: He did it!

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:10.349
BARON: We did it!

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:14.753
NEMUS: What the?

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.322
SHUN: He activated an ability somehow!

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.325
NEMUS: Haaaaah!

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:25.197
BARON: No way!

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.032
ACE: Ah... check it out!

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.801
He nullified Baron and Nemus' abilities.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.540
NEMUS: [pained cry]

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:47.252
[\u266a]

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:53.392
[frightened cries]

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:58.931
[\u266a]

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.198
BARON: Hmmm?

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.466
[gasp]

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:09.408
NEMUS: What kind of a Bakugan was that?

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.512
BARON: Nemus! No!

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:17.316
GAUNTLET: Baron Life force... zero.

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:28.093
[\u266a]

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.395
DAN: Dude! What just happened?

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.264
MARUCHO: I don't understand.

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.999
The battlefield just disappeared.

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:36.501
BARON: That was some display of power.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.837
NEMUS: If that were a real battle, I shudder to think

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.939
what might have happened to me.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:43.609
ACE: Did you catch the equipment he was working with?

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:46.278
And how did they get the Battle Gear, Mira?

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:47.546
MIRA: Maybe the rogue transmission

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:49.381
came from my brother.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.249
DRAGO: The scariest thing of all was that they made

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.785
no attempt to communicate with us directly.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.687
DAN: Who are you guys anyhow?

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.456
And what exactly do you want with us?

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:04.463
[\u266a]

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.635
DAN: I don't understand why Spectra keeps refusing

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:10.902
to team up with us.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.005
Together we could defeat Zenoheld once and for all.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.806
But he's so caught up in his scheme to create

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.009
the Ultimate Bakugan, he can't see that a partnership

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.944
would be a good thing for everyone.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.579
Once he launches his plan he's determined

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:23.081
to have Helios battle Drago ...AGAIN,

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.283
even though Drago has undergone another amazing evolution.

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:27.152
So if he wants a fight he's got one.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.920
We'll finish this once and for all.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.422
This action is so intense, you guys need to

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:32.124
tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.558
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:34.960
Yeaaaaaahhh!
