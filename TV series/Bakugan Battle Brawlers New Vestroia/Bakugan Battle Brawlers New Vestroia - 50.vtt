00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.595
GUS: Come on, Hydron.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.363
Don't you want another shot at the old man after

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.932
he humiliated you?

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.633
Or do you prefer your jail cell.

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.002
PRINCE HYDRON: Just be quiet. I'm not ashamed of anything.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.804
Do you understand that?

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.607
GUS: It's okay. I understand.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.809
You're like a dog who's been beaten by his master

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.344
all his life.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:42.081
Afraid of his own shadow. I feel so sorry for you.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.016
PRINCE HYDRON: What did you say to me?

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.318
GUS: If you stay here, you'll never have to show

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.819
your face again.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.721
I used to despise you, Hydron.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.790
But now I see that instead of anger, I should have

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.593
had pity for you.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:02.568

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.580
your little pop shots?

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:17.316
KEITH/SPECTRA: Hmmpph. Why so defensive?

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.051
That's very telling.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.119

ZENOHELD: When I said I was going to crush you

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:03.396

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:04.530

GUS: That must be Master Spectra outside.

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:17.643
I can feel it. I must get to him.

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:20.513
GUS: It's okay, Hydron. I am here with you.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.115
I know that you're scared, all alone in your cell.

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.084
But just try not to cry. Be brave.

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.086
PRINCE HYDRON: Who does he think he is?

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.554
PRINCE HYDRON: Listen you clown!

You'll be the one who's crying in a minute!

GUS: See, I told you I could get us out of there, Hydron.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.460
PRINCE HYDRON: So you... tricked me into fighting?

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:11.363
GUS: Well, I didn't think asking politely was going to work.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.364
Ciao!

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.700

PRINCE HYDRON: Whoa.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.972
KEITH/SPECTRA: Ha! Activate FARBROS D2!

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:24.410
ZENOHELD: Give up. Even hiding behind your puny Farbas system

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.778
won't save you from the punishment I'm about

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:28.314
to dole out.

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:29.615
KEITH/SPECTRA: [frustrated]

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.953
HELIOS: [pain]

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.490
ZENOHELD: Okay, Farbros. That will be enough.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:38.757
ZENOHELD: I confess...

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:41.060
I was hoping you'd be more of a challenge, Spectra.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:43.863
KEITH/SPECTRA: [chuckle] Zenoheld, you're an even bigger

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.464
fool than your son.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.066
ZENOHELD: What's that?

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.335
KEITH/SPECTRA: Okay, no need to play dead anymore.

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:51.470
Get up, Helios.

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.239
HELIOS: If that's your best, now wonder you need

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:56.876
a weapon like the Alternative, old man.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.444
ZENOHELD: Huh? What the?

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:01.914
How could he have possibly survived such severe attacks?

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.016
KEITH/SPECTRA: With the FARBAS D2 the opponent's

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.418
abilities are completely worthless for a certain

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.887
period of time.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.055
And once those abilities have been activated,

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.558
Helios becomes immune to all of them!

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.393
I will defeat you...

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.862
KEITH/SPECTRA: ...and the alternative will never see

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:18.130
the light of day.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.732

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:22.935

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.761
Alternative's light ray will swallow up everything

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:19.531
in its path. [maniacal laughter]

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:22.367
[\u266a]

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.502
HELIOS: Huh?

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:24.736
KEITH/SPECTRA: What is it, Helios?

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.340
KEITH/SPECTRA: What?

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:30.576
[\u266a]

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.779
[explosion]

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.414
[\u266a]

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.516
KEITH/SPECTRA: [gasp]

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:41.687
GUS: What could cause such...destruction?

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.758
ZENOHELD: [maniacal laughter]

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.828
You can't hide for long, Spectra!

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:55.400
[maniacal laughter]

00:18:55.434 --> 00:19:05.477
[explosion sounds]

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:13.619
[explosion sounds]

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:27.599
[\u266a]

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:28.734
GUS: [gasp]

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.168
HELIOS: Is that what I think it is?

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:32.971
KEITH/SPECTRA: Yes, it's...the Alternative.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.574
[\u266a]

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:54.626
PROFESSOR CLAY: [chuckle] That was merely a warm up.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.197
Imagine their faces when we switch to full power.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.032
ZENOHELD: I want to see...more, Clay!

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.400
PROFESSOR CLAY: Yes!

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:11.476
[\u266a]

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:21.119
[\u266a]

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:30.429
ZENOHELD: [chuckles] At last, my ultimate reign of the

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:33.165
dimensions will finally begin!

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:35.867
GUS: I can't believe the Alternative is real now!

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.970
KEITH/SPECTRA: Quick! Let's go, Gus!

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:40.372
GUS: Yes! Right behind you.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:46.011
[\u266a]

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.713
PROFESSOR CLAY: We've done it King Zenoheld.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.982
ZENOHELD: Yes indeed we have, Professor Clay.

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:54.219
And now we will move forward to our next and final phase.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:59.191
ZENOHELD: Conquering every world in existence, one by one.

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:06.031
[maniacal laughter]

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:09.468
KEITH/SPECTRA: The Alternative is even more

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.637
monstrous and terrifying in person.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.171
The fact that it can blow an entire planet to

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:15.574
smithereens is unbelievable.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.543
A weapon of unparalleled strength, I have no idea

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.078
how we're going to defeat it.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.880
KEITH/SPECTRA: Luckily the other Brawlers have shown

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.215
up and are ready for battle.

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:25.050
It's going to take all of our strength and skill to

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.351
pull this off.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.819
But we're ready!

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.288
KEITH/SPECTRA: This is going to be the battle of all battles.

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:33.158
You definitely need to tune in to check it out.

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:35.260
KEITH/SPECTRA: Time to finish this, Helios.

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:36.428
KEITH/SPECTRA: Let's go!

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:47.539
[\u266a]

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:57.182
