WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.142
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.778
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on the Drago

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.981
and I returning to free our friends.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.617
Time to get...serious!

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.753
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.521
Resistance!

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.957
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.261
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.295
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.597
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.133
Bakugan...Brawl!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:45.578
[\u266a]

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:55.221
[\u266a]

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.934
Welcome back!

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.403
We're reporting live on planet Earth at the home...

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.873
...of one of the six master Bakugan Brawlers.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.976
I am actually standing in Runo's caf\u00e9!

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.914
Aaaaah...You can feel the excitement in the air.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.550
Does anyone know if there's an off switch on that guy?

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.052
You're my favourite make-believe host.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.153
What's this?

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:30.523
An exclusive photo of little baby Runo!

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.960
Aaaaaaaaawwwwww!

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.329
Whooooza cute baby?

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.497
[hugging sounds]

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.766
Looking at that sweet, innocent face...Who could

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.035
have predicted the fierce warrior this girl would

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.703
grow up to become?

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.804
No one, that's who.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.072
It's just too cool!

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.208
You know, something's not right with that boy.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.343
Come on...I think he's a sweetie.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.847
Whaaaaat? Baron!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.417
We interrupt this special report...to bring you live

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.320
coverage of me stuffing Baron into the nearest

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.355
garbage can.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.526
Whoa, Baron...I'd lay low around Runo for a while.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.396
Dan's learned the hard way not to tease Runo.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.798
Dan's afraid of Runo.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.333
That's so not true.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.235
Ok...Whatever Dan.

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:16.803
[laughter]

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.272
Why, Keith?

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.175
A promise is a promise.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.311
This will prove I'm a friend to the Bakugan...

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.614
It is you...Keith!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.649
But why?

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.751
The others must never know.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.053
Mira...

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.121
Order's up.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.256
Table Three!

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.657
It's all yours, Runo.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.791
I got it.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:39.792
Hey Runo!

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.927
Let me help you with that!

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.763
I bet I'd be a totally great waiter! Watch.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.332
I'll balance this plate on my head!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.035
No thanks, Baron...I've cleaned up enough of your

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.170
spills today.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:53.339
Why don't you go outside and sweep up the sidewalk?

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:57.310
Me? Sweep your stoop? Awesome!

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.979
[pleased with self laugh]

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.650
[\u266a]

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.686
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Voices in the Night\"

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.623
Talk later...I should have finished my break like,

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.091
an hour ago.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.960
You mean you work here too?

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.228
Yup!

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.497
I've been staying with Runo and her parents for a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.934
while...So I figure the least I can do is...

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.203
put on an apron and help.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:27.473
Well then, I should pitch in too, shouldn't I?

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.909
May I have please have one of those, Julie?

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.544
You want an...apron?

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:32.745
Yes please?

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.148
It'll help take my mind off Keith.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.586
Ummmm...Anyone need help?

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.688
Suuuure!

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.389
Uh, I think that's yours.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.292
Hey there Mira!

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.428
Are my burger and fries ready yet?

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:50.263
We've been waiting. Sorry.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.364
Curly fries!

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.465
Mira!

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.000
Pizza!

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.268
Mira, over here!

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.537
Hello! I'm working too!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.671
Come on.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.106
Don't be such a crankypants, Runo...

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.609
You're still the third prettiest waitress.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.778
I wonder how Marucho, Ace and Shun are doing back in

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.847
New Vestroia?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.749
Oh My back!

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:14.721
[\u266a]

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.222
This can't be right.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.958
The Beta and Delta Dimension Controllers are

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.794
growing more and more powerful.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.363
What's going on?

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.066
Drago is New Vestroia's Perfect Core, and his

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.802
power is what keeps the planet stable...With him

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:32.038
gone, they're getting stronger and stronger.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.374
That's not good!

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:37.277
We gotta move fast or Alpha City New Vestroia

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.479
will reconnect with the other Controllers and

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.214
we'll be back where we started.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:43.850
That's gonna be a big job for just the three of us.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.953
The Bakugan are counting on us...We have to find a

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:51.391
way to get into Beta City and destroy that controller.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.294
No matter what happens, Dan and Mira would want us

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.962
to keep going.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.998
Mira.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.299
Whoooaaahh!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.069
Hey! Can't a Bakugan get some sleep around here?

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.538
Sorry. My bad.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.208
Hmmph.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.444
What's your rush, you fools?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.545
Peekaboo.

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:17.250
Someone's watching you.... Mylene, are you there?

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:18.418
Of course.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.853
What's left of the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance is

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.222
heading your way.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:25.024
You know what must be done.

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.025
So do it.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.326
Why yes, sire.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.195
I won't have you making the same mistake as last

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.799
time...Do not let them anywhere near Beta City.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.867
I understand, your highness.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.273
During Spectra's absence, Mylene will deal with the

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:43.910
Resistance...And when my rebellious servant

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:46.646
returns, he'll find his Vexos have a new leader.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:47.747
Blaaahh!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.917
I'm tired of this game...Just let me handle

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.151
the Resistance.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.419
Get over yourself.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.787
You're far too reckless...

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.523
We must plan carefully.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:06:00.526
You don't think I could take those noobs?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.496
I'm saying we must leave nothing to chance.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.399
The odds will be better if we can confuse them first.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.068
If we separate them and take them down one by one,

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:11.604
they won't be able to use teamwork.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.740
Good idea...That's how they turned the tables on

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.342
Lync and me in the tournament last time.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.744
Get off it!

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:21.147
Who died and made Mylene leader of the Vexos?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.150
Be quiet and do as you're told, Shadow Prove...I've

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.486
got a special part for you.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:27.520
Look Mylene.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.855
The trailer is stopping.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:36.162
How perfect...Now the plan begins.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.302
[sigh]

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.604
Marucho, wake up.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:45.738
You're having a nightmare.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:49.976
...I'm sorry, Elfin...I'm totally stressing out.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.312
I dreamt I had to save the Bakugan all by myself but

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.681
then I forgot you in my other jacket.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.784
Don't worry, Marucho.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.019
I won't let you leave me behind.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.687
I guess you're right, Elfin.

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.856
It was only a dream, but I'd sure feel a whole lot

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.092
better if Dan and Mira were here.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.260
Man, I'm beat.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.162
I should probably be conserving energy but I

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.497
just can't get to sleep...I guess I'm just

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.499
worried about the others...

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.468
But especially...

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.405
...Mira...I really hope you're okay.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:20.506
Hurry back, Dan.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.142
We can't do it without you.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:27.880
...Marucho...help me...Marucho!

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.917
...What was that?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.918
...Dan?

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:36.489
Shun...Marucho...I can't hold on...

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.024
Help me, Ace!

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.358
Please!

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.127
What? Mira?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.529
Okay...This is really freaking me out.

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.798
Have you forgotten my voice already?

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.568
Get moving and help me!

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.503
Sorry Dan, but what happened?

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.738
Where are you?

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.841
Dude, you really are slow, aren't you?

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:56.609
I'm in between dimensions.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.711
I tried to get back to New Vestroia but I'm stuck in

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.913
the Dimensional Gate.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:04.283
You're in the Dimensional Gate? Over there?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.420
Don't worry Dan. Hang on. I'm coming for you!

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.788
Wait, Marucho!

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.122
But Dan is in trouble!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.724
We've got to get to him, Shun!

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:12.992
Let go of my arm!

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.894
Yeah, Shun! Don't you care what happens to me?

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.996
I thought you were my friend!

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.632
I am! Is that really you, Dan?

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.601
Marucho, hurry!

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.436
I'm coming, Dan!

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:24.704
Marucho!

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:26.005
I'll save you!

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.774
It's just a little wind.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.476
I can do this.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.245
I should have worn a scarf...

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.614
That's it, keep going, Marucho!

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:38.551
What are ya waiting for, Christmas?

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:43.956
[struggling/breathless effort]

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.925
Marucho!

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.094
I'm coming, Mira!

[staggering/effort]

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.565
Hang on, I'm almost there!

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.833
Hurry up, Ace!

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.501
Don't you care?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.569
Mira!

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.570
Ace?

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.671
Keep going, Ace.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:08:59.805
I can't hold on...

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.207
You've got to hurry!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.042
Help me Ace!

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.011
I need yoooou!

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.380
[evil laugh]

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.582
This is way too hilarious!

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.884
Good...Then keep it up.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.386
Marucho!

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.254
You're the only one who can save me,

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.924
Marooooochoooo!

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.492
Seriously, I'm so scared!

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:20.860
I'm going to cry!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.529
Waa-waaahhhh!

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.364
Marucho! Wait!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.500
I'm coming, Dan!

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.336
No! Don't go in! It's a trap, Marucho!

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:32.872
Oh no!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.241
Mira!

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.780
That's just great.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.950
We'll be right back with more Bakugan...I hope.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.319
[\u266a]

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.621
[triumphant chuckle] Those pathetic fools

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.195
[fearful breathing]

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:57.296
[gasp]

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.531
...What?

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.299
Where am I?

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.635
Heeeeeeeeelp!

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.470
That was so awesome.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.872
Thanks for lunch Mr. and Mrs. Misaki.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.909
And for the experience waitressing...Who knows, I

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.078
might come back for a job.

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:15.047
Yeah sure Mira...any time.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.216
What Runo means to say...is that you would

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:19.919
need more training to work at the caf\u00e9.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.121
But as the best waitress in town I'll be happy to

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.090
teach you everything I know.

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.458
Don't be so modest, Julie.

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:27.193
Tell us how you really feel.

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:29.462
Uh...just kidding.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:30.730
[laugh]

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:33.766
You kids are welcome any time you're on the planet.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.768
Thanks...You're the best.

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.837
Shall we get going?

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.107
And now...for the moment I've been waiting for all

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.309
my life...

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.379
The next stop Dan's house...You can't imagine

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.014
how stoked I am.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.248
Come on!

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.549
Ow!

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.051
Get a grip, Baron! It's the other way!

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.954
[indulgent laugh]

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.856
Better get going.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.891
Thanks again.

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:01.827
Come back and work my shift any time!

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:05.831
It's good to see you having fun again.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:19.945
I'm so glad you were able to drop by for a visit, Ace.

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.447
Mylene

[dismissive grunt]

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.550
So that was an imposter's voice and not Mira's.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.419
I should have known it was a trap!

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.687
It was so moving...Watching you come

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.990
running for your precious Mira.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.558
Don't you even say her name!

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:35.461
Suits me...You're never going to see her again

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.463
anyway...When I'm through with you, there'll be

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.732
nothing left.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.801
That's what you think.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.869
Gauntlet Activated.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.606

Elico Power Level 500.

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.400
His power level...is off the chain.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:17.636
It seems unfair to unleash my powers on such a tiny

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.140
weakling.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.575
...Percival!

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.643
We'll set him straight Ace!

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:27.313
Let's show them how it's done!

Hmmph. Just a little dust storm.

Laugh it up, Elico.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.602
But this ability will slash your Power Level by

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.771
300 points.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.508

stayed underground!

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:51.697
Too late...The attribute change stops your

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.998
abilities cold.

How does it feel to fight

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:59.505
for such a pitiful Brawler, Percival?

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:01.974
Come a little closer and I'll show you...

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.543
Hang in there, Percival!

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.912

Things are never what they seem.

He still has his Aquos powers?

Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.335
Acurus allows Subterra Elicos to use any

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.237
attribute's powers on command.

I'm okay...I can still brawl.

Are you sure?

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.996
We can't give up, Ace.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.498
For the Bakugan.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:34.333
And for Mira!

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.434
You're right.

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.971
This the moment you've all been waiting for!

The final round of the Bakugan Battle Tournament!

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:48.113
Who will become the New Vestroia Destroyah?

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.683
Are you the one they call Ace?

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.418
Yeah.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:55.220
Okay, you dragged me out to the middle of nowhere

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:59.091
and so far all I know is your name is Mira.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.926
You'll find out more if you can beat me in a

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.861
brawl...Here's your gauntlet...

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:09.401
Yeah right...What makes you think I'd battle you?

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.737
Word on the street is you're an even stronger

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.139
brawler than most of the Vexos but you refuse to

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.409
enter the Tournaments...Why is that?

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:20.612
Those tournaments are so bogus...Besides I don't

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:23.549
play well with others...I battle alone.

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.683
Always have.

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.086
What if I told you I want you on my team?

Your team?

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:31.190
Why yes...I'm looking for the strongest Brawlers to

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:33.826
help me free the Bakugan...Join the Bakugan

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:37.329
Free them?

I don't get it.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.866

how good you are.

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.608
I'm all right!

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.443
Let's go again.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:54.380
I'm good to go...Ready?

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.281
[\u266a]

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.649
Gate Card...Set!

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:01.954
[\u266a]

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.223
This time we'll show them no mercy

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.892
Percival...Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.894
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.629
[ready for battle grunt]

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:15.067
How soon they forget...Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.503
Darkus Elico!

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.139
Gate Card...Open!

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:23.475
Darkus Reactor!

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.111
Percival increase 200.

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.148
...It won't help you...Elico! Let's go!

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.817
Attribute Change!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.951
Prepare yourself!

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:37.556
[\u266a]

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:40.225
Behold Haos Elico!

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.727
Can't you make up your mind?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.862
I will shine my light...And reveal your

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.564
weakness!

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:48.767
Haos Ability Activate!

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.868
Mithran Judge!

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:53.372
[\u266a]

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.641
[blinded/frustrated roar]

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:59.344
It's time you saw the light.

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:02.714
[\u266a]

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.249
Calculating Power Levels

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:05.317
Enough!

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.652
I agree!

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:10.122
Mithran Judge prevents you from activating any of

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.723
Percival's abilities.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:12.925
That's not fair!

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.494
Little man...You're no match for us.

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:27.005
Percival!

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.877
I gotta change this up.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.947
You've only got 150 points left on your life gauge

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.016
yet you still resist...Why continue to brawl when

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.052
you're completely outmatched?

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:42.287
Because I made a promise!

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:45.157
The moment I found out the truth about the Bakugan!

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:52.698
[panting/exhausted]

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:55.601
I...can't believe it... I've never lost before...

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.840
Welcome to the resistance, Ace.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:02.975
[angry slapping]

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:05.010
I never said I'd join your team.

00:19:05.043 --> 00:19:08.347
That's okay. I decided for you...

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.283
Ace, meet Darkus Percival...starting today,

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.452
he'll be your new partner.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:16.121
He's my partner?

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.357
You battle with courage, Ace.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.192
Get out! A talking Bakugan?

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.660
Hey, what is this?

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.195
You can hear him too?

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.897
Then I picked the right brawler.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.000
Welcome to the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.469
I'll never give up!

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.005
I gave my word to save the Bakugan and I won't rest

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:34.439
until they're free!

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.607
How moving.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.042
I almost want to cry...

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:39.344
Gate Card open!

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:41.013
It's time to man it up.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.549
Bakugan...Brawl!

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.150
I'm on it!

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:49.521
The joke's on you, Mylene...Bakugan...Brawl!

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.790
Percival Stand!

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.892

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.429
Darkus Thunder!

[lightning]

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:10.542
[\u266a]

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:14.846
You think you're so clever...

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.782
But you're really not...

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.383
Ability Card Set.

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.851
Ability Activate.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.220
Trick World!

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.423
Now tell me which way's up!

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.725
Percival Power Level 100.

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:28.226
No way!

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.229
Some advice...I'd take a very, very deep breath if

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:32.598
I were you.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:39.504
[\u266a]

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:44.142
[gurgling struggling]

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:54.219
[\u266a]

00:20:54.219 --> 00:21:00.559
[\u266a]

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.494
That's one down...

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.863
Their nightmare has just begun...

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.500
[\u266a]

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:09.768
Okay!

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.503
It's bad enough I'm in the middle of a desert and I

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.505
fall into quick sand...

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:15.807
But then Volt shows up for a duel in the dunes and

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.443
Elfin and I have to show him who's boss.

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:20.646
Okay, so Volt is boss.

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:23.248
But we're not going to give up that easy.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.418
We're going to bounce back and show those Vexos who

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:27.819
brings the best brawl!

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.756
Go kung fu Elfin!

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.258
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.593
Trust me.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.762
You do not want to miss the next scorcher, Brawler buddies!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:46.838
