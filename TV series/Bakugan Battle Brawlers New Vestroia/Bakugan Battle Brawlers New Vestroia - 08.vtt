WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.741
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.709
were on a mission to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.745
So we joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:12.846
Resistance.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.582
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.685
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.554
Every battle makes us stronger and brings us

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.757
closer to our goal.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.725
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.061
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.729
How hard can that be?

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.232
We're ready to roll...

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.135
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.271
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.641
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.643
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:44.911
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.679
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.047
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.916
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.284
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.353
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:57.190
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.959
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.029
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.297
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:10.236
[wild cheering]

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.673
Welcome Brawlers, to today's Bakugan Battle Tournament.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.742
We're counting down the seconds to the first throw.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.911
Who's ready to beat the heat and who will be smacked down

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.180
in cold defeat?

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.514
Go, Pyrus Verias!

Hey... No fair!

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.625
ANNOUNCER: Oooh, burnnnnn!

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.193
But that's the way the Bakugan rolls.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:10.497
These mysterious, masked players pack a serious punch...

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.232
They're the team on everyone's lips...

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.101
the Bakugan Brawlers!

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.109
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"What's The Plan?\"

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:27.647
[ecstatic cheering]

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.649
The Bakugan Brawlers?

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:31.117
I've never heard of them.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.253
Yeah, but they sure know how to brawl.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.321
They'll never beat the Vexos, though.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.992
[wincing pain] This is killin' me...

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.860
I should be out there battling...

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.829
I can't even bear to watch this.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.497
Stay focused Dan.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.566
You're important to the plan.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.601
Why do they get all the fun?

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.937
Uh, Master Dan?

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.272
Look.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.375
Unbelievable.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.243
The Dimension Controller...

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.344
The key...

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.113
to our mission.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.749
SHUN: I stole these diagrams the last time I snuck

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.784
into the city.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:08.188
According to this, the power generated from the Bakugan

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:12.225
Battles is absorbed inside the arena then transmitted

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:16.029
to the outside world through the Controller.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.398
So... what's the point of that?

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.099
There's an awful lot of power generated

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.402
by Bakugan battles.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.437
And if that power isn't released,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.473
the Controller would get overloaded.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.343
So if the Bakugan battles still feed power

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.778
into the Controller...

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.912
Exactly...

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.081
And if we can block the transmission...

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.516
right here...

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.785
the power will back up, building and building...

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.254
Until the pressure becomes too much...

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.289
Then the Controller will implode.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.526
Then we must take advantage of the upcoming tournaments.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.761
Really?... That's now!

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.764
ANNOUNCER: The Battle of the Bakugan is about to begin!

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.267
Will all competitors please register.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.271
Don't miss your chance to brawl with the best!

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.107
Okay, everyone, we need to move fast...

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.543
We'll have to break up into two teams...

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.179
Two people will battle together in the tournament.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.714
And the rest of us...

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.350
will sneak inside and find the Controller.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.751
I call the battle...

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.753
Drago and I will fight for the Resistance.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.989
No fair! I want to fight!

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.291
You always get the battles, Master Dan.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:22.662
[cross-talk, arguing]

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.930
That is enough!

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.832
Be quiet!

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.868
We'll draw numbers to decide.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.041
[Dan yells]

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.342
You're right...

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.810
I lost the draw...

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.779
But those two are one odd match up.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:40.980
I agree.

That's it...

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.993
Now I'll block you with Darkus Anti-ability.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:57.497
Continuos Dance, Phoenix Position!

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.032

What are you butting into my fight for?

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.680
You needed my help whether you'll admit it or not.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:14.847
Back off!

Once again the battle goes to the Bakugan Brawlers!

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.925
I could have finished them off faster,

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.060
if you'd stayed out of my way...

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:02.528
Get the hint?

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.597
I saved your Bakugan and you know it.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.598
What? !

They can destroy the Controller...

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.616
Let me go! Get a grip, Master Dan.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.551
You're letting everyone know our plan!

You think so?

But I haven't even tried it yet...

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.848
the Masked Brawler is disqualified for losing

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.850
control of his Bakugan.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:40.887
[horrified scream reax]

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.655
That's gotta hurt.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.357
You can say that again.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.898
MARUCHO: I have totally embarrassed myself...

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.400
for a noble cause.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:58.237
Wow, you lost without even getting a chance to fight.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.772
That's a first.

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:04.377
Thank you, Elfin.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.385
Now it's time for step two.

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.623
Mister! Mister! Come quick!

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.259
I just saw someone really suspicious back there.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.727
I think it was a member of the Bakugan

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.362
Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.064
Thanks kid!

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.732
[sigh of relief]

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.970
[beeping]

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.172
Coast is clear, everybody.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.807
Thanks, good work Marucho.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.209
That was an amazing performance

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.078
in the arena earlier, Marucho...

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.347
Thanks for getting us inside, Baron.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.182
I definitely owe you for that one.

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:46.752
I hacked into their systems and downloaded the floor plans.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.988
[frustration reax] Oops.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.557
We must stay focused.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.959
[crowd cheering]

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:56.929
Let's get going.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.197
Don't worry, Brawlers.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.665
It's in the bag.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.269
Just in time.

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.905
Now get set for some serious brawling!

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.641
ANNOUNCER: We've got special superstars

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.809
in our audience today!

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.244
Spectra and his mighty Vexos have arrived!

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.280
The merciless Mylene!

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.616
The savage Shadow!

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.584
The relentless Gus!

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:21.887
And the supreme Spectra!

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.623
[cheering]

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:27.460
[grunt] What's so great about Vexos?

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.729
We'll show this crowd who's best.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:30.963
Forget about them.

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.733
It's a waste of time.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.168
Just stick to the plan.

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:40.106
[annoyed grunt] Shun thinks he's so cool.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.443
DRAGO: There are more guards than we expected.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.747
Whenever the Vexos show up security is super tight.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.948
Should we turn back?

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:50.683
No, we can't stop now.

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:51.984
This is our chance....

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.619
Hey! What are you doing here?

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.254
How did you get in here?

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.123
Authorized personal... only

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.891
Show us your ID cards.

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.793
We... lost our ID cards.

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.895
We left them in our other pants.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.430
[growling]

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.901
[giggle/squeal] Oh please tell

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:13.239
the Vexos their number one fans are here!

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.108
Ohmygosh you guys!

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:18.711
They're really here, aren't they!

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.212
Can you get us an autograph?

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.414
Or maybe they'll sign my jacket!

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:22.448
The Vexos totally rock!

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.150
Just a bunch of fans.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.851
They should just get a life.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.321
[sigh of relief]...

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.356
Wow...

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.091
That was quick thinking Mira.

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.526
You're such a fangirl...

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.561
Vexos totally rock!

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:36.862
Very funny.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.064
[laughs]

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.799
[sneering laugh]

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.935
Did you see the fans go crazy when they introduced me?

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.003
Hah!

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.704
Whatever.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.140
We can leave the challengers to Lync and Volt.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:49.909
I'm going back to Beta City.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.812
Maybe I'll keep you company... Huh?...Huh?

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:54.847
Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm?

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.984
The Vexos.

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.286
Stay cool, Dan.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:01.854
Do you have anything to report?

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.155
Nothing unusual...

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:05.624
A few of your fans snuck backstage though.

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.493
Really... what fans?

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:08.828
Should I check on it?

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.563
Don't bother...

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.298
It's nothing...

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.468
You corner your opponent but for some

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:18.104
reason you lose focus on the final attack.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.773
THINKING: That's exactly what Keith does!

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.475
So Spectra's here?

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:24.176
I can't pass up that opportunity.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.711
I'm going to challenge him!

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:27.012
[worried reax]

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.426
Way... to... go... Dan!

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:41.727
Keep it together!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.429
If we get caught now, it's over!

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.898
And I for one do not want to get caught.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.602
Okay, I'm sorry!

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.947
It appears some mice have snuck into the arena.

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.449
Who cares about mice?

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.851
This arena and city are your problem...

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.320
It's time to clean house.

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.089
It's time to clean house.

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.924
Mouse problem?

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.792
What's he talking about?

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.362
How should I know?

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:19.231
The Tag Team event has reached the semi-finals!

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.934
This match will decide who will face off against Master

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.104
Brawlers Lync and Volt in the final round!

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:28.007
Can the Dark Angels team of Annie and Vanessa cruise to

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.777
victory over the upstart Bakugan Brawlers?

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.778
Well, duuuh.

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:33.913
Of course we will.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.848
Like taking candy from a baby!

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.216
Some free advice...

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:39.819
If you want to win stay out of my way.

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:40.920
Not my style...

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.522
You'd know that if you paid more attention.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.891
Are all you humans this annoying or did you take

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:47.660
special charm lessons?

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:50.229
If you'd stop talking and start Brawling this would

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.697
all be over by now.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.500
[cheering]

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.869
Let the Battle begin!

00:13:56.902 --> 00:14:00.839
Gate Card... Set!

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.043
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.344
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.213
Haos Anchorsaur!

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.282
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.051
Bakugan Stand!

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:15.688
Haos Hammersaur!

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.590
Gate Card Open...

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.458
Haos Reactor!

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:21.093
GAUNTLET: Hammersaur and Anchorsaur,

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:24.063
Power Level increase, 100 each.

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:26.165
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.767
Stand Darkus Percival!

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.706
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.574
Stand, Ventus Ingram!

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.246
[confident battle yell]

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.882
Our thunderous semi-final match up...

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.117
is off to a roaring start!

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.121
Hiya!

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.223
[GROWL]

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.594
What are you looking at?

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:58.397
Percival!

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.266
I'll take care of them!

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:05.504
Ingram!

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.773
BOTH: Sis-tahs!

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.141
Let's see how you feel...

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:10.409
after this...

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.944
Ability Activate!

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.312
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:14.880
Darkus Driver!

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.782
Ability Activate!

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.817
Wind Power, Soaring Strike!

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:22.588
BOTH: Ability Activate.

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:24.156
Spark Protection!

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:25.958
And Mirror Ghost!

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:31.830
[attack cry]

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:34.633
[laugh reax]

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.001
How could I miss?

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.870
I never miss!

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:39.571
Look out!

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.076
Our life points! No!

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.880
Oh great... Way to go.

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:50.916
Right. Who's side are you on, anyway?

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.184
You blame me?!

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:53.952
ANNOUNCER: What a combination!

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:55.587
Spark Protection reflected the opponent's ability

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.858
and Mirror Ghost made Hammersaur untouchable!

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.461
Those abilities are unique to each Bakugan.

00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:05.230
A flawless display of skill and power from the Dark

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:07.700
Angels as they drive to victory!

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:09.535
BOTH: All right!

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:12.771
DAN: I hope that's good cheering.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.239
Look.

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.240
Huh...

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.942
I'd say it's bad cheering.

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.878
What are those guys doing out there?

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:20.913
[worried reax]

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:23.082
Stop stalling and start brawling.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.650
Just give up...

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.085
You guys are over.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.519
But don't feel bad...

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:31.623
You fashion rejects aren't worthy of fighting the Vexos.

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.327
[laugh] Once we win, we'll become the newest

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.762
Vexos members.

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:40.532
Then we'll become the newest superstars of New Vestroia!

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.301
Got it all planned out, huh?

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.571
It's a little early for a victory parade...

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.172
'Cause you're about to lose.

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:49.108
I hear a bug buzzing...

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:50.676
Let's squash it...

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:53.145
SHUN: I don't think so, ladies.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:56.515
We're not here to play games with wannabe Bakugan Stars.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:57.950
We've got a job to do.

00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.385
We hate to burst your bubble...

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:00.452
But the winners...

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.888
BOTH: ...are us!

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.823
We finally agree on something.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.393
[agreement grunt]

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.094
Gate Card Set!

00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:10.796
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:15.067
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.336
Ingram!

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.171
They're asking for it!

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.472
They sure are!

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.875
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:26.445
[threatening roar]

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.614
I'll create a distraction...

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:30.949
Then you can take them down, okay?

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.652
You mean we have an actual plan this time?

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:34.953
Okay.

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:35.954
[amused reax]

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.456
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:39.792
Percival Stand!

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.196
Ability Activate!

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.131
Power Eraser!

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.501
[pain reax] I can't move!

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.603
Neither can I!

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.672
Power Eraser reduces the opponent's Power Level

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.774
by 300!

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.509
It's another one of Anchorsaur's unique...

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.710
abilities

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.879
Bakugan with a power level of less than 300

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.482
are completely incapacitated.

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:05.250
You can give up any time now.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:06.685
[struggling/pain reax]

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:07.886
As if...

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.988
Gate Card... Open!

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.723
Ventus Reactor!

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.495
SHUN: That will raise the Power Level...

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:21.266
and now.. Ability Activate, Shadow Echo!

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.906
Where'd he go?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.174
He just disappeared.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.376
MARUCHO: Shadow Echo reduces an opponent's Power Level

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.878
by 200 apiece!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:35.481
It's a special ability only Ingram can use.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.416
This match isn't over yet!

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.489
Gotcha!

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:44.690
Hey!

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:45.824
Anchorsaur!

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.392
Wake up and pay attention!

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:48.894
Ability Activate!

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.295
Flash Bow!

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.935
BOTH: Hammersaur!

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.070
ANNOUNCER: Oh yeah!

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.806
Flash Bow takes out Hammersaur's Power Eraser.

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.407
Percival is free!

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.277
The Dark Angels are beating themselves!

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.012
What's with you, Vanessa!

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.180
Be quiet!

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.082
[smug laugh]... We've got them now...

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:12.117
Ability Activate!

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.552
Tri Gunner!

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.155
With Power Level this high...

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.559
...I'm taking your Anchorsaur!

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:21.560
What?

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:23.529
No way!

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:27.733
Anchorsaur goes down hard!

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.168
Leaving Annie's Life Gauge at zero

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:32.838
and the Battle Brawlers claiming Anchorsaur!

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:36.808
Man! He disappeared again!

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:40.078
[wary, angry grumble]

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.883
He's there... In the shadow!

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.852
Pound him!

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.056
You underestimated us.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:52.691
You haven't won yet!

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.428
Come on out, Ingram!

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.030
Ability Activate!

00:19:58.063 --> 00:20:01.133
Continuous Dance, Phoenix Position!

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.136
Look at him go.

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:06.939
I've never seen Points drop so fast!

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.442
No fair! Two against one!

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:13.011
ANNOUNCER: The Battle Brawlers take Hammersaur too!

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.279
[tantrum like cry]

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:15.981
ANNOUNCER: Vanessa's lost it!

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.917
The Dark Angels are gone, gone, gone!

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:22.087
The Battle Brawlers come from behind to win the round!

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.556
They will now face the Vexos Tag Team champs,

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.993
Lync and Volt in the finals!

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.428
Yeah!

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.564
You're so much like Dan, it's hilarious.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.732
[consider reax] What do you mean?

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.067
You think I'm a dimwit?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.501
Maybe.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.703
[amused reax]

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.571
You think you're so cool.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.039
[amused reax]

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.808
I knew they could do it!

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:44.610
And now it's our turn....

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:45.811
Right!

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:53.118
[happy laughter]

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.787
I think we've found Spectra's pesky mice.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.155
Those Battle Brawlers guys?

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.991
They don't look so tough.

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.993
[laughter]

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.427
Don't you mean...

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:05.364
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance?

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.303
Hey Brawlers.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.404
Shun here.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.206
Our plan to get to the finals of the tournament

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:15.607
worked perfectly!

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.844
But now we have to face two of the Vexos' top Brawlers,

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.679
Lync and Volt.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.015
We'll have to toy with them for a while to give Dan and

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:25.817
the others time to sneak past security.

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.686
But the Dimension Controller is better guarded

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.187
than we thought.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.490
I'm counting on Dan to find a way through.

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:34.226
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.528
You definitely don't want to miss this!

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:37.562
No way.
