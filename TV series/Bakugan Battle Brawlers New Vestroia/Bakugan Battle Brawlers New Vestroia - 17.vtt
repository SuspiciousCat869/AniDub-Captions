00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.842
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.544
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.681
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.350
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.221
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.790
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.994
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.095
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.463
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:35.068
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:45.145
[\u266a]

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:54.788
[\u266a]

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.002
[frustrated, angry roar]

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.441
[roar]

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.875
Drago...

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.114
[frustrated angry roar]

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.886
Drago!

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.924
[\u266a]

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:34.494
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Dude, Where's My Bakugan?\"

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.168
Hi!

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.173
Oh... Are you alright?

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.975
Must have been some nightmare.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.678
You interrupted my beauty sleep.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:53.780
I thought we were being attacked.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.415
Don't scare us like that again.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.783
Master Dan...

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:59.118
we all know that it hasn't been that easy since you

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.753
lost Drago.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.725
I was hoping that was just a bad dream.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.893
[sad gasp]

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.263
I can't believe Drago is really gone.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.732
[small sob]

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.468
You'll get him back, Dan...

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.904
Please, you can't give up.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.339
[amused snort]

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.709
There's no time to feel sorry for myself...

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.412
I've got to start training hard so I'm primed for a rematch.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.447
Right!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.615
Oooh! Right!

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.450
Shake it off and get back out there.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.554
Well, if you're gonna get training then I better get

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.089
cooking.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.259
Hope you like it!

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.127
Looks delicious!

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.001
Let's dig in!

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:52.839
[gobbling noises]

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.141
If I'm gonna train as hard as Master Dan then I'm

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.211
gonna eat as hard as Master Dan.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:03.516
[gobbling noises]

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.853
It's good to see Dan's got his appetite back...

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.454
He seems like his old, perky

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.557
self again.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.125
Yeah...

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.826
Weird. I never thought Dan would be able to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.296
bounce back without Drago.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.031
But he's looking good!

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:22.869
[gulp and munching food]

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.804
[closed mouth depressed sigh]

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.541
It's not working.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.611
This is all my fault.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.413
Drago's gone.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.448
Dan...

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.417
You shouldn't blame yourself.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.853
Drago wouldn't want you to.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.488
I don't think he hears us.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.927
Master Dan?

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.196
Hello? Earth to Dan.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.564
[long, sad sigh]

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.534
Wow, Master Dan really must be messed up.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.903
You know, Julie,

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.339
Dan's been apart from Drago before but...

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.774
It's never affected him this bad.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:04.444
Drago is a part of him.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.812
It's like he's lost

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.146
all hope...

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.149
We've got to figure out a way to help Dan snap out of it.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.051
Drago needs him more than ever.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.359
Dan? I'm... so sorry.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.693
Come on, girls...

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.363
You can't cheer him up with frowns.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.398
Right.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.104
I feel like a traitor.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:34.841
My brother is the one who's causing all this misery.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:39.712
The dragonoid is now mine, Gus.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.582
And yet I feel strangely unsatisfied.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:43.850
But, Master...

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.419
now you can complete your plan to build the most

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.555
powerful hybrid Bakugan ever created!

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.159
Then you and I will remake New Vestroia in or own image.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:56.262
[amused chuckle]

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.434
As you can see, Prince Hydron, now that the

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.970
dragonoid has gone, the Dimension Controllers'

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:06.205
power is increasing once again.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.076
It even covers the area the destroyed Alpha

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:13.579
Controller left unprotected.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.582
Now if we can close the Gate before the rest of the

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.686
Battle Brawlers' Resistance returns from Earth...

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.389
...there will be no one left to interfere with our plans.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.725
Have you forgotten about Spectra and Gus?

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.860
They haven't come back yet, have they?

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:30.096
Those two will find their own way back, I'm sure...

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.166
No, we will wait until they return.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.834
If I know Spectra...

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:39.205
he'll come back when he has found something of value...

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.107
Let's see what he finds.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.675
Right!

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.347
You enjoy power too much, Mylene.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.882
Why doesn't that brat listen?

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.985
If he weren't the Prince I would tear him apart...

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.521
[mocking, maniacal laughter]

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:56.723
I love this.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.359
Big scary Mylene taking orders from a kid.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:01.060
Great. Freak show's started.

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:03.296
[maniacal laugh]

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.099
That Royal punks' really got you steamed up...

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.234
You should let him know who's boss.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.969
Mind your own business!

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.337
Suuuuure.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.973
Julie, I'll check if Dan wants to watch a movie.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.007
Ooooh.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.710
How about a romance with lots of kissing?

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.683
Mira, where's Dan?

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:24.884
I'm not sure.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:28.121
He and Baron were talking about going for a run.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:29.422
A run?

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.924
I guess it's okay as long as he takes it easy.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.795
Runo, you and I both know that Dan never takes

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.164
anything easy.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:39.599
Yeah.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.702
After our run we can swim some laps.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.837
Then we can get in some weight training.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.606
Come on, Baron! Pick it up!

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.474
That's it!

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.977
I gotta keep pushing myself or I'm never gonna

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.347
get strong enough to beat Spectra and take back

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.616
Drago...

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:57.817
Master Dan!

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.152
Please wait!

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.386
Can't we...

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.921
take a little rest?

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:04.390
I'm feel like I'm gonna pass out.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.959
What's the matter, Baron?

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.060
Outta shape?

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.596
[running panting]

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.800
I really want to be as strong as you, Master Dan...

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.836
but I'm not quite sure I want to do the work.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:17.970
Come on!

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.605
Seriously...

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.707
I'll hurl if we don't stop

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.243
Okay, take five and chill buddy...

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.380
I'm gonna do a couple of more laps around the lake.

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.848
[running panting]

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.655
[roars and motivated running panting]

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:36.689
[tired groan]

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:39.592
I'm tired just watching him...

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.994
But if he keeps this up he'll have no trouble

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.529
beating Spectra.

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:46.666
I wouldn't be so sure of that, Baron.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.369
One more time!

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.873
Goooooooo!

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.842
[gasp!]

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.611
Master Dan!

00:07:58.644 --> 00:07:59.712
[running panting]

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:00.980
Are you alright?

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:04.817
Wha?

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.153
You've been training too hard...

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.188
[gasp!] Your forehead is so hot...

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.758
We need to go home right away...

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.594
[weak effort]

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.329
No Baron.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.430
I've got to train.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:18.497
For Drago...

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.567
I've.. got... to

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.369
Master Dan!

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.171
[feverish breathing]

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:29.842
The Perfect Core's strength is fading.

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.912
We must retrieve the young dragonoid and restore him

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:36.482
before it is too late for New Vestroia.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.186
Oh, he looks so peaceful, lying there all

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.621
unconscious.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.123
We should have realized he was sick.

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.124
What's the point?

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.592
Dan wouldn't have listened.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:47.860
I should have stopped him.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.428
But he does whatever he wants.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.297
He's Master Dan...

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.966
I guess even he has limits.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.669
If he fights Spectra too soon and loses, I don't

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.537
think he'll be able to take it.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.572
mmmhmm.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.241
So we all agree.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:05.311
We can't let him battle in this condition.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:08.114
Then I'll battle Spectra for Master Dan.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.248
[slight growl]

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.483
I'm sorry, Baron...

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.451
But you're not ready for that...

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:14.086
Spectra is even more dangerous now that he's

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.988
got his hands on Drago.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.623
Then you will have to do it, Mira.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.191
We have no choice!

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.193
[gasp!]

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.962
But I can't.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.364
[feverish breathing]

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.799
Can I battle my brother?

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:27.967
Even for Dan?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.969
Drago.

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:34.106
[flinching gasp]

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.477
Hey, who turned on the lights?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.915
Drago is now mine! [evil chuckle]

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:50.523
I'm coming Drago!

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.124
Where are you?

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.402
If you're here, please answer me!

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.638
[catching breath]

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.141
[taking breath] Dragooo!

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:13.379
[taking breath] Drago!

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.383
I'm sorry, partner...

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.951
I let you down.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:22.989
I wasn't strong enough to stop Spectra.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.325
[sobbing/upset]

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:29.028
Dragoooooo!

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.302
Your call has been answered, Dan Kuso.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:37.503
I know you!

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.105
Indeed you do.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:42.208
I am APOLLONIR, one of New Vestroia's Six Ancient

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.576
Warriors.

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:45.011
It's been a while.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.045
Oh yeah.

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.380
Hey Apollonir...

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.148
But what are you doing here?

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:53.452
I have come to retrieve Drago.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.254
For Drago...

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:56.255
I'm sorry.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:58.024
I'm the reason Drago's gone...

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.992
I wasn't strong enough...

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:02.762
Now Spectra's got him and there's nothing I can do

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.430
to stop the Vexos.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:08.267
I heard your cries for help even in the Perfect Core...

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.571
But you disappoint me, Dan Kuso.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.274
Have you given up so easily?

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:18.778
Do you have the courage to battle once again...

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:21.313
...to win Drago back?

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.581
You bet!

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:26.185
I'll never stop fighting to save Drago and free New Vestroia!

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:27.920
You got my word!

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.923
That is the Dan Kuso I remember.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.691
My dream...

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.629
I saw Drago roaring but he looked totally different...

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.764
He was mean and freaky...

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:42.535
Just like one of those Vexos Bakugan...

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.838
I'm afraid we're already too late to save him.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:49.809
Perhaps he too is losing hope and blaming himself.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.278
Perhaps he is frustrated, just like you.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.579
Frustrated?

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.648
Frustrated by his own weakness.

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:58.150
And angry at himself for losing the battle and

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.552
letting you down.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.623
[frustrated roar]

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.025
That's right...

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.494
Drago wasn't screaming because he's turned bad...

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:11.430
He was...

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:14.433
He was crying for help!

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.869
He was trying to talk to me...

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.238
Trying to help me find him!

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.908
We're still partners!

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.443
Of course you are.

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:27.279
You and Drago share a special bond.

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.448
Yes we do!

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.784
And that's why I'm going to win him back!

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.486
That's the spirit!

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.554
Let the battle begin!

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.156
But you won't be alone.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.992
We'll need the help of all your friends.

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.527
[sudden waking]

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.596
Was that a dream or what!

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.598
See for yourself, hotshot!

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.399
His fever has broken at last.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:50.970
Apollinir!

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.571
[cocky laugh]

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.440
I'm back in the game!

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:58.210
I am relieved you are back.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:02.081
I am linked to the Perfect Core, just like Drago.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.884
Spectra cannot hide him from me.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.952
[\u266a]

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.521
I see him!

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.289
Let us proceed!

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:17.196
What the..?

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:18.864
You finally found me...

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:20.766
took you long enough.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.767
What's the matter?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.769
Afraid to give me another shot?

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:27.239
'Cause after I shut you down I'm gonna take back Drago.

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:28.941
Nice try, whiners.

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.310
You don't stand a chance against Spectra no matter

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.245
how many times you brawl.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:36.248
Then why don't you prove it.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:39.318
You're not worthy of Master Spectra.

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:42.087
I accept your challenge, Dan Kuso.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.889
But why Master?

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:46.692
It's my chance to test the dragonoid's power.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.929
What will you brawl with!

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:53.532
I'm pretty sure I took your only Bakugan.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.301
An ancient warrior Bakugan...

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.036
Meet Apollonir!

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.237
That old thing!

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.005
You really think you can beat Spectra with a

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.941
hand-me-down Bakugan?

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.176
Get ready to eat those words, Gus!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.978
[cocky chuckle]

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.782
Spectra, you know it doesn't have to be this way...

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:13.219
Unless you recognize the Bakugan as living beings...

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:15.321
We'll never stop fighting to free them!

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:16.522
[amused, closed-mouth chuckle]

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.591
Have it your way.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:22.528
Ready, Spectra?

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.331
I'm always ready.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.365
Go Gauntlet...

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.100
Power Strike!

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.707
Helios. I want to test Apollonir to see if he's worthy

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.175
of facing the dragonoid...

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.176
No holding back.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.444
You understand?

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:39.878
Never fear.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:42.781
The old fool has no chance against me.

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:45.551
I will crush him like I crushed Drago.

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:47.553
It was the power of the Forbidden Card that

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.055
defeated Drago...

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:52.992
You won't need it to beat Apollonir.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.860
Quit stalling, Spectra!

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.496
Gate Card Set!

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.534
First...

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.869
You must face...

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:05.104
Haos Helios!

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.972
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:09.708
Bakugan Stand!

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.377
[ready for battle roar]

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:17.483
Hey! That's Helios!

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:19.084
We don't want him!

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.286
Bring out Drago!

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.854
Yeah, bring out the A team!

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.355
[mocking laugh]

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.557
Guess you forgot to say pretty please!

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.060
You've got to earn the right to battle Drago!

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.228
[frustrated tsk]

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:30.896
Then I'll trash Helios and make you

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.997
bring him out!

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.099
I'm counting on you Apollonir.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.535
I am ready for battle.

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:37.870
Okay...

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:40.806
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.775
Pyus Apollonir Stand!

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:46.445
[ready for battle roar]

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.881
So you're one of the six ancient warriors.

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.417
You don't look legendary to me.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.286
You have no Bakugan pride or manners.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.322
I'll have to teach you some.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:16:01.327
[battle roar]

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.330
You'll pay for that!

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.532
[dismissive/amused grunt]

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.566
Keep your cool...

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.068
Helios...

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:10.269
Ability Card Set!

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.771
Ability Activate!

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.607
Maximum Quasar!

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.743
Helios increase 300.

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:21.080
That's it? Dan, let's do this.

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.147
Right!

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.383
Ability Card Set.

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.385
Ability Activate!

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.853
Neo Valute!

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.792
[happy laugh]

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.762
That cuts you down to size

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:39.598
Ha! Not too shabby for an old Bakugan.

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:40.933
[annoyed grunt]

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.167
Way to go, Apollonir!

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.402
That was awesome!

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:46.772
He blew away 400 points in a single move!

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:49.508
Yeah, nothing's going to stop us now!

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:51.310
Ability Activate!

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.078
Saiam Low!

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:56.215
We're going to take all his power level points.

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:58.784
Then, bring on Drago!

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:04.990
[struggling]

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:05.991
No way!

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:07.326
Helios can't even move!

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.927
They're taking down his Power Level without even

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.462
hurting him.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:13.132
It won't be long now.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.101
[defiant battle roar]

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.870
This is a cowardly way to battle.

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.638
Why won't you fight?

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:22.074
We are not like you Vestals.

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:24.810
Why should we bring harm to a fellow Bakugan when

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:29.047
we can simply stop you and take back our friend?

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:32.084
You have much to learn about Bakugan spirit.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.153
[frustrated roar]

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.788
Nobody lectures me...

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:39.091
Bakugan spirit is nothing compared to sheer power.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:41.093
Come Bakugan Trap.

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.961
Pyrus Metalfencer!

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:49.435
Hang on, Helios!

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:52.871
Metalfencer! Go to battle mode immediately!

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:05.584
[battle roar]

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:06.919
Helios and Metalfencer.

00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:08.954
Combination complete.

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.889
Aah snap!

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:13.058
Combining with Metafencer stopped Apollonir's power

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.626
drain.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.495
Now the battle begins.

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:17.830
Ability Card Set.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.199
Ability Activate.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:21.433
Red Valkyrie!

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:24.903
[battle roar]

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.706
That's more like it!

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.475
Fire!

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.045
Not so fast!

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:35.781
Ability Activate!

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:39.852
Neo Valute!

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.987
Just can't get it started, huh guys?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.123
I'll just blast my way through your shield!

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.329
[defiant roar]

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.130
A feeble attack.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.500
What kind of a warrior depends on a machine like

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.001
that!

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.903
Dan!

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:00.272
Show him how a true brawler battles!

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:01.673
Right!

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:02.908
Here we go!

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.309
Ability Card Set

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.711
Ability Activate!

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.646
Maximum Pyrus!

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.187
Helios!

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.321
[closed-mouth frustrated]

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.790
He swatted Helios and Metalfencer from the sky

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.359
like insects!

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.094
Impossible!

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.295
I never lose!

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.868
First time for everything.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.203
Awesome!

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.572
Apollonir IS legendary!

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:36.608
No way Spectra and the Vexos can touch him!

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.411
It's not just my power that won...

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:42.581
Your love for the Bakugan gives me strength!

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.783
[impressed grunt] They weren't kidding.

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.685
He is one of the ancient... six warriors.

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:48.487
Impressive.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:51.924
Give me another chance.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.425
I can take him!

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.760
No, I think not...

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.728
Perhaps this one can bring out the beast in our

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.096
dragonoid.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.731
Let's go Spectra.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.134
We're tired of waiting for the main event!

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.304
Only one opponent is worthy of my power...

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.538
Drago!

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.639
All right.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.509
Gate Card... Set!

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.814
Bakugan Brawl!

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:20.285
[ready for battle roar]

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.554
At last a real test...

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:24.456
Let's unleash the power...

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.925
...of the perfect dragonoid!

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.227
Okay, you want Drago?

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.129
Bakugan Brawl!

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.265
Stand Pyrus Drago!

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.172
[evil, defiant roar]

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:41.873
Calculating Power Levels

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.276
Oh No! That's Drago?

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:46.278
What have they done to you?

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:49.581
Woaah!

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.585
Are we too late?

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:56.521
[menacing growl]

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.557
[evil, confident chuckle]

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.726
[threatening battle roar]

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.827
What's wrong?

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.630
Don't you recognize your old friend Drago?

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:08.500
Hey Brawlers.

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:09.968
My dream of saving Drago just turned into a

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:12.404
nightmare!

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.306
How's a guy supposed to fight his friend who's

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.807
turned evil?

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.442
All Spectra cares about is using the power of the

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.878
Perfect Core and the Forbidden Card to turn

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:23.048
Drago into a monster Bakugan!

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:26.251
That guy really burns me up but his final trick has

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:28.420
the opposite effect on Drago!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:29.688
Be here next time!

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.590
I need all the help I can get!

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.126
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:36.261
Don't miss the battle of the century!

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:37.696
Let's go!

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:47.773
[\u266a]

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:57.416
[\u266a]
