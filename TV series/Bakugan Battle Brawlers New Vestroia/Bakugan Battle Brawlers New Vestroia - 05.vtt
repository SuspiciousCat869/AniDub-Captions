WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.974
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.542
to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:10.710
So we joined up

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.679
with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.248
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.518
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.954
Every battle makes us stronger

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.957
and brings us closer to our goal.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.393
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension Controllers

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.994
to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.029
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.431
[\u266a]

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.832
We're ready to roll...

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.301
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.138
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.508
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.510
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.778
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.546
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.981
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.849
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.217
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.186
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.990
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.826
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.662
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:03.997
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.501
GUS (out of breath): I have nowhere left to go.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.936
I'm beaten and broken.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.738
Please, give me a sign.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:16.876
[\u266a]

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.244
SPECTRA: So...

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.612
you see it too, do you?

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.017
You've been chosen...

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.020
Join me and fight for a new world.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.425
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.627
in \"Taste Of Defeat\".

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.903
[\u266a]

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.371
GUS: Thank you for meeting here

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.507
on such short notice.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.576
Yeah, yeah... Cut to the chase.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.612
All I can say is this better be important.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.048
I'm sure Gus has a good reason...

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.182
Right, Gus?

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.550
Why have you dragged us here?

00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.786
You should know...

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.721
You're here because all of you have failed.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.657
Whaddya mean by that, Freak?

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.493
As I have said.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.661
You're asking for it.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.130
Gus means that...

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:14.300
from now on we can not afford to lose another battle.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.802
Look, next time...

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.505
I'll demolish them before they can load their gauntlets.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.106
Didn't you lose...

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.374
three Bakugan to them?

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.742
What's your point?

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.344
MYLENE: Stop bickering you fools.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.612
SPECTRA: That's it!

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.847
If I may speak... Master Spectra...

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.916
Go ahead Gus...

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.751
Please allow me to go next...

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.854
I will prove to you that this upstart Brawler Resistance

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.289
can be beaten.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:42.996
[\u266a]

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.331
[grumble] Spectra's little pet.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.637
[\u266a]

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.905
This is so nice

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.907
it's tempting to think the whole Vestal thing

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.375
is just a dream.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.744
Well don't get too carried away or you'll wake up

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.113
to find yourself in a nightmare.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.281
He's right...

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.382
So here, Dan...

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.817
This should help you against the Vexos.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.952
What is it?

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.720
A Bakugan Trap.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.622
What the...

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.524
[loud thunderclap]

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:15.161
Come, Bakugan Trap... Aqua Tripod Theta!

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.632
MYLENE: Tripod Theta is a powerful ancient Bakugan

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.034
long thought extinct.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.602
But thanks to Vestal science

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.804
we have revived him as a Trap Bakugan.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.774
I remember Mylene used one of those in our battle.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.509
MIRA: It's called Scorpion.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.843
... This is so Cool.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.412
He's not even round.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.181
DRAGO: It's an honour to meet you, Scorpion.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.150
What's the matter, dude? A little shy?

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.688
To be honest, we're still learning

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.656
about the Trap Bakugan, Dan...

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.425
But it seems like they're unable

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.093
or unwilling to talk to us.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.830
Well I think they probably use another form of communication.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.165
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:54.267
Howdja like to join our team, pal?

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.036
DAN: Okay then!

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.173
Let's blow the dust off and get a little training in...

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.308
Okay Drago... Let's go!

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.343
DRAGO: Right!

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.816
There...

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.784
Why don't we start off with a little triple ability?

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.753
DRAGO: Sounds good to me...

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.457
What's up, Scorpion?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.326
I think he senses something coming.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:31.571
[\u266a]

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.739
What the...

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.974
Careful, Dan. This doesn't feel right.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.449
[quiet growl]

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.918
That's a fine Bakugan you have.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.287
He sure is...

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.789
I mean, what are you doing here?

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.424
I'm hiking through the area

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:54.093
to collect and study soil samples.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.695
And who are you?

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.497
I'm with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resi...

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.598
Dan!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.200
I mean, we're here to save the Bakugan...

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.769
Nice save...

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.270
Interesting...

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.304
But why...

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.607
are you so concerned with Bakugan?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.108
They're my friends.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.977
But what's in it for you?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.079
Whaddya mean?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.881
You don't know why you battle.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.082
You're an amateur.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.250
Amateur?!

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.986
Maybe you're just some kind of mindless do-gooder...

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.889
Or maybe you're hungry for power.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:23.990
No way, man.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.526
Then what's the answer to my question?

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.094
It's more... complicated.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.897
GUS: Battling without purpose is meaningless!

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.231
Hang on...

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.300
Who are you anyway?

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.475
GUS: I too am interested in the future of the Bakugan...

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:45.411
For my own personal reasons.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.347
[grumbling]

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.648
Catch you later...

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.816
Dan Kuso.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.921
What's that guy's damage?

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.090
DRAGO: And how did he know your name?

00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:02.495
[\u266a]

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.297
You're back.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.199
What did you find out from your encounter

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.401
with the Resistance?

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.136
GUS: Their newest battle brawler

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.971
is nothing more than an amateur.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.806
Be careful, Gus...

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.376
Don't underestimate Dan Kuso.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.378
He is nothing but a child.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.547
He may prove to be our greatest opponent.

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.882
Then it's also possible

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:25.218
that he could prove to be our greatest ally.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.187
You, and only you, could bring our two worlds together.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.656
I will make them understand.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.966
GUS: If only I could make

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.968
the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.204
experience the light I saw that day...

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.242
ANNOUNCER: And now Brawlers,

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:51.844
is the battle you've been waiting for...

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.882
Top Ranked Bad Boy with a Bakugan, Spectra!

00:06:55.915 --> 00:07:01.287
And the fastest rising star of New Vestroia, Gus!

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.357
General Quasar plus Melt Stream!

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.027
Don't think you can intimidate me...

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.929
with your Double Ability!

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.130
Ability Activate!

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.865
Viblow!

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.474
Now, Triple Ability.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.609
Plus, Fusion Ability Activate!

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.777
Omega!

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.514
Combination Fusion Ability?

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.682
Impossible!

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:43.696
[\u266a]

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.232
No... Vu-vulcan...

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:49.068
[chuckle]

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.571
You never stood a chance against me.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.874
[groaning]

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.077
GUS: I have nowhere left to go.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.779
I'm beaten and broken.

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.948
Spectra was absolutely right...

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.117
I was completely outclassed by his power.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.420
Show me a sign.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.059
The eyes.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:14.227
They're shining!

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.495
SPECTRA: So... you see it too, do you?

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.697
GUS: Yes.

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.833
You have been chosen...

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.802
Join me and we'll fight...

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.604
for a new world, Gus.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:28.241
Together we will remake New Vestroia.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.509
What shall it be, Gus?

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.346
Do you dare grab the future for your own?

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.017
GUS: From that moment on,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.386
I was committed to Master Spectra

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.822
and his vision of a united New Vestroia.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.591
Bakugan Battles were no longer just a game to me

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.896
but a means to a very important end.

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.098
With each battle I would help build a world

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.301
more beautiful and powerful than ever imagined.

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.470
Together, with Master Spectra,

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.605
anything is possible!

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:02.775
Premo Vulcan!

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:06.412
We are now in the service of Spectra!

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.050
MIRA: You think he was a member of Vexos?

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.385
MARUCHO: He sounds strange enough

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.020
to be a member of that crew.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.555
Yeah... Too true.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.089
So tell us what happened.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.191
Did he mess with your mind?

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.793
He sure tried to...

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.995
But I was too smooth for him.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.734
ALL: Ahh!

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.003
Look out there!

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.645
Tell me Dan Kuso!

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.747
Have you found your answer yet?

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.283
Why do you Bakugan Brawl?

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.521
DAN: We'll be right back with more brawling action!

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.124
GUS: Stay tuned.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.293
My master, Spectra, has plans for you.

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.166
No more silly disguises?

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.034
No more...

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.170
My real name is Gus Grav...

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.039
My master Spectra sends his regards.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.174
Careful...

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.242
He's the number two Vexos.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.844
Just second best?

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:16.749
I'm tired of your head games, Gus.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.384
This is no game...

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.654
I fight to protect my friends and you can't stop me.

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.690
You are so naive, Dan.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:25.858
That's it!

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.761
Let's see if you brawl as big as you talk...

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.196
Come on!

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:32.665
As you wish.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.600
Don't let him get to you, Dan.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:35.801
He's tricky.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.737
Spank him, down Master Dan!

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.373
Show him you're the best brawler in the universe!

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.975
Beware of overconfidence, Baron.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.878
Looks like their friendly, little game...

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.880
...Just got serious!

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.850
BOTH: Alright, Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.885
Gate Card Set!

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.558
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.293
Drago Stand!

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:05.164
[roar]

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.732
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.434
Premo Vulcan Stand!

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.303
Together we'll crush the Resistance,

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.140
Subterra PremoVulcan!

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.108
VULCAN: Oh mighty Terra...

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:19.412
...Give me your irresistible power!

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.846
MIRA: Subterra Premo Vulcan

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.883
may be a bigger problem than we thought!

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.284
GAUNTLET: Battlefield Open.

00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.453
A power level of five hundred?

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:28.888
That's right...

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.089
Now, Premo Vulcan!

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.590
Enough talk!

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.292
Fine by me!

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.397
Drago!

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:43.769
[laughs]

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:46.739
You guys are so far out of your league it's sad!

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:50.142
Then I guess it's time to stop holding back!

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.645
Gate Card Open!

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.046
Pyrus Reactor!

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.281
This should even the odds.

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:56.816
GAUNTLET: Power Level Increase

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.684
DAN: And now for my next trick!

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.087
Double Ability Activate!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.955
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.357
DAN: Fire Tornado plus Burning Dragon!

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.159
GAUNTLET: Drago Power level Increase

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.661
DAN: This will take you down to size!

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.529
Bring on the heat, Drago!

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:15.634
[loud roar]

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.070
Nice try...

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.939
Ability Activate!

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.807
Heavy Aigis!

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:26.912
VULCAN: Time to play fire extinguisher!

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.851
DRAGO: Unbelievable!

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.220
Are you kidding?

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.122
He should be molten slag!

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:38.757
[laughs] Premo Vulcan's body

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.259
is made from New Vestroia's

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:42.094
most indestructible metal.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.096
And when Heavy Aigis is activated,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.999
that defense is amplified a hundred-fold,

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.702
making your pitiful attack useless.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:55.141
I think it's time for your first lesson in true power...

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.042
Learn it well.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.711
Ability Activate.

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.279
Titan Knuckle!

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.481
VULCAN: Do you concede defeat?

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.416
I will never back down!

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.019
Then I'll make you bow.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.020
What the..?

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:12.691
[\u266a]

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:13.859
Drago...!

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.263
DAN: They're five hundred points apart!

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.331
I could lose Drago!

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.433
GUS: Welcome to the big leagues kid.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.069
Terra itself gives Premo Vulcan strength.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.604
You can't resist.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:26.939
Think!

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.874
Drago's toast if I don't do something...

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.876
right now!

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.345
It's called Scorpion...

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:34.980
DAN: This better work.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:37.316
I'm counting on you, Pyrus Scorpion!

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.224
[loud screech]

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.259
DAN: That ought to even the odds a bit.

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:49.261
GAUNTLET: Drago power level increase...

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:50.362
So...

00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.665
You think you can use a Bakugan Trap.

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.700
Oh, I'm full of surprises...

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.869
Double Ability Activate.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:59.305
Time to knock Premo Vulcan down to size.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.106
He won't be able to use his arms!

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:06.478
Don't forget...Premo Vulcan is still able to fly.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.515
Not after this.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.150
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.552
DAN: Burning Dragon! Plus, Satellite Boost!

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.125
Try aiming-- Huh?

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.765
AHH!

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.535
Bullseye!

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.771
GAUNTLET: Drago, Scorpion Power Level 1050.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.707
GUS: Not bad.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.908
Not bad at all.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:38.344
I like how you used Premo Vulcan's blind spot

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.779
to sneak in your little attack.

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.147
DRAGO: Your patronizing attitude

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.149
is starting to annoy me.

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:48.020
My apologies...

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.322
I was merely trying to encourage you...

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.124
This battle is not over.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.492
It's just begun.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.161
Ability Card Set!

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.731
Ability Activate, Pyrus Durance!

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.870
GAUNTLET: Drago, Scorpion Power Level 750.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.108
[Drago screams]

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.911
They're out! Oh no!

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.314
GAUNTLET: Life Gauge 350.

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:17.049
Lesson one:

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.051
Never take your opponent's defeat for granted...

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.453
There's always a chance they might have one or two more

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.622
cards up their sleeve.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.828
Let's get down to business, shall we?

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:31.263
Dan Kuso,

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:34.767
It's time for me to show you how the big boys play.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.568
[laughs] Sounds good to us.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.970
Right, Drago?

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:39.204
DRAGO: Right!

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.473
Go PremoVulcan!

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.145
[roar]

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:48.881
It's up to you, Drago!

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.352
And don't forget...

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.754
Scorpion Stand!

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.661
Gate Card Open...

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.431
Subterra Reactor.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:12.604
I'll show you the true power of a Bakugan Trap...

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.240
Hexados Stand!

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:24.083
Ability Activate.

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.784
Ray Drill!

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.924
GAUNTLET: Hexados Power Level 550.

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:33.926
Ability Activate!

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.362
Reflection Boost!

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.500
GAUNTLET: Power Level Decrease.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.802
... Big deal...

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.306
Now to prove what an amateur you are.

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.508
You can't beat what you can't see!

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.744
DAN: Oh man...

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.145
MARUCHO: Did Hexados run away?

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.580
ACE: No! Listen!

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.048
MIRA: Look out!

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:01.587
GAUNTLET: Scorpion eliminated.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.021
DAN: Scorpion!

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.791
Scorpion!

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.326
He went down hard!

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.594
Be careful Dan...

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:10.129
Your Life Gauge is low!

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:12.231
You need to turn this around quick!

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.700
Drago can't face both of them alone!

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:15.834
Drago's never alone!

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.669
Triple Ability Activate!

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.937
Oh No! You can't!

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.906
DAN: Burning Dragon.

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.712
GAUNTLET: Drago increase 200.

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.250
GUS: My life meter's dropping!

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.851
Yeeeeeah! Crunch him, Dan!

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.153
Amateur, huh?

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:38.157
Burning Tornado plus Fusion Ability Pyrus Slayer!

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:45.364
GAUNTLET: Drago Power Level one one zero zero.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.368
GUS: H-He's using a Triple Ability!

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:52.905
This Drago may be almost as powerful as Helios!

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:54.873
What's the next lesson?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:59.378
Lucky shot...You can dish it out but can you take it?

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.913
Ability Activate!

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.247
Viblow!

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:09.088
[\u266a]

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:12.024
GAUNTLET: Vulcan Power Level eight zero zero.

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.659
DAN: Keep fighting, Drago!

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:16.528
[roaring]

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:23.235
Huh? Nothing?

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.671
GUS: You don't understand do you, Dan?

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:28.140
I cannot lose.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.876
Victory is my destiny.

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.011
My master Spectra...

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.915
has promised to change the world and I'm going to help.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.851
New Vestroia isn't yours to change.

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.719
And Bakugan aren't slaves!

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.421
Your destiny is a lie!

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.857
Fool, we all serve Master Spectra...

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.625
And soon...

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.827
You and Drago will bow before him.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.729
No way!

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.397
That'll never happen!

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.566
GUS: There's no use fighting, Dan.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.070
Spectra is leading us all into a new future with him...

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.639
And Premo Vulcan and I will rule at his side.

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.040
You're crazy.

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.342
Enough insolence.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.843
Ability Activate!

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.612
Drill Impact!

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:13.285
You battle for friendship but I battle for power.

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.454
Drago!

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:18.390
GUS: That is why you'll never be good enough to defeat me!

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.592
Say goodbye, Dan Kuso.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.027
Dan! Look out!

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.230
So ends the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.769
DAN: Just in time, partner.

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:33.972
Behind you!

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.212
GAUNTLET: Drago, Power Level decrease two zero zero.

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:51.290
[\u266a]

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:52.691
Drago's down!

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:53.825
It's okay...

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.594
At least Drago won't be taken...

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:57.663
The Power Level difference is too low.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.432
GAUNTLET: Life Meter: Zero. Winner: Gus.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.768
I can't believe Master Dan lost.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:06.905
It's like I told you... Friendship doesn't matter.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.206
Power does.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.841
Thanks to Master Spectra

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:13.178
I am now more than a Bakugan Brawler...

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.380
Give up while you still can.

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:22.955
GUS: I have brought you victory, my master.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.790
As promised.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.458
You have done well, Gus...

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:29.294
You have brought pride back to the Vexos.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:32.130
LYNC: Looks like the weasel won after all.

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:33.265
VOLT: Who cares?

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.534
SHADOW: Yeah! Yeah! Whatever.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.703
MYLENE: It's not quite over yet.

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:40.706
Dan?

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.040
It's okay, Master.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.043
MIRA: Gus is the Vexos Number Two Brawler, after all.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.144
True.

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.647
Even I might have had some trouble beating him.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.715
Oh yeah!

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:52.684
That was the best Bakugan Brawl ever!

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:53.785
What?

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.387
Well, I guess so.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.822
The only way to get better...

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.690
is to battle the best.

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.325
We'll show him next time!

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:02.094
We're gonna practice night and day.

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:04.263
ACE: I've never seen anyone so happy to lose.

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:05.964
DRAGO: Daniel is a true brawler.

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:11.303
DAN: Gus Grav almost took Drago away

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:14.006
but close isn't good enough for Spectra!

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.008
This time it's double trouble when they both

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.644
challenge us to a brawl.

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:21.546
Drago and I are always up for a battle

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.982
but these guys are tough!

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:26.018
Say goodbye to Drago forever!

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:30.055
DAN: We're going to need a miracle to get out of this one.

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.190
Trust me.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.692
You don't want to miss this!

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.994
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.195
I'll see you then.
