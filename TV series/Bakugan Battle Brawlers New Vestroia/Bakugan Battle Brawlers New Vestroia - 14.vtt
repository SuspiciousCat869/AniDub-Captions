WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.441
DAN: When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.377
and captured all the Bakugan,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.078
they didn't count on Drago and I

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.647
returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.317
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.221
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.623
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos,

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:28.995
take back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.663
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.599
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are you going to do? \u266a

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.844
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.579
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.047
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.783
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.286
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.090
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.429
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.063
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:18.878
[\u266a]

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.981
I don't know why you had to bring us to a desert.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.917
MARUCHO: Don't think of it as a desert.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.118
Think of it as a really big beach.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.424
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Duel in the Dunes.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.695
Well, here we are!

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.030
Wow...

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.531
I can't believe it!

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.233
Finally! Master Dan's house!

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.701
It's so awesome!

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.770
DRAGO: Can we move this tour along?

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.206
You know, Baron's got a point.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.007
I haven't been home for a while...

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.476
I really missed this place.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.911
My house doesn't transform into a trailer

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.947
but it's still pretty cool I think.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.548
I'm sure it is.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.616
Yeah!

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.486
I want the full on Dan Kuso experience...

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.454
Bring it on. Totally!

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.591
I'm home!

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.227
Daniel!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.695
I'm so glad you're back...

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.931
Your father and I have missed you so much.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.433
Oh mom!

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.804
Oh son!

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.205
Oh boy, it's good to meet you!

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.340
Me?

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.475
No way... Impossible.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.478
You're even younger and prettier than I imagined...

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.880
Master Dan's mom!

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.615
You little sweetie...

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.683
And... what is your name?

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:31.885
Baron!

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.620
Well welcome, Baron...

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.088
Please make yourself at home.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.823
You won't even notice me...

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.058
He's giving me a rash.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.261
He's one friendly guy.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.763
Just a little something I whipped up!

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.798
Dig in, everyone!

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.275
I didn't know you were a gourmet chef, Master Dan's mother.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.443
Let her go!

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:58.912
And who wins the Spudnuts.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.547
Oh, I know... I know!

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.151
This bath thing is great!

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.453
Life at Master Dan's house is awesome!

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.691
Hey Mira...

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.160
I can't believe Mom roped you into joining her.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.296
Is this...

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.064
some Earth... torture?

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.098
Sort of.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.900
It's called yoga.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.803
Time for my pudding break.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.606
The only question is; which flavour to choose.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.907
Speaking of choosing,

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.110
is Mira your new girlfriend?

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.313
Dad! What are you talking about?

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.281
We're just brawling partners.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.584
That's cool.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.252
We're working together to free the Bakugan.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.653
That's it. End of story.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.488
I won't be freeing any Bakugan,

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.524
unless I get out of this pose.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.730
VOLT: It's bad enough I'm the one stuck battling

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.199
the dweeb of the Resistance.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:56.469
But now I have to find him too?

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.071
It just figures that he'd get himself lost

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.939
in a sandstorm.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:03.142
It seems like a win win situation to me.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.178
Either the little loser fries in the desert

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:07.714
or you and I burn him in battle.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.850
It's almost poetic, don't you think? (laughs)

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.686
You know I'm not into poetry.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.122
Oh of course, Volt.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.190
MARUCHO: Wow.

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.792
This is the biggest sandbox I've ever seen.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.594
Next time we fall into a trap, remind me to bring

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:25.298
my SPF 3 million suntan lotion.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.134
Lay off the cheesy jokes, Marucho.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.069
We've got to find a way out of this.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.705
My creamy blue skin doesn't need a tan.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.540
Uh... Sorry.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.577
I was just trying to keep things light.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.713
Yeah? Well focus on which way we should be going.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.849
Left or right?

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:45.318
Either way looks bad.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.156
I'm so thirsty I could drink an ocean...

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.391
No, wait a minute.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.026
I'm so thirsty I could drink an ocean then go

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:54.961
back for a refill.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.095
Hey!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.830
I'm an Aquos attribute Bakugan.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.866
We know how to handle the desert.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.868
What have you got in mind?

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.537
Well, how about a little shade?

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.773
A parasol is handy for keeping the hot sun

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.675
off your skin.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:13.913
I always carry one for just such an occasion.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.214
I'm so thirsty...

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.084
I'm too thirsty to even joke anymore.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.318
Oh.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:23.156
You mean you were serious about being thirsty?

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.657
Oh, I can help with that.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.929
Open wide, Marucho!

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.464
It's time to wet your whistle!

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.832
Slow down. You're going too fast...

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.267
By the way, what is a whistle?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.635
Come on, Marucho.

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:36.869
The fountain's open.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.104
Want some water?

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.505
Ooh, too slow!

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.973
Give me a break.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.575
My tongue's so dry it's gonna fall off.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.078
Uh oh. That's all there is...

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.413
What? Nooo! All gone!

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.686
My water...

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.887
Sorry...

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.523
but you snooze, you lose.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.158
What?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.861
You were the one spraying it all over the place!

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.764
Don't complain to me, slowpoke.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.933
You're the reason we're lost in this overgrown

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.268
sandpit in the first place.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.536
Why didn't you stop me?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.971
You're supposed to be so smart.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.474
Why didn't you see I was walking into a trap?

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.608
I am smart....

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.477
Yeah, real smart...

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.016
VOLT: Where is that little dwiener?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.952
I've been across this desert ten times

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.887
and there's still no sign of him.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.456
Just so you know, when we get home,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.959
I'll be looking for a new partner.

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.227
Sounds good to me.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.896
I don't want a partner who sleeps under lily pads.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.231
Fine.

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.866
Then we're agreed...

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.569
I don't even care if you apologize...

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.605
I've made up my mind.

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:48.040
Look over there! Woohoo!

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.780
Cool pools and shady trees.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.148
Here I come!

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.350
Something doesn't feel right...

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.385
Wait for me, Elfin!

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:00.686
ELFIN: No way!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.123
You're not holding me back any longer, Marucho.

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.759
What the...?

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.895
It just disappeared.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.062
I figured.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.564
Sorry.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.965
I know it looked like an oasis, Elfin, but it was

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.333
just a mirage.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.002
That's a trick the desert plays on your mind

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.104
when you're hot and thirsty.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:21.174
Well it's a nasty trick, Marucho!

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.275
I know...

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.609
I'm tired of this desert.

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:25.211
I want to go home...

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:28.114
Elfin! Come back!

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.316
I'm... so... weak...

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:39.725
Whoa!

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.864
W-what's happening?

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:45.998
I think...

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.967
I'm sinking in quick sand!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.502
Quick sand! ?

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.770
That's bad, right?

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.572
Don't worry Marucho...

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.208
I'll pull you out.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.610
Save yourself, Elfin!

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:59.478
Don't be silly.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.882
I'll have you out of here in no time.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.051
Let me go and save yourself!

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.186
Please! Before it's too late!

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.522
No!

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.990
This is all my fault.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.392
I won't let you go.

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:15.094
This is it, Elfin!

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.266
I'm sorry I let you down, Dan.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.238
When was this picture taken?

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.039
That's the Battle Brawlers...

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:30.009
We were celebrating after saving Vestroia.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.345
Those were some pretty sweet times.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.381
... The six original Brawlers.

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:37.750
DAN: Yeah, we were a pretty tight group.

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:41.053
We fought hard and together, we won.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.822
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance...

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.791
is gonna hammer those Vexos too...

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.660
Right Mira?

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.196
...Uh, right.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.569
DAN: I hope we can get back to New Vestroia soon...

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.170
The guys need our help...

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.872
against the Vexos...

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.574
We're on the way...

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:02.975
Ace, Shun...

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.877
and Marucho...

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:10.683
We'll be right back... I hope.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.486
We're back.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.788
And I hope you brought us a glass of water!

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.124
No...

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.826
I'm not going to let a little sand stop me.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.261
Never give up!

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.163
Dan is counting on us...

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.898
Right on, Marucho!

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:26.966
You can do it.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.200
Yeah!

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:32.238
As long as we're the only ones who can save the Bakugan,

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:33.539
we can't stop.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.640
Yay!

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:37.910
[chanting] Mar-u-cho! Mar-u-cho!

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.016
We're rescued!

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:46.585
Almost there!

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:47.720
Right...

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:55.828
[\u266a]

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.263
MARUCHO: Volt?

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.565
We're better off in the sand pit.

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.033
You saved us?

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:03.002
You're wasting time...

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.537
Get climbing.

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:12.011
You're pretty tough for a little squirt.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.179
I don't get it.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.814
We're sworn enemies...

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.616
Why are you helping me?

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.518
One reason...

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:22.421
The desert is no end for a warrior...

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.556
And despite your size

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.858
you've proven to be a worthy opponent.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:29.095
A Brawler's fate is decided in battle...

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.297
That's how the Vexos do it.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.433
Okay then...

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.402
If you're looking for a brawl,

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.070
then you've got one.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.841
I accept your challenge!

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:44.877
And you wouldn't happen to have sunscreen, would you?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.911
...No?

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.113
Okay then.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.814
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet Activated.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:52.785
BOTH: Gauntlet... Power Strike!

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.987
We've got to make this fast, Elfin.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.822
We're too weak to battle for long.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.991
Gate Card... Open!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.263
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:07.033
Brontes Stand!

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:10.870
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the desert!

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:13.072
HAHAHA!

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:14.740
Marucho, stop staring!

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:15.741
Right!

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.376
We can do this Elfin...

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.478
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.913
Elfin Stand!

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:25.117
Sun, wind and rain combine.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.887
Let Aquos Elfin appear!

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.588
You're the bully of the beach!

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.294
It's so hot...

00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:36.662
Couldn't we brawl somewhere

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:37.797
with air-conditioning instead?

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.532
Elfin!

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.733
You're hot?

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:42.635
Then I'll cool you down for good!

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.503
Ability Activate!

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.138
Jeel Frontier!

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.412
Nothing happened!

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:02.988
Marucho!

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.857
It's a real oasis!

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.493
\u266a Swimming! Swimming!

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:08.627
Elfin!

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:10.329
What the heck are you doing?

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.664
Forget it.

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.299
She's gone to her happy place and Jeel Frontier

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.467
keeps you from activating

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.668
any abilities to help her.

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:16.735
Oh... yeah!

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.904
Come on in, Marucho!

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.606
The water's fine!

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.042
MARUCHO: She's totally gone!

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.510
You know the rules...

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:27.279
Always swim with a buddy!

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.081
You're on lifeguard duty.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.316
Bakugan Trap!

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:33.152
Aquos Tripod Epsilon!

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.956
A Bakugan Trap?

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:38.724
Watch out Brontes.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.426
Those things are deadly!

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.437
You're Tripod Epsilon?

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.605
Uuuh...

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:53.839
Okay...

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.841
Let's do this.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.643
Ability Activate!

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:58.978
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set!

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.580
Cool Snail!

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:04.483
What? ! I can't move!

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:07.486
The frog's aura is blocking my abilities.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.688
Right! Haos Ability Activate!

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.423
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.361
Diamond Snail!

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:18.230
Soooo cool!

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.566
What the...? The sand is so hot!

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.501
Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot!

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.805
You blocked Brontes' abilities!

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:27.907
That's not all!

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.942
Subterra Ability Activate!

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.410
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.381
MARUCHO: Canyon Snail!

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.522
GAUNTLET: Brontes decrease 200.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.124
MARUCHO: We totally did it!

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.593
Way to go, Tripod Epsilon!

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:48.961
I can't tell who to thank.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.563
The frog or the snail?

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:54.366
Ability Activate!

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.569
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set!

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:59.238
Darkus Howl Trigger!

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.141
MARUCHO: Um... Did he say Darkus?

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:09.648
You celebrate victory too soon!

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.321
VOLT: So much for froggy.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:18.224
What next? A tadpole?

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:21.227
Tripod Epsilon!

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.930
Darkus Howl Trigger is Brontes' special ability.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.466
It means he can use a Darkus ability and turn

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:31.770
your day at the beach into a loser's nightmare!

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:32.905
Think so?

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.207
Not while Elfin can change her attribute too!

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:41.113
Sun, wind and rain combine!

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:44.016
Let Ventus Elfin appear!

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:47.019
You are in... trouble now!

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.387
Ability Activate!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.855
Wing Mercury!

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.925
Green and mean!

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.693
HA! Gate Card Open!

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.329
Haos Reactor!

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.265
GAUNTLET: Brontes increase 100.

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.800
Ability Activate.

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.970
Luny Magical!

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.006
What? Hey!

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.878
It's easy to swat such a pesky mosquito...

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.814
...with my Haos ability!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.353
No, Elfin, no!

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.859
That's not fair!

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:29.194
He's using Haos and Darkus abilities!

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.230
Shouldn't there be a penalty for that?

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.298
That's it!

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.899
All we need to do is shut down Haos and Darkus

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.235
at the same time!

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.703
You can do that?

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.471
Get ready for round two!

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:41.840
Gate Card, Set!

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.842
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:48.914
The last time the sun was in my eyes

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.483
but this time I'm ready!

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.985
We'll see...

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.887
Bakugan brawl!

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.422
Brontes Stand!

00:15:57.589 --> 00:16:00.359
How many times do we have to slap you down?

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:02.294
As many times as it takes!

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.864
Gate Card Open! Aquos Reactor!

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:06.932
Alright!

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.600
We're wet and wild again!

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.573
Don't you hold back, Marucho!

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.241
Ability Activate!

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.476
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:20.045
MARUCHO: Subterra Reaction!

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:22.214
BRONTES: Volt, what's happening?

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.248
Brontes!

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:25.150
It's Subterra Reaction...

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:27.486
One of Aquos Elfin's special abilities.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:30.322
We just changed your attribute to Subterra.

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.725
Now you can't use Haos or Darkus abilities!

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.760
Marucho, you rock!

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.562
We've got them now, Elfin!

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.497
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

ELFIN: Soak it up!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:56.048
[loud scream]

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.222
MARUCHO: Who's the fall guy this time, Volt?

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.792
Not bad, huh?

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.694
Not bad at all...

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.195
I like to see a little fire

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:12.398
before I stamp it out!

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.700
Gate Card Open!

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.903
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.572
No more fooling around.

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.508
We'll show them who's fooling...

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.778
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.312
I'm not finished yet...

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.983

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:40.392

Dynamo!

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:46.064
What's with Vexos and cyber stuff?

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.033
VOLT: Why don't I show you?

00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:50.469
Brontes, Drone Spider!

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.404
Oh yes!

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.607
Change, Dynamo Brontes!

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.677
Combine!

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.746
ELFIN: Uh, bad idea.

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.948
Those colours totally clash.

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:10.522
Marucho... Where'd they go?

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.690
VOLT: Don't worry.

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.759
They're very close.

Desert Python!

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.435
It doesn't matter where you run!

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.703
Hey, leave me alone!

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:25.938
What did I ever do to you?

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:27.673
You guys are a bunch of--

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.142
VOLT: It will find you!

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:31.610
Run, Elfin!

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:34.079
I've got to get another Bakugan out there...

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:36.849
I need your help Bakugan Trap...

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.784

MARUCHO: Desert Marine!

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.561
This will even things out!

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:54.566
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.271
Gotcha!

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.174
You've got 'em now!

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.943
In that case, no more hiding!

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:05.944
Good!

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.813
As long as I can see you, I can beat you!

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.381
Attribute Change...

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.649
Here comes Darkus!

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:11.884
Yeah!

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.485
Hiiiii...

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.887
Yaaaaaahhhh!

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.855
Too slow!

Oh he croaked!

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.272
Don't mess with the frog!

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.873
You're so right!

Do you feel my Darkus Power rising?!

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.583
Nice work...

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.919
That move just strengthened our Darkus power too!

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.856
I forgot!

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.891

Uh... no.

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:06.405
You can't run and you can't hide from this ability.

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:07.639
And best of all,

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:11.276
it combines Dynamo and Brontes' Power Levels!

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.514
Are you afraid of the dark?

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.416
You should be!

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.119
Ahh!

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:25.023
[scream]

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.725
Elfin, hold on!

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:29.027
I can't!

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.601
I'm disappointed.

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.302
I thought the Earth brawler would put up a

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:38.670
better fight.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.672
But at least we can use this one as bait

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.574
to trap the others...

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.710
Say goodbye to the Resistance!

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:47.813
Noooooooooo!

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:50.749
Marucho!

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:55.654
Dan, what's wrong?

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.657
Nothing. Just a dream.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.225
THINKING: Dream or not.

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:02.494
I have to find a way to get back to New Vestroia

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.363
and help Shun and Marucho...

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.598
before it's too late!

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.069
Shun here.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.671
Marucho and Ace have disappeared so it looks like

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:16.274
I'm all that's left of the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.177
But I'm not alone as long as I have Ingram with me.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.513
That's why I'm not worried when freako Shadow Prove

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.715
challenges us to a brawl.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.117
So why's he laughing?

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.251
Because...

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:28.654
his new Bakugan is our old enemy...

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:29.921
Hydra!

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.190
It's gonna be a serious grudge match!

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:35.027
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.696
This is too intense! Be there!
