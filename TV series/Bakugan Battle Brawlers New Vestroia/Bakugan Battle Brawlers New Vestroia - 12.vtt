WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.274
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.809
to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.812
So we joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.582
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.852
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.621
Every battle makes us stronger and brings us

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.590
closer to our goal.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.759
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.495
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.996
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.898
We're ready to roll...

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.566
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.338
\u266a What are you going to do? \u266a

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.810
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.011
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.813
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.181
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.949
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:53.453
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.422
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.126
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.031
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.701
RUNO: Are you serious?

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.471
You mean that weirdo in the chicken suit

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.040
who grabbed me is the leader of the Vexos?

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.610
Next time I run into him, I'll pluck his feathers.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.246
And serve him for dinner!

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.082
We Vestals shouldn't have moved to New Vestroia in

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.485
the first place.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.153
You can't blame yourself, Mira.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.521
You didn't know.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.589
Runo's right.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.091
Guilt is so yesterday.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.960
That Spectra's got us all amped up...

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.929
Can we just forget about him for a minute?

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.333
THINKING: I wish I could forget.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.001
But I've got to know if my brother Keith

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:45.939
is underneath the mask of my worst enemy...

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.308
KATO: Attention passengers...

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.878
Please fasten your seat belts and prepare for landing...

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.581
Thanks so much for choosing to fly Air Marucho.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.015
Your sky buddy.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.116
BARON: Coool!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.619
We're going to rock the house at Master Dan's!

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.020
Woooohooooo!

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.022
DAN: Dude, you need to calm down.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.263
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Unmasked\".

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.175
[phone rings]

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.843
Hi, Miyoko here...

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:25.111
Dan?

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.246
Are you back?

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.313
Yeah, Mom...

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.115
Sorry, I got hung up.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.050
Dan, you know the rules...

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.319
Always call if you're going to be late.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.487
We're going, Dan!

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.522
Yes!

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.390
Wait! We can talk later.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.459
I'm bringing friends over... Bye.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.827
What? How many?

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.365
DAN: Since we can't get back to New Vestroia

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.367
till the Dimensional Transporter is back up,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.069
we need to keep training and stay sharp.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.404
JULIE: You okay, Baron?

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.573
BARON: I am awesome!

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.208
Wow!

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.143
Whoa!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.745
DAN: Dial it down, Baron.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.179
You're gonna strain something.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.247
Hey Dan?

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.415
What's with Mira?

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.884
She looks kinda spaced out.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.254
I don't know.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.589
No big deal...

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.658
She's probably stressing about her brother.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.726
It's her favourite thing to do.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.629
She's our leader and all, but she'd be a lot cooler

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.898
if she wasn't so intense.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.267
If I worried about as many things as she does,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.735
my head would explode.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.971
The only thing Dan ever thinks about is brawling.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.206
Twenty four/seven...

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.676
He's all... Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.878
She's got your number!

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.246
So what?

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.248
That's what gives me my brawling edge!

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.051
Dan sure is passionate about brawling.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.652
You've got that right.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.655
So... what's the deal with him and Runo?

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.490
Huh? Ooooh...

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.059
Man, who knows?

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.327
They're together.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.328
They're not.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.996
They're soooo dramatic.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.865
Dan's kind of my hero too.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.500
He saved the whole planet, you know.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.735
THINKING: Hero, huh?

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.104
I just don't always share my big ideas.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.975
THINKING: My hero was always my brother.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.611
And I guess he always will be.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:10.883
Whoa!

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.585
What is that thing?

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.088
Uuuuh, you mean the roller coaster?

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.124
We don't have anything like that back on Vestal.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.093
But where does it go, Master Dan?

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.160
Go?

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.363
It's a ride that's designed to make you feel

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.365
sick and dizzy...

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.033
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.568
That sounds sick...

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.703
I mean good sick!

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.405
MIRA: We've been working hard, Dan.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.207
It's time to kick back a little.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.075
Okay... Why not?

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.245
What could happen to us here?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.680
Aaaarr Matey!

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.016
Welcome aboard all you landlubbers!

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:44.083
Step up!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.985
Hit the bullseye! Win a prize!

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.321
This place is so cool.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.023
Can we live here?

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.090
Look!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.592
That whole family's green.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.926
Technicolour yawn!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.094
Are you kidding?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.629
This is disgusting.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.633
So many humans. Wow.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.802
Come on! The roller coaster's this way!

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.438
Hey... Where'd the others go?

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.539
Beats me.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.242
This means no roller coaster?

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:10.376
Just great...

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.679
So how are we going to find them in this crowd?

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.416
So.. Whatcha wanna do?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.485
Let's ride the Spine Smasher!

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.520
Oh brother.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.188
Haven't the two of you had enough of these

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.090
juvenile pastimes?

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.291
Oh wow!

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:28.127
Dan and Runo of the Battle Brawlers!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.630
Looks like we've got fans.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.698
It's me!

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:32.965
Brandon!

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.300
Don't you remember?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.571
My friends and I joined you guys

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:39.972
for the fight against Naga

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.676
when he tried to take over the world.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.113
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.515
We blew Naga away!

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.051
Put her there, Brandon.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.620
Maybe we can brawl together another time.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.656
I'll have to ask my mom.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:03.362
You don't think Dan and the others ditched us, do you?

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.931
Naaah.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:08.201
They probably got distracted by something shiny.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.069
Wow everyone looks so happy.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.538
The fight to free the Bakugan seems unreal.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.976
Okay... then let's join them.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.351
Where... are we?

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:27.553
On Earth...

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.789
I took precautions.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:33.860
We still have unfinished business with Dan Kuso.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.297
Where's the Twist-N'-Hurl?

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.767
We're walking in circles...

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.940
It can't be!

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.442
What?

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.676
Mira?

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.950
Mommy, look!

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.552
Who are those guys?

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.155
I think they're a boy band.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:03.556
'Scuze me!

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.724
Hey!

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.725
Hey!

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.994
It couldn't be them.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:12.098
Is there something wrong?

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:13.766
Sorry, Julie.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.870
Again with the running?

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.416
Slow down, Mira...

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.751
What's going on?

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.152
Spectra!

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.054
Oh boy...

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.995
Aren't you guys hot in those coats?

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.463
We meet again.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.798
But how?

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:48.634
We transported both of you back to New Vestroia.

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.470
Want to know how?

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.606
We were able to triangulate on Dan Kuso's

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.908
gauntlet and redirect our transporter gate

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.276
to his location.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.744
And presto!

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.379
Here we are.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.914
So what do you want this time?

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.783
As I said...

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.651
I want you all to join me.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.520
You know my answer.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.021
Don't be foolish.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.223
We both want

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.658
to destroy the man who's holding the Bakugan.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:16.495
Prince Hydron is the true villain here.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.030
A real prince?

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:19.165
How do we know...

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.367
that you're telling us the truth?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.470
Everyone knows you're Prince Hydron's stooge.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.373
I only infiltrated Prince Hydron's Inner Circle...

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.642
to find the truth.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.676
Wow.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.112
Keep your friends close...

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:37.083
and keep your enemies even closer.

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.619
Keith?

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:41.120
Who's Keith?

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:44.023
It's you! Isn't it?

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.791
You've got to tell me!

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:49.128
Tell me or I'll wipe that smile off your face!

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:50.830
Why won't you answer?

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.101
[angered groan]

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:58.004
You want to keep playing your little games?

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.539
Okay then.

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.474
I challenge you to a brawl...

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.542
And if I win you have to...

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.077
Take off that mask!

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.245
No way!

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.713
Very well...

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:08.714
I accept...

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.683
your challenge.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.118
However...

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.986
If I win you will join me and the Vexos

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.855
against Prince Hydron.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.591
Okay fine...

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:19.692
You've got a deal.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.194
One other condition...

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.829
You will battle me.

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:25.932
But that's not what I agreed to!

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.500
Cheater!

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.868
Too bad!

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.703
Master Spectra doesn't waste his skills

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:33.105
on a lightweight like you...

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.607
You want to battle him?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.342
You have to go through me.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.810
You should thank me.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.378
There's no way you'd even come close

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.948
to beating New Vestroia's number one Brawler.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:45.584
At least this way you have a chance, right?

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.420
So it's settled then...

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.623
You will battle Gus in my stead.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.624
Okay then...

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:52.825
But stick around.

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:55.795
As soon as I win, I 'm taking that mask off.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.029
Gauntlet...

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.965
Power Strike!

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:01.067
You go, girl!

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.536
Brawls are different on Earth, but I'll help you.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.738
Subterra battlers should stick together!

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:06.806
Okay!

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:08.975
Let's brawl!

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.746
There's more brawling after this!

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.451
It's time for the takedown!

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.653
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.389
Stop stalling and start brawling!

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.557
That's tough talk...

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.825
Mira.

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.760
Gate card open.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.232
Let's do it, Vulcan...

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.301
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:42.008
I do not know this land

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.610
but I'm sure it will give me strength!

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:46.312
We'll see about that.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:49.281
Subterra Wilda, you're up! Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.050
Bakugan Stand!

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.223
Oh no!

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.892
I didn't think Vulcan's Power Level would be so high.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.360
JULIE: No worries, Mira!

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.329
We know something they don't know!

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:04.663
MIRA: We do?

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.831
Trust me!

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.501
Gus and that Viking dude won't know what hit them.

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.269
As long as you have the land on your side,

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:11.804
you're unbeatable!

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:12.838
I don't get it.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:14.073
Hello?

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.641
Believing in Wilda and the power of Subterra gives

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:17.743
you both extra strength!

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:20.379
Sounds good to me...

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.580
Let's do this.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.149
Don't worry.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.217
Those guys look like they spend more time on their

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.286
hair than they do on strategy.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.455
Show them your power, Gus.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:31.257
No problem.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.125
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:37.063
Ability Activate! Titan Knuckle!

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.699
Nothing can beat Vulcan's sheer power.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.234
Especially when he's taking that power

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.269
from Wilda!

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.772
Ability Activate!

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:47.807
Gun Lock!

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.108
Lock and load!

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.776
MIRA: Aw, come on!

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:51.911
It's not enough!

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:55.014
Mira!

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.148
Are you even listening?

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:58.017
Later!

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.188
An impressive opening, Gus.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.490
... You taught me...

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:06.292
Ability Activate!

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:08.728
Screw jolt!

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.831
This is gonna hurt.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.866
It's going to wipe you out!

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.801
Wait! Not that card...

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.403
Mira.

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.605
You've got to think like a Subterra...

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:20.806
'Kay!

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.808
What are they up to?

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.077
Those fists can't hurt Wilda...

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.513
if they can't hit him, right?

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:29.515
Oooh! I follow.

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:33.018
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.820
Ability Activate!

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.356
Clay Wall!

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:46.365
So much for your Vulcan's extra power, Gus!

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.734
Drill your way through this!

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.639
Yes!

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.774
Nice work, blocking those punches, Wilda.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:59.645
Looks like someone could use a hand.

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.781
Laugh while you can.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.483
One trick is not enough to win a battle...

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:07.620
Or is it, Gus?

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:09.655
We shall see...

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.423
Vulcan!

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.958
Titan Knuckle!

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:14.660
JULIE: This guy's a broken record.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.061
His skin looks dry...

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.831
I think it's time we gave Vulcan a mud bath.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.466
Me too!

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.002
This ought to wipe out his ability.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.737
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.338
Ability Activate!

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.140
Sand Beast!

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:36.916
Talk about a hole in one!

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.717
This isn't a brawl!

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:39.885
It's a joke!

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:41.020
And now...

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.087
the punchline!

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.088
Okay!

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.456
Ability Activate.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.192
Quicksand Hole!

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.499
Now you're really going down!

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:56.569
On no!

00:13:56.602 --> 00:14:00.172
Time to sink or swim, Gus.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.243
GAUNTLET: Vulcan: minus two zero zero.

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:06.011
No one laughs at me...

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:11.083
I summon Bakugan Trap Hexados!

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.654
Now it's my turn to play!

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.122
Here's my game!

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.958
Ability Activate!

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.126
Land Twist!

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.736
Let him go!

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:32.071
GUS: What's the matter?

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.039
Don't you like my little squeeze play?

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.277
Hang on, Wilda!

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.345
You are so done!

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.379
Wrong!

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.814
We've got you now!

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.048
Mira!

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.451
Don't you think it's time to heat this battle up?

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.319
Wilda, you ready?

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.954
Do it!

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:50.456
Okay!

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:52.958
Ability Activate!

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.693
Molten Rock!

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.031
What now?

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:03.535
I'm just getting warmed up!

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.770
Nice, Wilda!

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:06.705
He's hot! You're not!

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.574
And you've had your last shot!

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.020
Come on!

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:24.290
He's burning away Vulcan and Hexados' power levels.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.398
You should have stayed in bed this morning, Gus!

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.569
MIRA: I'm going to win Spectra...

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.839
And then we'll see who is behind the mask!

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:43.475
She is right, Master Spectra...

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:46.345
But I won't underestimate her again...

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:47.579
Oh Please....

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.982
You can try all you want...

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:50.983
But I've got...

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.284
Wilda and...

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.485
Julie...

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.288
and the earth itself on my side!

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.991
Gate Card Open!

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.226
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.529
Wilda Stand!

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.532
Ready for round two!

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.933
Vulcan!

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:10.703
Show them what a real Subterra can do!

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.839
Time to get schooled!

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.574
Now, Ability Activate!

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.009
Titan Knuckle!

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.644
Ability Activate!

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:19.978
Clay Wall!

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:30.089
Some people never learn...

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.891
Ability Activate!

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.293
Heavy Aegis!

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.061
Take these for a spin!

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:37.963
Oh no! Wilda!

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:40.332
No Clay Wall will stop those things!

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.301
GAUNTLET: Wilda, Minus 200.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.269
Vulcan, plus 400.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.838
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.806
blow your wall down!

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.974
Wilda!

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:56.281
We know your strategy now.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.483
We'll see...

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.917
How 'bout a taste of your own...

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.352
medicine?

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.554
Subterra Bakugan Trap...

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.189
Baliton!

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.791
Ability Activate!

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.360
Flai Roller!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.398
Wanna play rough?

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.532
Fine by me.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.001
Wilda, go!

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:20.472
Double your trouble!

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.207
GAUNTLET: Increase 200!

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.375
You think you've won?

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.844
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set!

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.579
Ability Activate!

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.615
Viblow!

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.422
JULIE: Mira!

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.856
Watch out!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.794
Now you'll see why Vulcan is king of the ring!

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:50.903
They demolished us.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:52.704
GUS: One more and you're going down!

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.772
Don't worry.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:54.873
I will make this quick!

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.975
Gate Card Open!

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.381
Rise, Vulcan!

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.783
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.919
Let's go, Wilda!

00:18:06.952 --> 00:18:09.788
And Bakugan Trap, Baliton!

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.690
Ability Activate!

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.258
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.961
Apollon Head!

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:18.964
Who's on the ropes now?

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:22.167
JULIE: Let's wrap this up, Mira.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.203
Right, Julie!

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.537
Ability Activate!

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.139
Iron Plate!

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:32.344
Careful, Gus.

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.379
She's not giving up.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.481
That's good...

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.116
It makes winning sweeter...

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:38.784
Go Hexados!

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:42.621
Take this brawl underground!

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.156
Not so fast!

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.691
Ability Activate!

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:47.126
Ground Detonator!

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.334
You've got serious hang-ups!

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:57.035
In that case I'll win...

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.804
with double attacks!

00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:01.773
Double Ability Activate!

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.509
Titan Knuckle plus...

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.011
Screw Impact!

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:09.414
Numbers don't lie...

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:12.885
...The victory is Spectra's...

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:15.420
Ready...Mira? Yeah!

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.588
What?

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:19.124
Add this up, Math Whiz!

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.260
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set!

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.195
Ability Activate...

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.130
Copycat!

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.366
Let's bring this battle home!

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.707
JULIE: Yeah! Crunch those numbers!

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:40.078
Impossible!

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:49.187
JULIE: Going, going, gone!

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.624
I'm sorry...

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.960
Master Spectra.

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:56.161
Not so fast.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:59.031
You're not backing out on the deal you made with Mira.

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:02.367
Mira won fair and square, thanks to crybaby here.

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:05.370
No master!

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.072
The loss is mine, not yours.

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.875
Don't let her unmask you!

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.610
So what do you say?

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:14.513
Are you a man of your word?

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.747
Don't do it!

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.083
Let's just leave here and go back to New Vestroia.

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.952
You sure are a sore loser.

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:22.354
I guess you Vexos really aren't trustworthy.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.356
Dan was right about guys.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.658
GUS: Master, no!

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.928
Come on... Show me your face!

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:32.230
A promise

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.498
is a promise.

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:37.069
Maybe this will prove I'm a friend to the Bakugan...

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:39.471
...and something more to you.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.511
MIRA: It is you...

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.914
Keith!

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.083
But why?

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.390
Who is it?

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:01.660
MIRA: That's my greatest enemy.

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:05.397
And... ...my brother.

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.003
Hey Brawlers, Ace here.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.738
Things are hopping back on New Vestroia.

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.673
When Drago went back to Earth he took the power

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.908
of the Perfect Core with him...

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.910
...and now the remaining Dimension Controllers

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.779
are stronger than ever!

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:23.749
Shun, Marucho and I try to go it alone but end up

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.817
walking into a Vexos trap!

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:28.453
I hope Dan and the others get back soon,

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:31.089
because we're going to need all the help we can get!

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.991
This is for Mira!

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.760
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.229
It's sink or swim, next time on Bakugan!
