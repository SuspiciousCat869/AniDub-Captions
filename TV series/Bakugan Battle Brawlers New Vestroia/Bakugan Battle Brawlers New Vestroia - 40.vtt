DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.878
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.447
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.283
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.386
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.755
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.857
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.126
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.628
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.830
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.732
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.000

PRINCE HYDRON: Why waste energy?

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:53.660
Father, there's no point running around after the

PRINCE HYDRON: If you're so impatient, why don't

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.320
you run along and do the job yourself, instead of

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.589
sitting here and complaining?

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.891

BARON: What? Are you serious?

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.669
SHUN: Then the field itself was a trap!

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.304
VOLT: The only thing that's going to decide the

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:22.808
battle in here are the Bakugan's original base power levels.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:23.909
Which means...

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.277
MARUCHO: Our Bakugan's power levels aren't as

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.813
high as the Mechanical Bakugans'...

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.047
SHADOW PROVE: Yeah! That's right.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:32.217
So there's no way you can win! Kick it, MAC Spider!

GAUNTLET: Ace and Marucho Life force, zero.

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.907
ACE: [grunt] Percival!

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.843
VOLT: I think it's time...for my finishing move...

00:17:57.876 --> 00:18:00.045
Double ability, activate!

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.415

GAUNTLET: Shun and Baron Life force, zero.

MYLENE: Hmmph.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:30.309
If you play with fire, you get burned, Brawlers.

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.010
Well, you were foolish to ever think that you could

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.379
take us in our own home.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:38.117

[\u266a]

BARON/SHUN: [running, exertion]

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.074
BARON: Man! Where did those guys disappear to?

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.243
INGRAM: Sorry, I failed to protect the attribute

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:07.713
energy that was entrusted to me by the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.349
NEMUS: Don't worry, Ingram. We're not finished yet.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:13.652
We still have the Darkus and Pyrus energies.

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:16.989
BARON: Yeah, the BT System is still two powers away

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.423
from being fully functional.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.259
And we'll have to keep it that way.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:23.195
SHUN: Mmmmhmmm. Which is why we need to destroy the

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:25.697
BT System immediately.

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:27.266
ACE: Shun! Baron!

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.768
BARON: Hey guys. We've got some bad news.

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:32.104
MARUCHO: Unfortunately, so do we.

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:35.040
They took the Darkus Energy from us Baron.

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:37.509
ACE: I'm guessing by the look on your face they

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:40.012
took the Ventus Energy from you as well.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:41.146
Am I right?

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:43.448
BARON: [gasp] That's terrible!

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:47.386
SHUN: That means the only one left is Drago's Pyrus energy...

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:49.821
MARUCHO: We've gotta find Dan and Mira now!

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:50.889
BARON: Yeah.

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.457
ACE: [gasp] Hmmm

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.194
DAN: Where the heck does this hall lead to, anyway?

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:56.361
MIRA: Dan! Look there!

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.433

PRINCE HYDRON: Let me guess...

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.709
you saved the best for last.

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.344
MIRA: Hydron?

DAN: What d'you want? Tell us!

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:18.216
PRINCE HYDRON: Now that you ask, the Pyrus Energy

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.618
would be nice.

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.420

SPECTRA: The end, huh?

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:34.733
PROFESSOR CLAY: Huh? !

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.868
SPECTRA: Sorry to startle you, Professor.

SHUN: Dan! Where are you? !

MARUCHO: You can't battle the Mechanical Bakugan

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:47.412
inside the Palace!

SPECTRA: Since my re-birth as Spectra:, my sole

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:13.105
purpose has been to create the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:15.641
Zenoheld's BT System stands in the way of my

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:18.677
achieving this...So I'm must thwart his plans.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.278
SPECTRA: In order to ensure that he doesn't get

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.714
the final attribute energy that's required to power

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:26.585
his machine, I will fight alongside Dan Kuso.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:28.553
And in the process I'll also be able to avenge my

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.656
loyal friend Gus.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.991
