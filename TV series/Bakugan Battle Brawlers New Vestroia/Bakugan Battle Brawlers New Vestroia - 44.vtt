WEBVTT

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.410
SPECTRA: It was just before we joined the

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.212
Battle Brawlers at the Mother Palace that we

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.915
received a rogue transmission containing phantom data.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.318
GUS: Master Spectra?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.519
GUS: Is that?

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.055
SPECTRA: Look at this. How very interesting.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.391
SPECTRA: It seems that the only chance Helios has to

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.127
defeat Drago is to evolve at a faster rate than

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.063
him...This phantom data may provide us with the

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.332
key to do that.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.167
GUS: That's incredible, sir.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.435
SPECTRA: It is, isn't it? !

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.574
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.610
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:44.811
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.613
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.047
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.883
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.251
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.286
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.821
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.959
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.929
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.364
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.934
[\u266a]

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.070
SPECTRA: Gus. Come look at this.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.672
[\u266a]

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.074
GUS: You did it, sir.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:25.385
[\u266a]

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.588
SPECTRA: It's time. We can finally execute our plan to make

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.224
you the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.792
HELIOS: Finally.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.527
SPECTRA: Get ready, Dan...The final

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.530
battle...will soon be upon you!

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.169
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.604
Spectra's Last Stand.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.143
DAN: I still have no clue where those Bakugan came from.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.544
DAN: It's just so weird.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.913
BARON: The one I fought was crazy strong.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.915
DAN: No kidding.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.984
NEMUS: I've taken some hard hits before but that

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.653
was unlike anything I've ever encountered.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.388
ACE: I don't like this, guys.

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.458
There's just too many question marks involved in this.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.060
PERCIVAL: I'm with Ace.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.661
SHUN: Those Bakugan have to be connected to the

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.365
Phantom Data somehow...and I think Helios' Battle

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.367
gear probably is too.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.768
INGRAM: But how can we be sure?

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.204
MARUCHO: My team is analyzing the data as fast

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.740
as they can but ...it's heavily encrypted so it's

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.876
going to take a lot of time.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.245
ELFIN: Oh, I just love a good mystery.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.379
PREYAS: Are you for real?

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.547
RUNO: Maybe we should chill.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.782
We don't know that they're our enemies.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.551
TIGRERRA: Runo has a point.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.752
JULIE: Why would they hurt us?

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.354
We just destroyed the BT System.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.623
GOREM: Our people should finally be at peace.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.492
MIRA: Well, let's hope that's truly the case.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.761
WILLDA: For all of our sakes.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.474
HELIOS: There will be no more distractions.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.911
No more rescue missions or confused agendas.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:02.215
In my next battle with Drago I will be victorious.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.449
SPECTRA: It's good to see you haven't lost your

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.552
fire, Helios.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.455
HELIOS: It burns hotter than ever, Spectra.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.595
WILLDA: There's nothing more you could do, Mira.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.863
JULIE: What's wrong, girl?

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:20.533
RUNO: Yeah, Mira. Talk to us. We're here for you.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.868
MIRA: No, it's nothing.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:25.171
I was just thinking about the Phantom Data.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.473
Listen, lets do something fun for a change.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.143
Anyone up for bowling? What d'ya say?

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.579
ACE: Quit pretending.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:33.613
ACE: You're wondering...

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.649
ACE: ...where Spectra is, just like us.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:40.320
MIRA: Actually Ace, you're wrong.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.623
Keith is nothing more than a distant memory to me now.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.391
And I've laid him to rest.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.626
For good.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.862
RUNO: Mira...

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:50.964
DAN: Hey Mira...

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.098
MIRA: Huh?

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.333
DAN: There's something...that I think

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.434
I should tell you.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.535
MIRA: Uh huh?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.869
DAN: Spectra may be dead to you, but I'm not ready

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.171
to give up on him yet.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.607
I'm convinced he could be a great addition to the team.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.476
DAN: And I'll tell him that, if we ever see him again.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.345
Believe it.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:09.148
MIRA: Dan...I'm glad...you're still

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.451
optimistic about Keith.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.819
I hope you're right and that maybe one day he'll

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.687
still come around.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.091
DAN: I love Tuesdays...Cos it's Taco night!

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.260
I love Tuesdays...Cos it's Taco night!

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.529
BARON: I really like tacos too but...

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:24.831
ACE: So annoying.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.367
DAN: Awww! Gimme a break. I'm totally starving.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.468
DAN: Huh?

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.169
SPECTRA: Dan Kuso.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.304
DAN: [gasp]

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:32.939
SPECTRA: Can you hear me, Dan?

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:36.409
DAN: Spectra?

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.012
[\u266a]

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.148
SPECTRA: It's time, Dan...Let's battle.

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.550
DAN: What do you mean?

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:47.220
Where are you?! Show yourself!

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.855
ACE: Come on Spectra?

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.057
SHUN: I think he's speaking to Dan telepathically.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.425
That's why we can't hear him.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.161
DAN: Tell me why you want to battle!

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.863
SPECTRA: It's time to finalize my creation of

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.532
the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.100
DAN: Are you still going on about that crazy plan

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.869
of yours?!

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.104
DAN: There's been enough fighting, Spectra.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.372
It's time for peace!

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.607
PREYAS: Who's Dan yelling at?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.775
ELFIN: Yeah! What's going on?!

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:09.842
MARUCHO: Um...Dan?

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.444
MIRA: Ace, what is it?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.746
ACE: Spectra's communicating with Dan.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.847
MIRA: Huh?

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.049
DAN: Now Taco Night's ruined!

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:20.520
[\u266a]

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.622
DAN: Drago!

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.657
DRAGO: Helios! Can you hear me?!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.326
HELIOS: I hear you, Drago.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.196
SPECTRA: The time for talking is over.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.632
Let the final battle begin now.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.568
HELIOS: I'm ready to realize my dream.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:36.803
DAN: You want a final battle?

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.772
You got it, but this time you won't be walking away.

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.140
DRAGO: Dan...your grip...

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.308
DAN: Oh, sorry pal.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.310
SPECTRA: Are you ready or not, Dan?

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:45.678
DAN: Yah! More than ready.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.580
DAN: Let's do this Spectra!

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.015
MIRA: Dan!

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.149
RUNO: No... Don't do it.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.551
JULIE: Spectra abandoned you.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.153
MARUCHO: You don't owe him the satisfaction of a final battle.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.388
DAN: Don't care.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.357
DRAGO: They won't leave us alone until we finish this.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.357
INGRAM: Be careful friend.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.425
PERCIVAL: Good luck.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.627
BARON: Stop it guys. You're freaking me out!

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:02.929
ACE: We still don't know if he's connected to the

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.263
Phantom Data.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.398
SHUN: Calm down, Dan.

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:07.500
You're letting your emotions get the best of you.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.535
MARUCHO: Yah... I agree with Ace.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.803
Why don't' you take a bit of time to think

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:11.871
this thing through?

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.039
DAN: Forget it.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:14.207
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.409
DAN: Don't need to...I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.544
MIRA: Please don't do it.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.148
DAN: I'm sorry...but I have to...what do you say, Drago?

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:25.151
You ready to show these clowns who the boss is?

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:26.486
DRAGO: Absolutely.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.020
MIRA: Then I'm going too.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.589
JULIE: Yeah, me too!

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.557
RUNO: I guess...you guys can count me in.

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:33.960
ACE: Why should you get to have all the fun, Dan.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.895
PERCIVAL: Yeah, we at least wanna watch!

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.096
MARUCHO: Let's go!

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.699
BARON: We're right behind you...Master Dan!

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.067
SHUN: Mmmmhmmm!

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.302
DAN: Alright! Looks like we're traveling as a team then.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.337
Okay Drago!

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.371
DRAGO: Leave it to me!

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.707
[\u266a]

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.610
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion]

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:58.751
[\u266a]

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.487
DRAGO: I've found him.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:08.394
[\u266a]

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.363
SPECTRA: I see you've brought an army.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.598
Am I fighting your whole crew, Dan?

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.833
DAN: Nope, just me.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:17.003
