WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.609
Not long after we freed New Vestroia, King

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.578
Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.247
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.217
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.319
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.821
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.923
But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and transferred

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.092
their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.294
Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.697
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.632
The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands and the

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.767
stakes are high.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.468
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:45.545
[\u266a]

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:55.188
[\u266a]

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.102
[\u266a]

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.105
This waiting is making me restless.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.674
We may not have all six of the attribute energies

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.677
yet, but I feel like taking the BT system out

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.979
for a test drive...

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.116
And I think I know just the place to do it.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.219
[maniacal laughter]

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:35.462
[\u266a]

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.298
[Low, startled roar]

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.535
It's wonderful to see how quickly things have

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.172
returned to normal, after we were freed from the Vestals.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.708
[squeakS]

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.184
What is this metal beast?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.291
[\u266a]

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.393
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: The Day New

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.928
Vestroia Stood Still.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.869
Dude, are you kidding me?

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.538
You've had this thing the whole time and you didn't tell us?

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.807
Yeah, Marucho. What's up with that, huh?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.142
Quiet guys. Let him concentrate.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.311
Here we go. This should do it.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.883
Good afternoon to you, my fellow Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.184
Hey Klaus, how are you, man?

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.218
It's been so long.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.953
I see that living on Vestal hasn't affected

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.188
your sense of style.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.290
Still rocking the 16th Century pirate thing.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.458
Well Dan...

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.226
Thanks for the compliment, but we've more pressing

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.761
issues to discuss.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.029
Guys, you've gotta help us.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.097
They've come back!

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.432
Hydron and his posse of Vexos scum!

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.034
You can't be serious!

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.736
I'm so sorry Master Dan...

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.540
Hydron ambushed us in the park and he took the Haos Energy.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.108
Just don't beat yourself up, Baron.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.376
They're stronger now.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.711
If Klaus and Sirenoid hadn't stepped in, Mylene

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.880
would've taken my Darkus energy too.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.416
So it looks like the Vexos are calling us out?

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.184
Just like the Ancients said, they're after our

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.921
six attribute energies with the BT System.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.455
And now that they've got the Haos Energy, they're

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.257
one step closer to activating it.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.394
At least they don't have the element of surprise anymore.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.396
We know what we've gotta do...Time for us to go to

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.731
Vestal and face these Vexos clowns head

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:22.268
on...It's time we shut them down for good.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.837
[Ad-libbed words of agreement]

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.005
Don't worry guys.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.540
Julie and I can hold down the fort just like before.

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:30.143
Yeah, we're old pros at it now!

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.344
Hmmm.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.512
All right, then.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.613
Next stop: Vestal!

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.482
[Ad-libbed words of encouragement]

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:42.322
[\u266a]

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.590
No pressure, Doc.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.091
But we're counting on you.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.727
You gotta get us all to Vestal in one piece.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.928
Yes, I understand.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.129
You'll be fine.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.331
This isn't a slingshot, you know.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.565
Be careful when you get there, okay?

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.001
Don't worry. We're the best, remember?

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.138
What's this?

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.274
The radar is picking up an atmospheric anomaly

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.309
emanating from New Vestroia.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.877
What do you think it is?

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.145
The Vexos. Who else?

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.547
But that doesn't make sense.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.948
None of the Bakugan possessing attribute

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.416
energies are there.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.052
Maybe it's a distraction to throw us off their tails.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.188
Or maybe it's another attack on our people.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.589
Elfin's right.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.724
We can't ignore it.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.225
What do you think, Dan?

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.260
I don't know ...It could be a decoy, but...it could

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.731
also be a trap to lure all of the attribute energies

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.733
to one place.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.334
Oh man!

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.069
I'll go check it out.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.372
Huh?

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.506
You made a good point.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.341
It's probably safer we split up anyway.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.410
We'll catch you later in Vestal.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.878
Are you sure?

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.081
He's fine. He's almost as tough as me.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.550
The Dimension Transporter has locked on to the coordinates.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.686
If you're going to jump now's the time to do it.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.054
You'll be fine, Shun.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.822
Just remember to hold your breath.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.425
Say hi to New Vestroia...Okay, buddy?

00:04:52.458 --> 00:05:07.373
[\u266a]

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.476
Ingram was bestowed with the Ventus Energy.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.545
It'll be one sorry Vexos who makes the mistake of

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.447
messing with him.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.582
I know that it is a great honour and responsibility

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.052
to have been given the Ventus Energy, but since

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.286
my Evolution.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.521
I don't feel right.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.723
I worry that I'm not ready for such power.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:26.926
Sensors are picking up two life forms headed for New Vestroia.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.662
They appear to be a Bakugan and a human.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:31.764
Perrrrrrrfect.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.800
Right on schedule.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:45.778
[\u266a]

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.146
This looks like New Vestroia, but where are

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.681
all the Bakugan?

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.484
Is it possible we've been transported to the wrong planet?

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.152
No we're in the right place.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.089
But even though this is my home, it seems strange to me too.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.724
What the? Ingram, what's wrong?

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.793
If we're really in New Vestroia why are you still a ball?

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.329
I was wondering the same thing myself.

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.764
It doesn't make any sense.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:08.434
We destroyed the Dimension Controller...I don't understand.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.371
The Dimension Controller is not responsible.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.272
Huh?

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:16.109
There is a new danger here.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.912
Skyress!

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:23.616
[\u266a]

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.919
I had always hoped I'd see you again...but not under

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:29.222
these circumstances.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.424
You look beautiful, Skyress.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.292
Skyress, please tell us.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:36.229
What is this new danger you speak of?

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:38.531
We're here to help you Skyress.

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.300
Tell us what happened.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.771
Earlier this morning, a strange metal sphere

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.305
appeared in the sky.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.074
A sphere?

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.710
Before any of us knew what to make of it, it had

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:54.080
embedded itself deep into the ground.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:07:06.492
[\u266a]

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.528
A beam from that did this to you?

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.762
Yes.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.031
You don't understand how painful it is, after being

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.066
enslaved to be granted freedom, only to have it

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.402
ripped away from you again.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.404
The Bakugan are a peaceful race.

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:21.007
I don't understand why this keeps happening to us.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.275
Blasted Vexos.

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:24.377
Don't you worry, Skyress.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.746
We're here...We drove these creeps out of New

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.916
Vestroia once, so there's no reason why we can't do it again.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.152
Haaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:36.289
[\u266a]

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:40.026
[yelp, pain]

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:41.994
[Grunt]

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.162
Shun!

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.430
Are you okay? What was that?

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.665
Ah! Blast!

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.367
it's an incredibly powerful electric force field.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.669
Whatever this thing is the Vexos don't

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.337
want anyone meddling with it.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.905
Cracking that shield is impossible.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.741
Blasted Vexos.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:58.945
Hmmm.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.013
You're our only hope, Shun.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.015
Without the Bakugan Battle Brawlers, we haven't got a

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.651
chance against the Vexos.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.688
She's right, Shun.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.556
There must be something we can do.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.758
Please...

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.127
Well, if we can't destroy this thing, we'll have to

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.664
figure out another way to defeat the Vexos.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.200
We can do this Ingram!

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.869
We just have to do this.

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:25.037
But how?

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:29.175
What a pity for Shun that he has you as a partner.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.177
What did you just say to me?

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.411
Hold on, Skyress...

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:36.048
No, don't defend him. Where's his fire?

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.550
Where's his courage?

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.219
These are his people that need to be saved yet he

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.488
cowers like a frightened child.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.124
How can one so weak call himself a Bakugan?

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.192
What!

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:47.493
No Skyress...

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:50.796
Forgive me, Shun, but I only speak the truth.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.766
Come on Skyress...Ingram is no coward...I trust him

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.369
with my life...we're partners.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:57.536
Shun...

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.939
I meant no disrespect, Shun...

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.875
Sorry to interrupt the reunion, kids.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.313
Don't worry, this won't take very long....I came

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.549
to retrieve the Ventus energy.

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.184
[Laughing]

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.620
Come back and watch me take the Ventus Energy

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:16.822
from Ingram. This is gonna be fun!

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.226
Lync is no match for Ingram and I.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.761
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.132
That electro-shield had to hurt, Shun.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.833
I thought you were gonna cry.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.435
Keep talking, Lync.

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.438
I demand you return the Bakugan to their natural state!

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:35.174
Oh wow...Such tough talk...Your Bakugan has a

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:37.643
lot of nerve talking to me like that.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.579
Pretty brave standing so close to the BT System.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.682
This is the BT System?

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.216
Well, a part of it anyway.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.385
If you think this looks impressive now, just wait

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.755
til we get all the attribute energies and power it up.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.758
The BT System really is a thing of beauty.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.795
There's nothing beautiful about a tool of destruction.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:59.065
Well...beautiful or not, you have to admit it's

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.299
pretty impressive.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.301
I mean, it's not fully powered yet, but it's

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:06.572
still able to emit dimension rays that trap

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:08.874
your Bakugan in ball form.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.676
[Laughter]

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.311
Come on, Shun.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.879
Why the angry face?

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:17.049
I can't wait to introduce Mechanical Aluze.

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:20.119
Only fools joke in the face of battle, Lync...

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.921
So, are you ready Ingram?

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.190
You bet!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.260
Gauntlet activated.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.729
Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:34.233
Gate Card, set!

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:39.438
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.741
Ventus Aluze, stand!

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:47.446
[\u266a]

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.117
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.787
Ventus Master Ingram, stand!

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.056
Hah!

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:58.657
Prepare to be humbled by...

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.127
Ventus Master Ingram!

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.164
Ability activate, Wind Power Extreme!

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.565
[\u266a]

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.600
Hup!

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.468
Huah!

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.803
[\u266a]

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:14.006
Hmmm...Ability activate, Giga Armour!

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.211
[\u266a]

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.746
How annoying.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.348
Double ability, activate!

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.317
Wind Echo plus Wind Split!

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.820
[Roar]

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.655
Hoh! Hah!

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.326
Hah!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.630
Okay...now, I'm reading your mail...Fusion

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.432
Ability, activate

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.533
Aero Aegis

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:41.934
[\u266a]

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:49.008
[grunts, pain]

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.843
Blast this thing!

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.678
That's why I love the Aero Aegis.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.380
It really sticks it to you.

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:57.083
Or rather you stick to it.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:58.551
Ingram!

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.985
So much for the Ventus Master Ingram.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.220
[laughter]

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.455
I...

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:05.424
I call Trap Bakugan Ventus Slash

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:16.402
[\u266a]

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.471
Thank-you, Slash.

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.139
A Trap Bakugan, eh?

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.707
That's a weak move that only an amateur would

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.277
try...Gate Card, open!

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:28.013
Forcement Wind!

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.116
With Forcement Wind, Aluze's power level goes

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:33.119
up 100 points for each Bakugan on the field with

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:34.420
the same attribute...

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:37.022
Whether they're friend or foe.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.225
No way!

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.093
And now... Ability activate!

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:43.462
Ability card, set.

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:45.698
Thunder Striper!

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.934
[Grunt, pain]

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:55.508
So Shun...have you had enough yet?

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.078
Shun, please! You must use me!

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.246
Are you sure?

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.814
Yes!

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.649
More than anything.

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.453
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.921
Bakugan Stand!

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:12.024
Ventus Storm Skyress, descend!

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.460

[whistles] That's pretty girly.

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.082
I really hate this kid.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.918
Not as much as I do.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.220
You had your chance and you failed, Ingram.

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:43.155
Now it's my turn.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.456
[groans, defeated]

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.860
Shun!

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:48.994
I've got your back.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:50.663

You think you're so cool.

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:10.849
You're not the only one with sick skills.

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.918

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:24.597
Wait, Ingram!

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.098
Had enough humiliation?

He's toast!

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.382
Give it up, man!

No. Ingram!

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.527
Is he okay?

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.997
Shun!

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.665

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:15.681
Whatever, dude...No big deal.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:17.616
One more round and your precious Ventus energy is

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.251
mine anyway.

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.687
Are you okay, Ingram?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.189
I'm so sorry, Shun.

00:15:24.223 --> 00:15:26.225
I've fought a clumsy battle today and because

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:29.995
of me, the Vestals might still win the Ventus Energy.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.430
It's these new powers.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:33.432
I'm not sure that I'm worthy of them, or even

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.833
ready to use them.

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:37.336
This evolution has me so confused.

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:39.505
Many would consider it a blessing but I think it's

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.073
a curse.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.675
Ingram...

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.411
Withdraw yourself from the rest of the battle...

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.514
You are nothing but a detriment to us at this point.

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.715
What?

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.984
In battle your head cannot be clouded, especially not

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.153
with self doubt.

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.521
Come on, Shun.

She's right.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.961
Ingram's too unsure of right now, and Lync is too

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.164
strong a competitor.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.576
[Gasps, pain]

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.677
This is ridiculous.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.746
I must embrace my new powers.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.348
[Screams]

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.916
I will not run from battle.

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:33.685
I will fight...for Shun, for Skyress, for me and

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.888
all Bakugan!

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.025
Send me in, Shun!

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.360
But Ingram...

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:43.295
I won't lose to the Vexos.

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.297
I will not let them defeat me!

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.434
Alright...only if you're sure.

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:50.669
I am!

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.037
Ingram...

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.039
Let's take the fight to them!

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:56.308

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.746
[\u266a]

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.147
Hah! Ho!

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.516
Ventus Master Ingram

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.985
Has returned!

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:09.321
Yeah, yeah...you're a tough guy...you know I've

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.590
heard this all before.

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:13.058
Ability activate!

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.526

[\u266a]

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:24.336
You will not take this energy from me, boy!

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.205
Whoa, he's mad.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:29.041
[grunt] Activate Shadow Wing!

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:36.415
[\u266a]

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.716
Shadow Wing.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.551
I don't know that, it must be part of his...

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.753
...New Attribute Energy Powers.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.255
Oh man!

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.891

Haaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.516
[\u266a]

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.120
Alright, you wanna fight?

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.388
See how you like this.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:17.990

[exertion]

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.930
What? How'd he do that?

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:30.869
[mighty battle cry]

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:38.076
[\u266a]

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.681
Yeah...well...took your three Bakugan to beat my one.

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:44.082
Who cares?

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:47.019
In the end, we still have the Ventus Energy and you don't.

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:50.355
Your arrogance was no match for our will to win!

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.423
Will to win?

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:54.459
I'll show you idiots the will to win!

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.762
Next time you see me coming you better run the

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:57.829
other way!

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:02.334
Shun...Ingram...Thank you.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:04.469
Well, we may not have destroyed it, but at least

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.972
we delayed the launch of the BT System.

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:09.007
Shun, I owe you an apology.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.443
I hope my self doubt hasn't given you reason to

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:12.611
doubt me as well.

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:13.612
Huh?

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:14.646
And Skyress...

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.914
Skyress?

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:21.119
I'm glad I don't have to worry about you anymore, Ingram.

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.220
Skyress?

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.289
Now that you believe in yourself.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.693
The Ancients chose you to bestow their powers upon

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:28.961
for a reason.

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:30.329
Never forget that.

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:33.599
I won't and I have you to thank for that, Skyress.

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:35.667
You and Shun make a good team.

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.102
Take care of each other.

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:38.103
We will.

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.705
I promise.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.474
It was so wonderful to see you both again, even

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.876
though it was for the last time.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.278
Good-bye Shun.

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:49.381
Good-bye Ingram.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:51.383
Good-bye Skyress.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:54.586
We'll miss you.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:01.927
Skyyyyyyreeeeesssss!

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.102
[\u266a]

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.470
We finally made our way through the Dimension

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.972
Transporter to Vestal and found Klaus waiting for us.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.974
But he wasn't the only one there to greet us.

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.243
Volt showed up and challenged us to a battle,

00:21:18.276 --> 00:21:20.612
then Spectra and Gus appeared out of nowhere.

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.848
Pretty soon it was a full on Vexos party.

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:25.283
Only we weren't really in the mood to celebrate.

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:26.852
Come to think of it neither were they.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:29.221
We're talking serious crazy time.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.857
Tune in next time to check it out for yourself.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.125
Time to throw down, Drago.

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:34.293
Bakugan, brawl!

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.761
Rock on, Brawlers!

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:47.039
[\u266a]

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:56.682
