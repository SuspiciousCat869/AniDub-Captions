00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.209
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.778
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.581
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.584
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:21.154
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.890
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.293
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.262
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.663
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.532
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:45.612
[\u266a]

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:55.255
[\u266a]

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.338
This is unacceptable!

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.573
My orders were clear...

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.943
Spectra knew the Mechanical Bakugan were for my use...

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.578
There's nothing to worry about.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.712
Spectra.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.614
Prince Hydron.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.782
There you are.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.452
I simply gave your Bakugan to Mira and Gus to test

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:26.853
them for you.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.289
Besides, if the Battle Brawlers are defeated then

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:33.493
they're not worth your time, are they, my Prince?

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.295
I suppose... you're right...

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.565
I guess I can trust your judgment, this time.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.534
Fool.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.773
It is time... Mira.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:53.980
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Wall To Wall Brawl!\"

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.785
Mira...

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.119
What are you doing here?

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.254
You're really going to turn your back on the

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.289
Bakugan and your friends?

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.825
I'm a Bakugan brawler, Dan...

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.328
I have to honour what the battle decides.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.797
Spectra won fair and square...

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.031
I'm now with him.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.032
Mira...

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.134
Are you kidding?

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:15.268
You lose a match...

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.905
and suddenly you abandon everything you care about?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.340
Was everything you told me...

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.442
about the Resistance a lie?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.710
I trusted you!

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.345
Calm down, Ace...

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.081
It was you Mira You're the one who taught me to hear

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.350
their voices ... You convinced me the stakes

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:32.652
were too high to ignore...How can you throw

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.787
all that all away like it's nothing...

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.855
Mira?

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.056
That's over now...

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.591
I promised my brother I'd stop you...

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.527
So if you want to go any further...

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.530
You and Dan will have to get through me...

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.764
From now on I brawl...

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.065
for the Vexos!

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.100
What?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.070
No way... Mira...

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.372
Just drop it.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.677
I won't let anyone stop us from rescuing the Bakugan.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.712
Not even you, Mira...

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.347
Not ever!

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.317
That's it...

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.685
No more talk... Right, Dan?

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.886
Right, Ace.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.987
Okay...

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.822
It's time to show this traitor.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.957
You heard him...

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.892
Now bring it on!

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:15.128
Anything to stop Ace's whining.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.732

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.135
What's that?

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.836
Don't know... Don't care...

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.705
The Resistance is over.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.373

Yes Dan I'm fine. However Mira is a formidable opponent.

It's taking everything I've got...

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:42.394

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.595
Ability Card Set.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.130
Ability Activate!

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.999
Misty Shadow!

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.367
Go Falcon Fly!

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:19.772
[\u266a]

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:22.274
If the Dimension Controller is below us...

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:24.476
This battle could work to our advantage.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.844
Uh well... Yeah...

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.046
It should be but what's the big deal?

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.314
I've got a feeling...

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:32.451
If Dan and Ace keep upping the energy, this battle

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:35.020
could overload the Gamma Controller just like we

00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:38.090
did with the Alpha and Beta Controllers.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.458
Sounds good.

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.627
And... once it explodes, it could mean...

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.196
we'll defeat the Vexos once and for all.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:45.564
Now Dan... You're up.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:46.632
Got it!

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:49.101
Double Ability Activate!

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:52.104
Satellite Impact!

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.839
Plus Strike Dragon!

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:57.810
[mighty battle roar]

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.819
Shut down!

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:09.688
[horrified gasp]

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.032
Nice work.

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:22.668
You too, man.

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:26.839
Whoa!

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.707
What's going on?

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:32.311
It's blowing!

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.545
Let's go!

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.792
[\u266a]

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.694
Gus must have lost too!

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.029
So much for divide and conquer...

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.731
There's nothing more we can do here...

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.032
Let's get out...

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.834
before we're buried alive.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.071
Oh well...

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.039
I guess it's all up to me now.

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:04.009
[frightened yelling]

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.511
Mira!

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:13.418
[frightened yelling]

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:21.326
Thanks, Drago!

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.129
You too, Ingram!

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:31.803
I can't believe we did it!

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.439
We destroyed the last of the Vestal's Dimension

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.807
Controllers!

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:39.178
And best of all, now all the Bakugan will be free for good!

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:41.313
Congrats... everyone!

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:44.283
I'm sorry, guys.

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.152
I'm really sorry...

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:51.290
I almost...

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.993
No sorries... OK!

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.161
It's OK.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.997
Yeah, don't worry about it Mira.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.301
Thanks...

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:04.937
You guys are the best.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.573
You had us a little worried there.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.907
But we always knew...

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.209
That in your heart you were with us.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.178
I admit I got a little scared back there...

00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.347
when I saw you battling with Dan.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.915
But you were really helping him.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.851
Yeah, at first I didn't know what you were doing...

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.653
I feel like a dork now.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:23.555
It's not hard to fool you, Dan.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:24.723
You're right.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.225
[good natured laugh]

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:27.893
I always believed in you.

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.127
I know you...

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:31.863
you'd never go back on your word.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.465
Thank you.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:38.337
Cool it... There's still one more thing to do.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.607
Next stop... the Vespalace!

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.744
I'm sorry, Master Spectra, but Mira...

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:47.112
Forget Mira...

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.614
She means nothing to me...

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:52.517
We still have the ultimate weapon.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:57.823
Let it be our little present to the Resistance

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.359
and my dear sister...

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:03.195
Mira Fermin.

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.229
[evil laugh]

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.667
Marucho here!

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.304
We defeated the Vexos but the battle's not over yet!

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.741
So now we're off to the Vespalace to free Preyas

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:18.076
and all the others!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.212
We should have known Spectra'd have other plans.

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:22.948
And it's not popcorn and a movie...

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.352
And wait till you see his ultimate weapon!

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.554
It's bad news.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:33.191
It's now or never Brawlers... let's go

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:36.061
Bakugan... Brawl....

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.396
See ya!

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:47.472
[\u266a]

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:57.115
