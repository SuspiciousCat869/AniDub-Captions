WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.409
Not long after we freed New Vestroia, King

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.578
Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.180
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.117
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.252
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.688
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.757
But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and transferred

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.925
their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.261
Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.430
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.499
The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands and the

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.600
stakes are high.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.402
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:45.478
[\u266a]

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:55.121
[\u266a]

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.601
Brontes!

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.637
Where did you find him?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.971
Why do you have Brontes?

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.307
Answer me!

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.542
Gus!

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.211
What did you do to my Brontes?

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.312
Your Brontes?

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.814
That's very funny Volt...Why do you care so

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.917
much about something that you so easily tossed away?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.486
I've modified him to better suit my purposes.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.922
Well...I don't want to sound dramatic, but I

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.926
guess in a way you could say...I took away his soul.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.829
Brontes.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.064
Why did I let Mylene do that to Brontes?

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.466
I should have protected him.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.334
[grunt]

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.869
Why so grumpy, Volt?

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.305
Still mad that Spectra cut in front of you to fight

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.506
the Brawlers?

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.640
I dunno.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.842
I think it's something more.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.710
It looks like he's gonna cry.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.911
I'd watch your mouth Lync.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.546
Volt's as tough as they get.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.448
Keep yapping and you'll be in tears.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.716
All of you be quiet!

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.686
Hey, I was sticking up for you...I knew you weren't a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.522
cry baby! [laughs]

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.929
What's his problem?

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.598
I don't care what it takes.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.666
I have to get Brontes back from Gus!

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.274
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Brontes' Betrayal.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:29.949
[\u266a]

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.152
[grunt]

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.354
Brawlers!

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:35.455
I need you in the transmission room!

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.623
[panting]

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.091
Someone's sending a message from Marucho's house.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.093
But there isn't anyone at my house right now.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.495
Maybe it's an intruder!

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.597
[gasp]

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.599
Marucho...I'm so sorry to barge in like this, but I

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.402
had no choice...Something horrible has happened and

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.237
I needed to warn you.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.273
Calm down Alice, tell us what happened.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.342
Just now...the Vexos attacked Hydranoid and I.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.544
What?

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.812
Why would the Vexos attack Earth?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.114
This is bad.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.483
It makes no sense...why would Zenoheld send

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.418
someone to there to Brawl when we're all here on

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:08.254
Vestal with the Attribute Energies they want?

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.389
[gasp]

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:12.025
Has anyone heard from Shun on New Vestroia, yet?

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.027
Maybe this is another trap.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.161
Another ?

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.629
First New Vestroia then Earth.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.131
Zenoheld is trying to lure us.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.999
I think you're probably right.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.102
The Vexos will be back, I just know it...Runo and

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.738
Julie could be in danger.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.106
Stinkin' Vexos!

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.341
They've got us running around like a bunch of

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.509
headless chickens.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.244
They're always one step ahead.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.912
That was so wrong to attack Alice when they

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.248
know she doesn't Brawl anymore.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.250
Those creeps need to be taught some manners.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.586
I agree with you Marucho...They are nothing

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.287
more than swine who need to be corralled back into

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.089
their pen.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.991
[sigh] We've gotta go back to Earth.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.993
Trap or no trap, we can't leave Runo and Julie

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.394
hanging like that.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.596
Yeah!

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.097
We're right behind you.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.732
Here we come, Vexos.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.670
I've just completed another series of tests

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.405
and it seems the reprogramming of Brontes'

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.907
is a total success.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.976
He is now another loyal soldier in your army.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.143
Fantastic.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.578
My plans to harness the Perfect Core Energy are

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.146
proceeding perfectly.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.082
Yes...but I should advise you...

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.817
our scanners picked up a Dimension Transporter

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.219
pathway between the Royal Palace and Earth.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.021
Zenoheld must have figured out that we blocked his

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.323
transport abilities to Vestal and now has chosen

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.158
Earth as his battlefield.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.928
If he can't travel to the Brawlers then my bet is

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.997
he'll lure them home and into his trap.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.298
What do we do now?

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.733
I'll have to pay a surprise visit to the

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.402
Brawlers and take Drago's Perfect Core Energy,

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.903
before they make the jump back to Earth.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.105
You'll have to move fast.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.273
I learned a lot about the evolved Drago's new powers

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:35.808
in our last encounter.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.810
This next Battle will have a very different outcome

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.512
for Dan Kuso.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.848
You're kidding me!

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.017
You mean there's no way we can transport ourselves

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.284
back to Earth?

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.186
Alice said Dr. Michael's laboratory was mostly

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.055
destroyed in her Battle with Shadow Prove.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.556
Oh man!

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.658
I can't believe it.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:52.692
What are we gonna do now?

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.127
Calm down, Dan.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.296
For every problem there is a solution.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.497
Drago's right.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.866
There has to be a way we can figure this out.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.505
What's this?

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.306
Why is no one eating their afternoon snack?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.308
You're going to need it for strength for all of

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.776
the Brawling ahead.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.978
Sorry Klaus, but none of us really has much of an

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.579
appetite right now.

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.381
How can you expect us to even think about food

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.417
after what Alice just told us?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.651
You worry too much, Dan.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.753
Master Klaus was concerned but he didn't want you,

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.455
his guests to be concerned.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.757
He prepared this meal for you so you could relax

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.093
while he made arrangements for your journey home.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.129
Dr. Michael isn't the only one with a Dimension

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.598
Transporter System...I've got one of my own here in

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.733
the castle.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.001
Well, why didn't you say so?

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.136
We've been sitting here freaking out this whole time!

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.638
Sorry.

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.839
I'm impressed.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.474
Even I don't' have one of those.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.914
What are you doing, Gus?

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.849
I'm sorry Spectra.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.551
When I last saw Volt, he swore he'd get Brontes

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.719
back at any cost.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:53.853
Hmmph.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.488
Sounds like he was challenging you to a brawl.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.957
Perhaps he was, but my focus is required here,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.092
helping you with -

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.159
Nonsense.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.327
I insist that you go and fight.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.762
What kind of man would you be if you didn't accept

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.430
Volt's brazen challenge?

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:07.533
Besides, perhaps Volt will want Brontes badly enough

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.436
that he'll be willing to betray the Vexos...

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.904
Yes, of course Master Spectra.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.607
Well, it's been lovely having you in my home, but

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.243
I suppose it's time for you to be on your way back now.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.544
Yup.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.612
Uh-huh.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:20.947
How 'bout you, Mira? Are you coming with us?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.548
Did you think I'd sit this one out?

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:24.083
Ace, my man?

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.586
You bet, Dan...I've got a score to settle with that

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.122
Vexos witch who jumped me outside.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.289
Thanks again Klaus.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.457
My pleasure, Ace.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.959
What about you, Baron?

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:33.960
You in?

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.562
Sorry, Master Dan...I can't come with you.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.865
I've got some things at home that I have to take care of.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.899
Catch you later.

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.701
Really? You're not coming with us?

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.703
It's not that I don't want too, but I really can't

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.605
leave without at least saying goodbye to my

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.973
brothers and sisters first.

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:49.208
You're right Baron, you can't break their hearts like that...

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.277
Do what you need to do and we'll make sure to save a

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.079
couple Vexos creeps for you.

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:54.680
Thanks, Ace.

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.282
I'm glad you understand.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.050
Baron...Don't worry, man.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.285
We won't leave until you're ready.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:00.419
Huh?

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.621
We're a team.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:02.922
That means we stick together.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.056
Mmm-hmm.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.392
Cool!

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.995
Huh? Whoa, the alarm!

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:22.975
[\u266a]

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.011
I don't know what the etiquette is here on

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.712
Vestal, but where I come from, it's rude to show up

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:27.713
unannounced.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:29.882
Don't waste my time. Where are the Brawlers?

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.317
I'm not sure who you're speaking of, but if it's

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.753
Battle you want, I'd be happy to accommodate you.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:37.690
[chuckle] Are all of you Earthlings so arrogant?

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.292
[chuckle]

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.993
I think it's you who's the arrogant one.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.695
Coming into my house uninvited and looking to

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:43.896
pick a fight.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.998
I'm losing my patience.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:49.402
Patience is a virtue...As is loyalty.

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.337
But that's something you know nothing about.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.005
Perhaps that is why you will always be at a

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.106
disadvantage.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.608
The bond the Brawlers share as group is more

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.743
powerful than anything.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.846
There is much you could learn from them.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.047
I doubt it.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.115
When you see them, tell them they can't run forever.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:10.423
Oh my goodness, that was a close one, Master Klaus.

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.992
Yes it was.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.360
Baron, you're back!

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.628
Of course I am!

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.662
I told you I would be.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.264
I missed you so much, big brother.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.999
I've been waiting all day to talk to you.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.367
[baby gurgles]

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.535
Sorry guys...Bad news.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:23.836
I have to head out with Master Dan and the others

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.937
for a while.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:26.305
Awwwww...

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.241
You just got back from your last trip.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.643
Bah-bah...stay!

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.112
Sorry guys, but a good friend is in trouble on Earth.

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.348
I have to go and help her...You understand, right?

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.515
It's important.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.451
Sorry little dudes I promise we'll have your

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.353
Big Bro back soon.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.521
He's a very important part of our team.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:43.823
Don't worry, we understand.

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.191
You're a hero, Baron.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.826
And that means sometimes you have to be away from

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.427
your family...Right?

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.263
Right!

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.299
You guys are the greatest brothers and sisters a guy

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:56.035
could ever ask for...Be good for Mom while I'm gone.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.837
Bye-bye!

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.672
Byyyyye Baron!

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:10.383
[\u266a]

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.119
Gus?

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.521
He's gone.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:22.495
[\u266a]

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.530
I don't understand why you want to fight so badly for

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.533
Brontes...especially after you threw him away.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.968
I don't expect you to understand,

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.437
traitor...Let's just say, Brontes and I have a

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.639
special bond, okay?

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.841
And nothing will stand in my way of getting him back!

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.810
[\u266a]

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.245
Forgive me, Brontes!

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:40.279
I'm coming to get you back!

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.182
[\u266a]

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.251
Don't be fooled, Brontes. You belong with me!

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.853
Thanks for letting us use your secret tunnel exit

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.055
earlier, Klaus.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.623
But of course. That's the reason I built it.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.525
If we'd run into Spectra, I might not have been able

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.026
to say bye to my family.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.728
I sense you have many battles ahead of you

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.964
Brawlers...Sirenoid and I will keep our fingers

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:01.133
crossed that you will be victorious against the Vexos.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.569
Please be careful and take care of one another.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.871
Don't worry, Sirenoid. We will.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.373
Come on, guys. Let's hit it!

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.608
Yeah!

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:11.744
Tell me what you did to Brontes, Gus!

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.479
Sorry, Volt, but your puny little brain couldn't

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.881
possibly comprehend it...Let's just say I

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.450
helped your precious Brontes, evolve into

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:18.818
something better.

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:20.286
You animal!

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:22.722
You're gonna pay for what you did!

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.857
You know he screamed for you, Volt.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.126
How do you think he felt when you didn't come save him?

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.862
You're gonna regret what you did to him, Gus.

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.063
Hmmmph.

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.632
Does he remembers your name.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.733
Hmmmph.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:34.967
Let's go!

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.837
Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.340
Gate Card, set!

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.243
Bakugan, Brawl!

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.112
Bakugan, stand!

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.080
Haos Boriates!

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.383
You're about to understand, Volt...

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.118
what it means to be betrayed!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.954
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.355
Bakugan, stand!

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.624
Haos Brontes!

00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:02.661
[\u266a]

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.665
[evil laugh]

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.733
Whah? Haos Brontes?

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.268
I hardly recognize him!

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.336
[chuckle]

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:11.704
Pay close attention, Volt!

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.739
This is what perfection looks like!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.575
You turned him into a monster!

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:20.980
Brontes was a Bakugan who had magical abilities.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:23.349
If he's evolved then that must mean that his magic

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:25.718
has grown in strength too.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.853
I don't think I've ever seen you so scared.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:30.122
What would King Zenoheld say if he could see you now.

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.058
This isn't fear...It's anger and you're about to

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:34.093
learn the difference.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.028
It's possible that I might be able to predict how

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.564
Brontes will behave in battle, but then again...

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.933
...who knows what Gus has re-wired in his brain.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:43.102
I hope I can beat them without hurting Brontes

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.136
too badly.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.371

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:48.240

[\u266a]

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:54.880
Good luck trying to activate abilities

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.283
now...What now, Gus?

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:58.384
Hmmph.

00:11:58.417 --> 00:11:59.485
If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.953
afraid to fight.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:05.758
Come Bakugan Trap, Subterra Hexados!

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:12.832
[\u266a]

[\u266a]

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.708
So much for your big, strong Odin Shield,

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.077
Volt...If you really want Brontes back, you're going

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:26.378
to have to fight him.

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:29.682
You won't be satisfied until you see me hurt him, will you?

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:31.617
If I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.720
hurting Brontes...It's time to show you the full

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:36.689
power of the evolved Haos Brontes.

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.090

Hmmmph.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.483
I don't think you've got the guts to blast your

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:05.785
dear old best friend.

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:12.224

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:31.844
Later, Hexados!

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.913
Gus Life Force, 30%.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.147
[gasp]

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.749
Why did you go and attack Hexados if Brontes was the

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:39.785
one who activated the ability?

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.221
I figured that Brontes was hiding behind Hexados

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.822
while making it look like he the one who was

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.858
activating the ability.

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:46.959
Of course.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.260
You used to battle together.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.296
I should have known you would remember that trick.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.331
Well, out with the old and in with the new!

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.033
Ability, activate!

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.834
Atmosphere!

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:57.002
Go Brontes!

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:59.705
[evil laughter]

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.574
[\u266a]

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.075
How's that for a counter attack?

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:04.143
Think you can keep up?

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.277
Huh, Volt?

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.780
[grunt]

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:10.182
[\u266a]

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.851
I think I've figured out his strategy, Brontes, but

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.320
we need to be patient.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.722
I'll take down Gus in the next round and then you'll

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.691
be mine again.

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:20.693
Attack, Boriates!

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:24.930
[\u266a]

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.632
Where'd he go?

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:27.766
[chuckle]

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.201
That's a little something I like to call, Stealth

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.304
Mode...Too bad Boriates can't keep up.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.107
The problem with you Vexos is that you've become

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.210
lazy...It's not enough to be the best, you must

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.080
always be trying to better yourself...You must learn

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:44.416
to evolve...That's what I did to Brontes.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.753
I forced him to grow and evolve and now look at him!

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.255
You're a liar Gus!

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.323
You tortured him and made him suffer only to serve

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.425
the selfish needs of Spectra!

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:56.395
Ability activate!

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.464
Tempest Arrow!

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.439
[gasp] No!

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:08.607
You're right.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.675
It's not about being the best...

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.411
it's about knowing you're the best.

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:14.680
Do you need a little break, pal?

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.682
....Maybe go and curl your hair?

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.550
Gate Card, open!

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.586
Battle Release!

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.689
The Command Card Battle Release halts all battles and

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:27.459
forces each of the Bakugan to return to their sides.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.561
Ability, activate!

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.196
Black Gates!

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.133
[evil laughter]

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:37.002
What?

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:39.705
How dare you pretend to be fighting for the life of

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:43.042
your former Bakugan...when you and the one you serve

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:44.543
have guaranteed their extinction with the

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.812
creation of the BT System?

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:47.980
[gasp]

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.548
Perhaps it's time to reconsider loyalties,

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:50.749
Volt.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.151
If you care so deeply about Brontes, you must

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:54.386
have doubts about Zenoheld's plans for the Bakugan.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.521
[gasp]

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:56.655
Join us.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.757
We could use someone with your abilities...Master

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.993
Spectra would be pleased to welcome you.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:03.962
I am a Vexos!

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:07.199
Not a filthy traitor like you and that coward Spectra!

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.300
Hmmmph.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.669
Very well, then...I will show no mercy!

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.171
Let's go, Brontes!

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:15.507
[evil laughter]

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.143
[\u266a]

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.244
This is the end!

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:21.413
Double Ability, activate!

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:25.451
Shining Nightmare plus Sprite Glow!

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:34.426
[\u266a]

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.263
[evil laughter]

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:39.365
[grunt]

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:40.833
Ability, activate!

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:43.969
Firebolt Axe!

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:46.205
[evil laughter]

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:49.675
[\u266a]

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:51.276
You think you have a chance of defeating us

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.345
with a pathetic weapon like that?

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.214
No mercy, Brontes!

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:58.083
[evil laughter]

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.886
[\u266a]

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:01.987
[grunt]

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:05.891
Face it, Volt. It's over.

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.927
There is nothing left here for you to win.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.396
You may as well give up.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.865
The Brontes you once knew is long gone.

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:18.337
Gate Card, set!

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.739
Here we go, Haos Brontes!

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:23.142
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.744
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:29.715
[evil laughter]

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:32.217
You may have changed his outer appearance...inside

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.852
he's Brontes!

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.454
Come on Boriates...

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.756
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.658
Bakugan Stand!

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:44.530
[\u266a]

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:47.032
He threw you away like garbage Brontes.

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:48.434
Let's make him pay.

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:50.335
Ability activate!

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.970
Magic Dice!

00:17:52.004 --> 00:18:00.779
[\u266a]

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:03.282
Boriates' your power level!

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.884
Ability activate!

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:12.524
Element Glow!

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:14.259
[explosion]

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.694
What happened?

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.396
Consecutive ability activation?

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.530
That's right.

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:19.565
Poor you.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.700
A consecutive death attack.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:27.439
[\u266a]

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.475
Boriates, no!

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.110
[evil laughter]

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.744
A consecutive mortal attack...

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.414
It's fatal for the Bakugan releasing it.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.515
No worries...

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:37.850
If Brontes gets weak from it, I'll just make him

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.785
evolve again.

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:42.287
Ability, activate!

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.490
Prometheus Cannon!

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:50.395
[\u266a]

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.630
[chuckle]

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:53.265
Gate Card, open!

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.068
Land Pressure!

00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:01.940
[\u266a]

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.709
Say goodbye to your Brontes.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:06.278
Ability activate!

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:08.180
Trance Rapture Illusion!

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:12.017
[scary clown laughing]

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.920
Brontes, no!

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.088
[scary clown laughter]

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.357
Brontes! Stop it! Your heart can't take it!

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.591
I'm sorry.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.661
I should have protected you....Please stop, I'm sorry!

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:23.862
Hmm...

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.097
Don't' worry about his heart.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.965
It's long gone.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.934
I've failed him...again....I'd give

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.470
anything to go back and save him that day.

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:33.972
[evil clown laughter]

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.174
Brontes!

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:38.110
[anguished scream] Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:41.914
[\u266a]

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.516
Volt Life Force...zero.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.318
[exertion]

00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:51.156
Brontes....

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:00.566
Forgive me.

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:06.805
Why would you risk your life to save a lowly Bakugan?

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:10.609
I don't understand you, Volt.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.984
Gus, you've returned.

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:21.219
Yes, Master Spectra.

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.988
What happened with Volt?

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:26.558
Sorry sir...He said that he had no desire to leave

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:29.595
the Vexos and join us, Master Spectra.

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:30.896
Oh well.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.465
At least you tried.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.280
You served your purpose but now I'm done with you.

00:20:55.988 --> 00:21:01.026
[\u266a]

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.996
Volt...save me.

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:10.369
When Dan and the others heard about the Vexos

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.970
attacking Alice, they rushed back to Earth and

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.072
we began to plan our next strategy.

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.807
But just when it got to Julie's and my turn to

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.076
speak we were very rudely interrupted...

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.945
Mylene and Lync showed up with their mechanical

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:22.814
Bakugan and things got crazy insane.

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.283
We were so mad!

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:26.918
We had to show them we weren't gonna sit back and take it.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.087
Just because we're cute doesn't mean we're not tough.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.956
Just thinking about it gets me wound up.

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.524
Tune in and check it out.

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:34.226
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.327
Come and get it!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:46.838
[\u266a]

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:56.481
[\u266a]
