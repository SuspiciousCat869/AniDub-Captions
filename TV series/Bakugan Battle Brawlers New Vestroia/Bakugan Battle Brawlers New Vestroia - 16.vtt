WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.075
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.578
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.881
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.150
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.919
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.254
Resistance!

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.923
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.394
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.995
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.497
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.035
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:45.111
[\u266a]

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:54.754
[\u266a]

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.872
Master Spectra! Wake up!

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.807
Did you know Earth has juice in boxes?

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.612
Master?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.355
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Show Me the Power!\"

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.024
Bakugaaaan!

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.994
Bakugan is lots of fun.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.763
Our Brawlin's got 'em on the run!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.332
Left, right, left, right!

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.566
Pick it up Baron!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.801
Finish line!

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.539
[panting]

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.908
You're trying to kill me.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.344
Poor Baron looks ready to... collapse.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.479
[quiet laughing]

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.481
Aaah! Hurts so good!

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.183
You're training hard, Dan.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.384
Yeah...

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.419
But when I think of Marucho and Shun battling alone

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.155
on New Vestroia, I can't just sit here and do nothing.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.257
You know?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.127
So I'm gonna train and stay in fighting shape.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.663
Say cheesy!

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.832
Runo?

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.867
Now I'll have to take another one.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.168
You totally blinked.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.203
Hey a new camera?

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.538
That's cool.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.306
I borrowed it from my Dad...

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.542
When things get tough, shots like these remind me

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:56.876
why we battle.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.044
Lemme take one!

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.480
No way! You'll break it!

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.116
You'll probably throw it like a Bakugan!

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.317
I will not! Just give it!

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.585
[amused laugh]

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.086
Hey! Hands off! Get your own camera.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.630
You might be interested to know your former Bakugan

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.266
now belong to Hydron.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.401
What do you mean?

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.704
They are now giant, bronze statues decorating his

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.905
throne room.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.107
He's quite proud of his collection.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.309
No way!

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.443
Statues?

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.478
The only way for you to save your friends is to

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.447
work with me.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.516
I'm telling you the truth!

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.750
oh...But...

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.185
Don't listen to him!

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.855
Even if what you say is true we'll never join the Vexos!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.824
You're the ones who invaded New Vestroia and

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.426
captured the Bakugan...

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.294
First you take their world, then you treat them

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.429
like animals.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.364
There's no way we'll work with you!

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.135
You spend too much time thinking of the past.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.837
What's done is done.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.473
Luckily, I can tell you what your future holds in

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.075
my crystal ball.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.577
Ooh, it's really bad!

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.679
You'll suffer a terrible fate if you stay on the

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.448
path you've chosen.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.416
[amused, closed-mouth chuckle]

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.298
Master!

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.100
I thought you ditched me!

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.168
You shouldn't go out on your own!

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:30.770
This world is so strange.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.872
I thought you got hit by a bus or something!

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.008
You should have called me...

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.343
or left a note, master!

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.380
Since when are you my mother, Gus?

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.615
Since... never?

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:43.616
But...

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.818
you keep me completely in the dark.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.788
You treat those Battle Brawlers with more respect...

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.190
I don't get why we need to have them on our side...

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.992
I'm as good a Brawler as any of them.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.594
Except Dan Kuso.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.730
You don't get it, Gus.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:00.933
It's not the Battle Brawlers that we need...

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.569
...It's the power of their Bakugan.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.575
I'm tired of waiting.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:13.780
Make contact with Dan Kuso.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.982
I tried to make him see reason...

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.886
Now I will have to take his Pyrus Dragonoid by force.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.325
Man, we are totally soaked!

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.961
You kids are flooding the hallway.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.897
I'll mop it up right away, Master Dan's mom...

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.998
Beats more running.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.966
I thought he liked running.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.568
Oh he does...

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.538
Just not a ten mile run in the rain.

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.806
Too much, huh?

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.908
A little hot chocolate will cheer you both up.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.645
Ooh yeah! With marshmallows!

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:46.879
[tired sigh]

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.284
I know you!

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.286
Dan Kuso...

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.721
Spectra!

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:59.525
I challenge you to another Bakugan battle, if you dare...

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.061
Let's settle our differences once and for all.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.329
Alone...

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:05.398
After all, it won't be any fun if the others

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:08.201
interfere like last time, will it?

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.369
You want a one on one battle, huh?

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.105
That sounds good to me.

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.307
And I know the perfect place for it too.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.675
It's your territory...

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.777
You can pick the spot.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.313
[cocky chuckle]

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.483
Be careful...

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.185
Dan! You coming?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.054
Dan? No way.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:30.323
He's gone on another run?

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:33.960
Why can't I go with you?

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:37.797
If something goes wrong you might need me and Vulcan!

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.603
Do you truly believe I can't defeat one foolish Earthling?

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.738
No-- No way!

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.541
Dan Kuso is no match for your devastating power,

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.076
Master Spectra...

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:51.210
Forgive me.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.545
I was just kidding.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.113
Glad to hear it...

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.348
Gus.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.219
It's bad weather...

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.288
for a Pyrus battle.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.157
We're not afraid of a little rain.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.892
Right, Helios?

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.427
[dismissive grunt] No rain could douse the flames

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.596
that burn within me.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.266
You are eager for a rematch.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.268
Yes...

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.905
The dragonoid would never have defeated me without

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.441
the power of the perfect core.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.042
I must have revenge!

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:26.612
Hi guys...

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.014
Master Runo!

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.382
Hey, where's Dan?

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.450
Isn't... he with you?

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.585
He's gone...

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.421
He just took off somewhere in the rain...

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:38.624
Maybe I should have tried to follow him or something.

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:39.792
He took off?

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.561
Oh man, that's never a good sign...

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.496
Dan doesn't look for trou- -ble.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:44.964
Trouble sure looks for him.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:02.348
Right here I've got home field advantage...

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.017
This is where I finally took down Masquerade.

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.819
Gauntlet Activated.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.421
[cocky laugh]...

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.189
It won't help you.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.824
Gauntlet Activated.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:14.093
Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.533
Careful Dan.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.903
Spectra's Bakugan was strong enough to overwhelm Tigrerra!

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.805
Chill out, Drago...

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.506
We both know the score...

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.476
It's time to put Spectra on ice... for good.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.345
Then what are we waiting for?

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.113
Gate Card Open!

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:42.622
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.323
Flame on, Drago!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.925
Let's show 'em how it's done!

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.593
[powerful battle roar]

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:51.264
You're no match... for my all-powerful, Pyrus Helios!

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.299
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.167
Helios Stand!

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.504
[powerful battle roar]

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.645
We meet again, Helios.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.280
Hmmmph...

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.449
I've been waiting for a rematch, dragonoid!

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:12.351
Today I will show you...

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.021
what true power is!

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.223
Bring it on!

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:21.093
In the name of my friends and New Vestroia, let's brawl!

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.697
I'm gonna tear Drago apart!

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.565
[battle roar]

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.635
You don't look so tough, dragonoid.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:30.937
Oh yeah?

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.271
Ability Card, Set!

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.574
Let's show 'em Drago.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:36.242
Ability Activate.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.610
Burning Dragon!

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:40.813
[battle attack roar]

I quite agree.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.402
This would all be over but you're afraid to show me

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:25.404

Pathetic...

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.141
No, it's beautiful.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:18.677
[mighty roar]

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:26.785
All that power concentrated in one human's Bakugan.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.355
What a waste.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:33.726
But it won't be, once I've got my hands on it.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.028

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.026
Your Triple Ability means nothing...

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.428

[evil snicker]

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:45.491

Spectra, no!

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.974
How can you do this to your partner?

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:05.377
By using Chaos Ability X, I can give him power

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.946
beyond his limit!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.081
Admit it...

00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.203
Drago!

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.273
I'm sorry, Dan.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.381
Life gauge zero.

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:50.289
No! It can't be!

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.826
Thanks for the Pyrus Dragonoid, Dan Kuso.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.497
Wait a minute. You can't do this!

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.532
You want me to just give back Drago?

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:04.536
You're a brawler, like me...

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.073
So you know that you have to win him back in battle...

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.842
[dismissive chuckle]

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.411
[conflicted breathing]...

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.812
But...

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.715
[despairing breathing]

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.887
Drago!

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:28.594
[frightened gasp]

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:29.828
Oh dear!

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:32.030
Your future is even darker than before!

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.633
You must have done something pretty terrible

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:37.235
since the last time I saw you here.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.238
I've heard enough, you foolish old woman.

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.343
[frightened squeal]

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:55.187
Why should I care what a fortune teller thinks?

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.923
All that matters is reaching my ultimate goal.

00:20:57.956 --> 00:21:00.759
All that matters is the final victory!

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:03.262
[frustration grunt] [frustrated breathing]

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:07.099
No... Noooooooo!

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.669
Spectra may have taken Drago away but I'm not

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:12.371
gonna waste time sulking.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:15.207
I'm in for some heavy duty training!

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.275
Aw, who am I kidding?

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.946
How can I free the Bakugan without Drago?

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:25.017
I'm gonna need some serious back-up.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:29.354
Like, ancient, mystic warrior serious!

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.457
The action's heating up!

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.059
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:36.662
It's gonna be the biggest brawl yet!

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:46.738

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:56.381
