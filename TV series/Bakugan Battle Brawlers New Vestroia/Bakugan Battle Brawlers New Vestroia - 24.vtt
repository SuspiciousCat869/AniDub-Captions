00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.842
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.644
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.714
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.350
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.321
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.857
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.794
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.062
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.397
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.799
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:45.245
[\u266a]

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:54.888
[\u266a]

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.170
Prince Hydron thinks he's safe...

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.405
in his sky palace.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.675
But he's not as long as Tigrerra and the others

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.477
are his prisoners.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.578
I've seen them.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.979
They've been turned into bronze statues in his

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.282
throne room.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.385
That's horrible...

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.520
We've got to free them.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.155
We will, Marucho.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.658
We'll free them all.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.092
Hang on, guys...

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.761
We're coming.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.697
And this time nothing's gonna stop us!

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.506
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Ultimate Bakugan\".

[closed-mouth dismissive hmmph]

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:55.582
Don't celebrate your victory yet...

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.518
I won't give my collection to anybody.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.155
Final Controller... on.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:28.114
[\u266a]

[\u266a]

What the?

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.158
Oh no!

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.659
Watch out!

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.895
What's going on?

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.030
We're reverting again!

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.198
Elfin!

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.601
It's a long way down without you!

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.702
[surprised cry]

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.803
Shun!

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.682
Whoooooaaa!

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.252
You got us but who's got them?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.320
[falling cry]

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.755
Stay calm, Baron!

[falling cry]

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:10.924
Ace!

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.058
[falling cry]

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.226
Going downnnnn!

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.294
Dan!

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.628
[falling cry]

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.070
[extreme effort]

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.371
Whoa!

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:29.842
[extreme effort]

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.912
W-wow...

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.747
[extreme effort]

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.749
[hitting ground]

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.953
[relieved sigh]

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.222
Thank you, Drago.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.191
That was above and beyond.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.292
[exhausted panting]

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.427
You're heavier than I remember.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.561
[exhausted panting]

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.063
He means, \"you're welcome\".

[exhausted sigh]

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.700
[relieved laugh]

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:56.603
Where are Shun and the others?

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.705
I'm sure they're all right.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:03.610
[\u266a]

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:05.445
Shun, Mira and Marucho should be halfway to

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.580
Vespalace by now.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.549
That was totally weird...

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.784
Why did you guys turn back into balls?

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.722
Yeah, didn't we destroy all the Dimension Controllers?

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.557
Well, it looks like...

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.126
the prince kept one in reserve.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.696
It seems the young prince is trickier than we thought.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.567
I just hope... the others are okay.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.635
They're okay.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.637
Drago won't let them down.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.472
I guess so...

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.240
Wilda's right.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.375
You think?

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.810
Dan's been in worse spots than this...

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.579
We need to go on with the mission.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.314
Guess we're taking the stairs.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.816
Yeah! Master Dan!

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.885
Did you say, take the stairs?

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.054
That'll take forever.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.057
And then we'll be all sweaty and tired.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.693
If we've returned to ball form then there's another

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.095
Dimension Controller up there.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.699
We can't fly you all up to the palace like this.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.134
I agree.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.935
We'll have to find another way.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.337
What's the point?

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.973
Your true battle is right here.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:13.880
We have a score to settle, dragonoid.

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.448
Helios!

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.849
The same goes for us...

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:18.318
Dan Kuso.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.952
You got that right.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.022
There can't be two ultimate Bakugan.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.591
Drago?

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.494
I'm ready.

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.029
Sorry, Ace, Baron...

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.565
Before we can head up to Vespalace I'm going to

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.767
finish off Spectra in a battle.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.202
[closed-mouth agreement]

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.271

You've never seen anything like Cyborg Helios!

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:18.077
Something's not right.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.283
[powerful, ready for battle roar]

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.185
What have they done to him?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.453
Helios!

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.522
You've turned your body into a machine?

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.224
How could you sink so low?

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.458
So low?

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.893
You're wrong.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.796

There's no damage at all?

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.449
Hah!

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:33.619
We're just getting started.

might and Vestal technology.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:03.149

What do you think now, dragonoid?

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.222
You can't hurt me.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.859
I am more powerful than you are.... More powerful

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.395
than the Perfect Core itself!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.532
More powerful than the Perfect Core?

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.434
We shall see!

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:07.173
Got it Drago!

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:09.175
Strike the final blow, Helios!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.177

Drago!

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.627
Stay tuned.

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.162
This could be our last brawl.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.397
Go Drago!

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:34.967
Nothing will stand in my way!

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.617
Pathetic.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.152
You don't stand a chance.

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:56.188

[low menacing growl]

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.465
So you think you're more powerful than the perfect core?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.300
Think again!

[punching effort]

Yes! TKO!

Way to go!

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.285
Master Dan blew him out of the water.

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:28.888
Yeah but... Next one decides it.

[building power roar]

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:48.140
Looks like Spectra is having some trouble.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:51.077
I'll have to show him how it's done.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.981
Lync, is the Alternate Mechanical Bakugan battle ready?

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:57.183
Yes.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.250
Good...

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:00.352
Then deliver it to me immediately...

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.856
Yeah, well... about that...

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.392
Spectra took off with both units...

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.360
I'm sorry, Prince.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.528
Outrageous!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.430
How dare he defy me!

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.432
Please forgive me, sire...

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:16.535
It's all my fault.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.671
Get out of my sight, Lync...

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:21.273
I'll figure out how to punish you later.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:23.242
Very well, my prince.

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:24.810
Well, Spectra...

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:28.881
you are playing a very dangerous little game.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.783
Oooh, I'm so scared...

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.184
He's gonna punish me?

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:35.421
That Hydron's gonna be looking for a new job soon...

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:38.557
Well, if it isn't my favourite nightmare.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.493
The prince might be washed up...

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.862
but Spectra's become so obsessed with power, his

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:45.231
days are numbered too.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.766
You should think carefully about whose side you want

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.402
to be on when the smoke clears.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.004
Whaddya say, traitor?

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.439
Gonna change sides?

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:56.675
Shaaaaa!

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.477
Seems I've underestimated...

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.147
the power of the Perfect Core.

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.819
Not for long.

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.688
Deactivate lock.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.733
How many of those things have you got?

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:23.135
Mira and Gus tested them out for me...

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.436
Now watch!

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.604

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.006

He's combined them all...

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.999
And their power level is off the chain...

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.034
[gasp]

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:57.169
It's worse than I thought!

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.872
Meet Maxus Helios.

He's a monster.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.754
Not true...

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.624
Helios is the ultimate brawling machine.

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.192

Nothing?

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.827
And we're hitting him with everything we've got.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.228
What now?

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.365
[evil laugh]

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:10.736
Is that the best that the Perfect Core can do?

We're clearing out of here...

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:26.618
And you'll be coming with us whether you like it or not.

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:30.689
What Volt means to say is; we'd like you to come with us.

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:33.859
Is that what Prince Hydron wishes me to do?

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.928
Or are you planning to abandon him as New

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.030
Vestroia breaks apart?

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:41.467
If that's what you want, I'm not prepared to do it.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.002
You're making a mistake, Professor.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.271
As the head of this research facility I know

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.107
where my duty lies...

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.809
What you're suggesting, my friend, is treason.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.379
Ah drop the mumbo jumbo, will ya?

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.913
You're working for us from now on.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.048
Got it?

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:58.350
You have a way with words, don't you Shadow?

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:02.287
If you're worried about the Prince, don't be.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:03.822
Spectra will take the fall.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:04.990
Spectra?

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:06.992
He's the reason the Dimension Controllers have

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:09.294
been destroyed.

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:13.699
It figures Mylene would try to pin this all on Spectra.

Sneaking around like usual, Gus?

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.602
Shhh!

Listen Lync...

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.239
Tell Spectra Mylene's up to something.

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.540
Like what?

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:24.042
Not only are those snakes are planning to leave,

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.378
they want to take Professor Clay with them.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.713

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:49.001
So this is Prince Hydron's throne room?

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.302
We'll have to be careful.

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.337
He could show up any moment.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:56.909

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:45.891
[\u266a]

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:48.060
Ultimate Formation.

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:49.428
[fiendish battle roar]

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.929
Ultimate Helios Stand!

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.431
[evil battle roar]

00:18:52.464 --> 00:19:03.075
[\u266a]

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:06.011
It's the beginning of the end, Dan Kuso.

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:08.113
Whoa! He brought it out again.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.616
Master Dan is the best but there's no way he can beat

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.618
that power level, is there?

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:15.320
He'll figure it out.

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:16.922
Looks like...

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.925
We have no choice.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:24.329
Drago, we gotta bring out these bad boys.

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.898
The ones I won off Mira.

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.733
Dan! What are you?

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:28.934
Look...

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.003
Helios is doing it so you should too.

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:32.538
Otherwise we're toast.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.907
It's wrong.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.208
I know it's hard...

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:39.044
I get that you don't like Mechanical Bakugan.

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:42.014
But this is the only way to free New Vestroia.

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.282
You're right, Dan.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.816
We have to do it!

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.386
That's the spirit.

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:50.122
Deactivate lock!

00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:53.825
[\u266a]

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.028
Let's throw down!

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.530
Ultimate formation!

00:19:58.564 --> 00:19:59.831
[battle roar]

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.433
Ultimate Drago Stand!

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:04.436
[triumphant battle roar]

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:14.513
[\u266a]

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:24.156
[\u266a]

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:29.494
Lookin' good!

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.929
It suits him.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.931
Let's see what he does with it.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.133
[delighted laugh]

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:37.903
When Dan does something, he does it big.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.574
How's it feel, man?

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:43.642
[approving grunt]

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:44.910
Not bad.

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:46.845
[closed mouth evil snicker]

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.680
At first you were condemning me Dan...

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:52.084
for using Mechanical Bakugan...

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:55.287
But now I see you have joined the brawl.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.924
Finally, a worthy opponent...

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:00.225
Drago!

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:01.493
Worthier than you...

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.462
Helios!

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:08.634
Mylene here.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:11.136
Since power crazy Spectra is busy with brawling Dan

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:15.607
Kuso, it's the perfect time to make my move.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.342
After all, what's the point of battling if

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.878
there's nothing left to win?

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:21.647
So I'm going to let Spectra and his Ultimate

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.449
Bakugan keep Dan Kuso busy till they bring New

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:27.352
Vestroia down around them.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.987
Don't miss next week.

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.490
Things are really taking off!

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:33.825
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.494
See you then Battle Brawlers!

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:36.828
[evil chuckle]

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:46.905
[\u266a]

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:56.548
