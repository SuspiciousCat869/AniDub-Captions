00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.442
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia, King

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.611
Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.280
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.217
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.419
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.755
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.056
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.126
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.495
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.463
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.432
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.800
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.335
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:45.412
[\u266a]

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:55.054
[\u266a]

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.902
ZENOHELD: Of the Six Attribute Energies we have

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.605
successfully obtained two: Haos and Subterra.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.141
ZENOHELD: Unfortunately, Pyrus, Darkus, Aquos and

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.143
Ventus still elude us.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.747
ZENOHELD: So then, which of you plans to fix this situation?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.981
SHADOW PROVE: Isn't it obvious, sir?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.983
I smacked down two Brawlers by myself with no

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.820
problem, so it should be...me!

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:29.155
PRINCE HYDRON: Please. You hardly made it back.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.924
PRINCE HYDRON: If you're anxious to battle again,

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.692
you should take some back up with you.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.860
SHADOW PROVE: Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh!

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:46.539
[\u266a]

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:49.542

[\u266a]

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.648
[explosion]

[\u266a]

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.385
DAN: Dino-KO!

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.722
DAN: Yeeeeeaaaaahhhh!

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.525
Dude, this movie's awesome on the big screen.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.094
Hey Drago... How 'bout those monster moves?

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.563
DRAGO: Hmmmmphh. Movies always exaggerate.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.232
I could do better.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.399
MARUCHO: I dunno, Drago.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.968
That monster's pretty tough.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.504
ACE: Whatever...It's just a stupid movie but if he

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.439
were real, Percival could take him.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.908
BARON: Yeah, and Nemus would take him too!

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.344
SHUN: But not as fast as Ingram could.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.346
DAN/BARON/ACE: [inaudible arguing in background]

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.580
RUNO: This is why I hate watching monster movies

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.383
with these guys...it always ends in an argument.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.652
JULIE: Unhhh, plus it leaves me with a headache.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.654
MIRA: It's really not their fault....They're

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.989
just extra wound up because they're stuck in

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.125
here...Boys get frustrated when they can't battle.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.694
DAN: Man, after seeing that I'm just itching to brawl with

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.429
those Vexos goons.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.232
ELFIN: Me too! This hiding out stuff is for suckers.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.468
I say we go look for some Vexos to throw down.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.602
DAN: Huh?

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.471
ELFIN: Sorry, I know it's not ladylike to say so,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.008
but I'm just so frustrated by all this sitting around.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.378
I'm no scaredy cat! I'm fierce like a tiger.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.080
Let's just see one of those Vexos try to take me down.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.582
ELFIN: I don't care who it is.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.018
Prince Hydron, Mylene, Shadow Prove, Lync...it

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.119
doesn't matter.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.188
I'll knock 'em down like a bunch of bowling pins.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.189
PREYAS: Stop it!

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.291
MARUCHO: What's wrong, Preyas?

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.458
PREYAS: She's talking craziness, that's what.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.427
None of us are afraid of the Vexos, but that

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.462
doesn't mean we can be irresponsible and go

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.964
around picking fights.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.465
PREYAS: As the keeper of the Aquos Attribute

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.602
Energy, Elfin needs to be more responsible.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.004
ELFIN: Are you calling me irresponsible?

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.339
PREYAS: \"Hot headed\" is more like it.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.740
Who do you think you are, Elfin?

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.542
Just because you've evolved doesn't mean

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.810
you're indestructible.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.011
You young ones are so cocky.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.880
ELFIN: Cocky? Just because we're not afraid to fight

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.315
like you old folks?

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.283
You've got some nerve, Preyas.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.585
PREYAS: I might be older than you, but that doesn't

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.453
mean I can't still Brawl circles around you...

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.657
[\u266a]

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.493
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Elfin on the Run.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.097
ELFIN: Ooooooh, that know-it-all Preyas really

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.600
gets my pigtails in a twist.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.269
ELFIN: I was just trying to boost team morale.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.470
ELFIN: Hot headed?

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.173
I'm not hot headed! I'm totally calm!

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.374
PREYAS: It makes no sense!

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.176
ELFIN: Preyas? Where's he saying now?

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.644
PREYAS: The Six Ancient Warriors must have been

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.045
out of their minds when they made that decision.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.180
ELFIN: Huh?

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.815
MARUCHO: I understand your frustration, Preyas, I

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:12.285
really do...but they obviously had their reasons.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.920
PREYAS: But what could they possibly be?

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.922
PREYAS: I'm the older and more experienced one.

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:18.625
I should have been the one they chose to bestow the Aquos energy

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.461
to, not that bubble-headed, pig-tailed nit wit.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.296
MARUCHO: Oh, you don't mean that.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.565
ELFIN: Soooooo. That's what this is really about.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.699
PREYAS: Whah?

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.067
ELFIN: You're jealous, that the Six Ancient

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.236
Warriors decided I was better than you.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.406
They were right! And the fact that they chose me proves it!

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.641
PREYAS: What did you just say?

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.109
MARUCHO: Enough Elfin!

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.378
That's no way to talk to Preyas...I want you to

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.846
apologize right now!

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.280
ELFIN: You're on his side too?

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.249
Thanks a lot, Marucho!

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.318
MARUCHO: Huh? No, I'm not saying...

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.787
ELFIN: Well it sure sounds like it. Don't worry...

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.489
I know when I'm not wanted.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:53.059
Maybe it's time for me head back home...where I belong!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.466
MARUCHO: [sigh] Come back, Elfin.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.570
PREYAS: Was it something I said?

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.673
ELFIN: I'm sick of hiding, sick of being treated like

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.575
a child, sick of being told what to do....

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:12.512

Why do people keep asking me for directions?

Must be this disguise.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.671
ELFIN: I've been cooped up so long.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.139
This is such a treat.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.875
Hope you're enjoying being packed in like sardines guys!

Huh?

ELFIN: Oh, no, no, no. Stop it. Stop it.

I'm gonna throw up.

along with us for back up.

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:19.612
Especially after we lectured Elfin.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.014
PREYAS: Relax. She can't have gotten far.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.383
We'll apologize and we'll all be home safe and sound

MARUCHO: I dunno.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.790
spoiled stunt for attention.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.091
MARUCHO: [panting]

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.128
You know, Preyas...you were a little hard on her, earlier.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.395
You know that?

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.364
PREYAS: She was just as hard on me.

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:40.400
This younger generation just can't take criticism.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.537
ELFIN: What am I doing here...

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.205
ELFIN: It's all Preyas' fault.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.775
If only he hadn't opened his big, fat mouth...

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.344
I wouldn't be out here all alone.

ELFIN: I'm not lost.

Can't a girl enjoy a quiet afternoon in the park...

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.635
Like candy from a baby, my man.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:18.704
ELFIN: What kind of a creep hits a girl from behind?

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.406
SHADOW PROVE: [laughter]

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.475

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:23.476
SHADOW PROVE: Hang on, Elfin!

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.477

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.645
SHADOW PROVE: Hey!

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:26.913
ELFIN: Oh!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.648
ELFIN: Whoa! [grunt]

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.216
PREYAS: Can't leave you alone for a second, can I?

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.417
ELFIN: How did you find me?

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.019
MARUCHO: Elfin! Are you okay?

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:36.389
ELFIN: Marucho, you came too?

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:39.125
PREYAS: You may not know this, but I'm a cat whisperer.

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.060
Your friend there told us where you were.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.295
MARUCHO: Thank goodness you're okay.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.130
We were so worried.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:45.531
ELFIN: Well, that's very nice and all, but I'm

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.134
sorry to tell you I won't be going back with you.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.202
PREYAS: Are you kidding me?

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.003
After we just saved your bacon?

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:52.138
MARUCHO: He didn't mean it.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:54.073
What he meant to say was that...

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.209
ELFIN: -I know what he meant. And I don't care.

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.311
My mind is made up. I'm going home!

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.546
SHADOW PROVE: Hey kiddies. Why so angry?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.815
SHADOW PROVE: I don't know what you're fighting about.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.517
But it's bumming me out.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.185
Hand over the Aquos energy!

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.992
Shadow Prove...Looks like we're gonna have to fight for it.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.596
PRINCE HYDRON: I guess it's a good thing I'm in

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.699
the mood to brawl.

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:23.569

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:21.193
I bring sweetness and light to your inevitable defeat.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.530

SHADOW PROVE: Did I say \"have\" for dinner?

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:55.661
I meant \"eat\" you for dinner.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:56.829

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.941

PRINCE HYDRON: Nice shot.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.622
ELFIN: You know, I didn't ask for your help, Preyas.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.790
PREYAS: Huh?

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.325
ELFIN: It was a trick...I wanted them to think I was

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:01.494
helpless and then turn the tables with a surprise

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.795
reverse attack.

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.398

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.137
want...I don't need a pat on the back for saving you, okay.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.473
What's most important is...is that we protect

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.042
the Aquos Energy.

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.309
MARUCHO: You only heard part of our conversation

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.611
earlier, Elfin.

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:19.712
ELFIN: Huh?

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.280
MARUCHO: Preyas said a lot more you didn't hear.

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:22.948
PREYAS: The ones who have been given the six

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.184
attribute energies have targets on their backs.

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.653
They'll be hunted by Zenoheld and the Vexos.

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.622
It's not fair that Elfin be put through that...

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.324
MARUCHO: You see, Preyas wasn't speaking out of

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.459
jealousy.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:36.095
Rather he was concerned for you and your safety.

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.496

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.198

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:05.511
And boy are you guys gonna be sorry. I promise.

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:06.845
ELFIN: Hmmmph.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:09.148
PREYAS: Hmmmph.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.282
ELFIN: Why should you have all the attribute change

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.350
fun, Preyas?

00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:12.551
I'll just step through this circle of light

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:17.156
and....slip into something a little more....Darkus!

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.657
[\u266a]

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:21.961
ELFIN: I make black and blue look soooo good?

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:26.599
PREYAS: What a great idea. Attribute Change! Darkus!

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:29.902
PREYAS: Ding dong! Darkus Preyas is here!

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:34.373
SHADOW PROVE: Finally!

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:35.808
Now you're gonna get it Brawler!

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.577
MARUCHO: Gate Card, open!

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.845
MARUCHO: Forcement Wind!

[\u266a]

SHADOW PROVE: Huh?

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.686
Why are those guys glowing and gaining power?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.788
MARUCHO: Forcement Wind is a gate card where the

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.224
power levels go up by the number of Bakugan with the

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.526
same attribute times 100!

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.761
SHADOW PROVE: That's way too much math for me.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.630
Explain please.

00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.064
PRINCE HYDRON: Basically, they just gained a bunch

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.200
of points over you.

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.868

MARUCHO: Glow Snail...

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.053
MARUCHO: ... is a combination attack with

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:24.256
Theta that increases the ability effect!

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.391
ELFIN: Oh yeaaaah!

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.159
Time for the Darkus sequel.

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:30.562
I'm gonna double my pleasure by doubling your pain.

PRINCE HYDRON: I like you, Preyas....But not enough.

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.757
Gate Card set!

ALL: Bakugan Stand!

ELFIN: Like I said, great things come in twos.

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.967
PREYAS: Which is why we're an unbeatable duo.

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:12.905

ELFIN: Oh no! Preyas!

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.166
PRINCE HYDRON: That's the thing about

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.735
invisibility...but it doesn't protect you

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:44.837
against a blow from a Trance Sword.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.238

[laughter]

PRINCE HYDRON: Sacrificing yourself like that may

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.493
have been noble...but it was also very foolish of

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:16.161
you Elfin.

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:17.329

PRINCE HYDRON: Land Pressure is a gate card

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:49.728
that manipulates gravity and renders one's opponent immobile.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:51.997
It's a slow and painful way to -

To be the one who can't move?

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.501
no energy left took us both down. It's crazy.

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.803
PRINCE HYDRON: Relax. At least we got the Aquos Energy.

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.005
That's what's most important here.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.907
I can't wait to get back to the palace and rub it

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.777
in Mylene's face.

no matter what, got it?

We're just lucky you weren't hurt any worse.

ELFIN: After I said so many mean things to you,

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:44.743
you still called me your precious little Elfin.

That blast must've rattled your brain.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.104
was to hide out and lay low.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:13.972
But that was easier said than done.

second I saw the strange Samurai in my midst.

As soon as I realized it was Volt I knew I was in
