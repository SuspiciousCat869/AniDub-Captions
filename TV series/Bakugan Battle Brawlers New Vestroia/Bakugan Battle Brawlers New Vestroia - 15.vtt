I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.250
Time to get...serious!

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.252
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

Careful.

This smells like a trap!

Of course it's a trap.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.886
And Ace and Marucho walked right into it.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:37.123
Seriously, doesn't anyone think in this Resistance?

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:42.195
We're too exposed out here...We'd better get moving.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.430
And since I have no idea how to drive Mira and

You're wrong about one thing, Shun.

What's that?

You won't be alone on this mission.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.183
No matter where you go, I'll always be by your

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.019
side, as close as your shadow.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.021
We're partners to the end.

Now we wait for Shadow Prove.

Ability Activate...Death Trident!

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.756
This'll cut you down to size.

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:28.761
[\u266a]

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.430
Ingram! Watch out!

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.870
Oh no!

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:44.777
[\u266a]

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.413
Ingram...

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.018
I'm sorry, Shun...But that's not...

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.285
I know...

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.353
[maniacal laugh]

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.856
That's not Hydranoid.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.691
Stay strong, Ingram.

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:00.993
We'll need it...for the next round.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.831
Nothing's gonna stop us this time!

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.468
Once I get rid of the Battle Brawlers this'll

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.736
my show! Haaaaa!

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.773
Gate Card...!

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.775
[\u266a]

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:18.277
Bakugan...Brawl!

Ventus Ingram Stand!

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:26.152
Let's take control of this battle!

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.054
[crazy cackle]

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.622
We'll see!

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.924
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:33.325
Bakugan Stand...

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.961
Mechanical Hydranoid, yeah!

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.998
[defiant roar]

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.333
Come, Bakugan Trap Hylash!

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:49.341
[\u266a]

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.911
[ready for battle roar]

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:55.948
You may look like Hydranoid...

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.017
...But we know you're not!

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.385
Let's prove it!

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:02.488

Sweet!

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.302
Now we'll get to see what you're really made of!

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:22.007
[gathering power roar]

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.381
Hydranoid!

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:33.819
[surprised, angry roar]

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:37.056
Wh-what...kind of creature is that?

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.824
[goofy, amused laugh]

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:41.660
You should see the look on your faces.

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:47.032
It can't be...

00:12:47.066 --> 00:13:00.379
[\u266a]

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:01.947
A mechanical Bakugan...

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.182
Of course.

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.416
It's an abomination.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.885
Impersonating Hydranoid!

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.953
[mechanical squeal/roar]

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.989
Darkus Hades is more than that.

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:13.425
He's the biggest, baddest cyber Bakugan there is!

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.461
[cocky laugh]

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:17.530
Damage to body minimal.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.797
Less than one percent.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:20.466
Defensive systems normal.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:22.201
Weapons at full power.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.970
Motor controls are go.

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:29.008
My second creation... Darkus Hades...

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.278
It has none of the weaknesses of Altair.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.612
[painful, defiant roaring]

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.047
Altair was just my first attempt at a mechanical

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.382
Bakugan.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:39.285
But then I found a way to splice Hydranoid's Bakugan

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:44.523
DNA into Vestal circuitry.

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:47.159
And now...Darkus Hades is a perfect blend of

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.829
Bakugan... and machine.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:52.998
This piece of cyber junk is a joke.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.967
It can't beat the real thing!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.902
I'm going to take your Mechanical Hades apart...

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.305
piece by piece.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.307
That's it, Ninja boy. Get mad!

Plus Phaser Trident!

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.889
Ingram, Hylash, minus 600.

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.126
Ingram! Hylash!

[\u266a]

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:32.905
I got to do something!

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.174
Professor. Fortress is finally on-line.

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.275
Yes!

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.810
Go Shadow Prove!

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:41.213
It's time to test Cyber Bakugan Trap, Fortress!

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.748
You talk too much, Prof!

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.216
Nobody tells me how to Brawl!

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.384
Bah!

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:46.885
Humph...butinski.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.287
Besides...

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.256
...I was just about to do that!

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:53.926
...Take this...Cyber...Bakugan

Trap Fortress!

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.735
This baby is fully loaded!

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:07.273
Man! Together they're almost twice as powerful!

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.841
Ingram! Hylash!

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:11.377
You gotta pull it together!

It's no good.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.793
The Power Level's too low.

[goofy, mocking laugh]

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:45.771
I'm down to my last Ability Card.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:48.173
If Shadow Prove's cards are stronger we're gonna

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.843
get hammered and that's it for the Bakugan Brawlers

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.578
Resistance.

00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:54.980
Shun, what's going on?

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:56.148
Too slow!

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.684
If you're not gonna take your turn then I'll go again!

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:01.854
Bakugan...Trap Fortress!

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:03.655
Haaaahhh!

You're afraid!

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:10.763
I can smell fear a mile away.

It's now or never, Ingram.

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:16.869
Don't be such a downer!

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.604
Just brawl already!

What?

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:30.049
I lost Skyress in a brawl like this...It happened

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:35.354
before...I can't stand to lose another partner.

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.055
Don't worry...

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.060
Think of me as your shadow, my young friend.

You don't understand.

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:44.963
I do.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.399
But like a shadow I am always with you.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:50.736
Always at your side no matter what.

We're a team. Win or lose!

00:20:43.508 --> 00:20:45.477
Sympathy's for the weak.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.412
They don't look so tough now...pickled!

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.880
[laughing]

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.984
Now all we have to do is make sure those other

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:55.020
losers stay trapped on Earth forever!

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:58.090
[laughing]

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:01.627
Then no one will ever stand in our way again.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.130
[goofy, triumphant laughter]

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.801
My name is Spectra.

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:13.438
And Dan Kuso has denied me for the last time.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:16.541
If he will not join me against Prince Hydron then

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:19.911
I will take Drago from him by force.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.814
Even if I have to unleash the dark, deadly power of

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:25.450
a forbidden card to do it.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:28.553
I'll sacrifice anything for ultimate victory and

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:31.089
Dan Kuso's defeat.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.591
Don't miss our next battle!

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.259
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:46.438
[\u266a]

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:56.081
