WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.109
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.778
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.914
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.217
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.121
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.023
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:28.028
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.229
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.563
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:35.101
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:45.178
[\u266a]

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:54.821
[\u266a]

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.567
My Prince.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.735
I have recruited

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.838
a former Battle Brawler to our side.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.040
It's Mira Fermin...

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.044
She's Professor Clay's daughter.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.212
Aaah...

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.581
You are always full of surprises, loyal Spectra,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.849
but this...

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.785
And I thought the Professor only had a son.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.253
What...

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:30.023
I'm surprised my prince knows about Clay's son.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.091
Your prince...

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.128
knows many things.... You might be surprised.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.463
So you're Mira...

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.665
I have high hopes for you my friend...

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:42.936
I am counting on you to help me complete my... collection.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.037
Collection?

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.872
[chuckling]

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.874
Would you like to see it?

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.577
[\u266a]

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.112
Gasp! Those are...

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.984
Of course you know of the six ancient, warrior

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.753
Bakugan who saved New Vestroia.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:04.157
I have collected five so far.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.327
But one of them still eludes me...Perhaps you'll

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.363
get it for me, Mira Fermin.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.465
The ultimate Bakugan....

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.634
...Pyrus dragonoid Drago.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.004
Prince Hydron.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.707
We're receiving a transmission from Vestal.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.643
Vestal? [sigh] Very well.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.545
Please put it through here...

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.846
That is all.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.515
You are both dismissed.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.588
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.056
\"Underground Takedown\".

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.528
Prince Hydron...

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.132
It amazes me how you can always find new ways to fail me.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.867
My dear father...

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.069
How nice of you to call to lend your son such

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.338
unwavering support.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.307
Don't talk back...

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.777
Remember which one of us is King.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.445
How could I forget?

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.747
And what is the King so upset

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.015
about this time?

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.349
Can't you guess?

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.450
Oh...

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.718
I suppose that...

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.654
you must be worried and concerned about the

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.989
destruction of Dimension Controllers Alpha and

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.224
Beta...

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.059
But you have nothing to fear father.

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:15.828
As long as the Controller here in Gamma City is

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.765
operational, we have complete control over the Bakugan.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.335
I would never let you down, my King.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.736
For your sake...

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.939
I hope you're right.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:31.644
If we lose Gamma City, we lose everything.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.846
Sire, the Vexos are on site...

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.449
they will protect the Gamma Controller at all costs.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.086
They'd better, Hydron.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.220
[annoyed sigh]

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.822
I told him I'd handle it...

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.291
But he worries about me too much.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.793
Still...

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.127
Mylene...

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.429
Yes? I'm here.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.530
Good...

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.432
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance will

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.601
be arriving quite soon.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:57.036
Those annoying kids are bold when they're together

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.707
but you've shown... how weak they are on their own.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.375
Divide and conquer.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.810
Yes, your highness.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:07.013
And be sure to save the last one for me, won't you?

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.781
You, Prince Hydron?

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:12.619
I have to put on a show for my father.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.689
So he can see how foolish it is to doubt my ability.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.791
I will make the arrangements.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.760
See that you do.

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.097
What a spoiled brat...

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.098
[dismissive grunt]

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:27.567
That should be good for a laugh.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.436
Are you reading me, Lync?

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.504
It's Hydron.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:32.772
Yes, Lync here.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:36.009
I want you to take care of something for me.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.077
Of course.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.081
Spectra should be returning to Gamma City soon.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.350
Tell him I want the mechanical Bakugan they've

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.718
been making for me

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.988
prepared for brawling as soon as possible.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.590
Yes, my Prince.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.658
[closed-mouth amused]

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.893
Prince Hydron has delusions of grandeur.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:54.894
Oh...

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.362
and one more thing...

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.666
Keep a very close eye on Spectra.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.469
He's becoming far too independent for my liking.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.505
I know he's up to something.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.476
Did you get that?

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.544
[amused laugh]

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.812
You've got a tough job.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.847
Since you are going to keep an eye on me you'd

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.783
better have this, Lync.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.556
It seems the time to strike is now.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:29.429
[closed-mouth confident chuckle]

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.697
Here we are.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.166
Gamma City.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.967
Whoa!

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.803
Ah man, look at the size of that Dimension

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.371
Controller!

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.873
No...It's not the controller, it's the

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.575
elevator that connects Gamma City to the

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.943
Vespalace.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.378
That's handy.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.713
Then where is...

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.347
the Dimension Controller?

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:51.484
It's down there!

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.753
The whole city's underground?

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.088
Oh yeah!

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.590
Gamma City is much more top-secret than Alpha and

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.525
Beta Cities.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.294
This was the first Dimension Controller to

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.496
land on New Vestroia.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.198
It's the strongest one of all.

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:06.666
Okay...

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.167
So how do we get inside?

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.635
That way.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.472
With the central elevator it's going to take us

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.742
straight down to the heart of Gamma city.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.244
For once, something that is easy!

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.346
Come on. Lets get the show on the road...

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.348
Wait Dan.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.050
This whole thing's too easy.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.785
Huh? What do you mean?

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.353
Just take a look around.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.122
What? Where?

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:32.358
The Vexos know we're coming but there's no security.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.162
Not a single guard.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.263
He's right...

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.365
It's like they're daring us to come inside.

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:40.600
They are.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.868
It's a trap.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.669
Now what?

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.438
I'd look for another way in...

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.472
but that's it.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:49.008
What do you say, Dan?

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:53.312
It's not like we have a choice...

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:56.482
We have one last Dimension Controller to destroy...

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.985
Then the Bakugan are free again.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.020
We didn't come this far to hang around outside.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.122
We've got to go all the way!

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.190
Dan...

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.291
let's go!

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.026
My head says we should be careful.

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.062
But then we'd only end up back in the same place.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.197
Yes!

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.365
Right!

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:13.366
Shun?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.700
Are you in?

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:15.902
All right...

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.069
But everyone...

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.271
you need to be on the lookout.

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.272
OK!

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:20.373
You've got it!

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.175
All right. Let's do this!

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.543
Oh yeah!

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.114
Okay, go!

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:38.791
[\u266a]

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.961
So this is the entrance to Gamma City?

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.163
Yo, Dan! Quick!

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.098
The main elevator's over there.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.500
Not so fast!

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.969
Who's that?

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.104
Volt?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.539
I wondered when you'd show.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.409
[battle yell]

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:59.545
If you want inside you'll have to get past me.

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:00.746
Yeah?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.114
Well, that shouldn't take very long.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.349
Gauntlet...

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.384
Power Strike!

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.253
Baron?

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.989
Nemus and I will take care of this.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.490

I'll hold him off, now go!

Okay!

We'll go on to smash the controller!

We have nothing to worry about.

This ability is more than illusion...

Jeel Frontier shuts down any ability.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.589
And not only that, it also subtracts two hundred from

Where are the people?

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:54.854
There aren't any.

Gamma City isn't a town.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.324
It's a Bakugan research facility.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:11:00.459

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:02.528
only respond to my commands.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:05.564
With these and Helios, I will control hold the most

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.667
powerful Combination Bakugan in the universe!

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.135
Even if he is fighting against the Perfect

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.603
Dragonoid, there is no

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.473
way Helios can lose!

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.041
[evil chuckle]

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:17.910
There is no one who can stand in my way...

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:21.647
Soon they will all kneel before me... the Vexos!

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.881
Prince Hydron!

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:25.017
And even the king himself!

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.820
After that there will be no limit to my power!

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.588
[full bodied evil laugh]

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.756
Oh Keith...

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.258
Only a few more adjustments and they'll be finished.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:34.426
Gus, Mira,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.429
take these Bakugan.

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:39.231
Use them in battle...

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:41.433
Then I want you to bring back the data on Percival

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.369
and Drago.

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.237
You want me to fight...?

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.840
All due respect, Master Spectra...

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.076
But are you sure it's safe to trust Mira?

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.545
Once again you are questioning me, Gus.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.813
It's just...

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.248
I don't think it's smart...

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.016
She is none of your concern...

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.752
Now activate the Trans system.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.253
Yes sir.

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:11.330
[\u266a]

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:20.973
[\u266a]

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.053
Take them and go.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:37.823
Dan Kuso and Ace will arrive soon.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.726
[\u266a]

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.227
What's the matter, Nemus?

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.796
[wild laugh]

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.297
Which one? Which one?

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.467
I'll use a Bakugan Trap to escape this trap...

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.602
Go Haos Guardian!

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.407
Changing up, noob?

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.675
Ability Activate!

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.044
Darkus Scythe!

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.013
Time to slice and dice!

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.681
[attack roar]

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:08.420
Hey freak, it's not safe waving that thing around...

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.055
Ability Activate!

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.958
Soliton Deflector.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.231
Now, Ability Activate!

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.733
Spark Roa!

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.869
That oughta bring you down.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:26.805
[agonized scream]

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:29.241
[\u266a]

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.312
There's still more where that came from.

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:35.180
Ability Activate!

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:36.882
Shadow Split!

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.050
[\u266a]

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.688
Choose or lose, Hades.

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:46.024
[confused roar]

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.759
[frustrated yell]

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.194
Just grab one. Any one!

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:52.264
If you can't keep it together, I'll take over...

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.299
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.868
Elico Stand!

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.402
Attribute change!

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.571
[battle roar]

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.808
Oh Yes! Haos Elico is here!

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.810
Ability Activate!

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.446
Now, Flash Freeze!

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.915
Ingram!

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:11.350
What's happening?

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.751
[gasp]

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.152
No!

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:15.621
[grunt]

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.890
[struggle]

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:18.924
Cowards!

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.594
Move it, Shadow Prove!

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.695
Shaaaaa!

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.330
Now for some serious grindage!

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:27.166
Ability Activate!

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.834
Phaser Trident!

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:33.472
[\u266a]

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:34.640
Okay Elfin...

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.308
You're on!

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.043
Bakugan Brawl!

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.411
Elfin Stand!

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:42.247
Attribute Change!

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.449
I'm in a Ventus kind of mood!

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.551
[ribbet]

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.352
Sun, wind and rain combine!

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.721
Ventus Elfin will blow you away.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.590
So hang on tight!

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:53.191
Ability Activate!

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.359

[happy, twirling cry]

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:58.797
[\u266a]

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.032
[ribbet] Getting dizzy?

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:03.201
[\u266a]

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:10.242
[withstanding explosion]

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:12.678
No.... What the?

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.147
Jamming Out reflects an opponent's attack right

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.481
back at them...

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.850
So thanks for taking Elico out!

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:22.120
Where's that from?

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.589
They're brawling.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.463
Guess this means it's my turn next.

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.468
It's just a little further.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.403
I hope the others are okay.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:39.905
We'll go back for them...

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:42.140
as soon as we finish here!

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:44.376
Dan! Up ahead!

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:47.980
If I were you I wouldn't worry about your friends.

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:51.683
It's Gus and... N-No way!

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:54.886
Mira!

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.221
Then it's true!

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:58.256
Okay Mira...

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.926
Prove you are loyal to Spectra...

00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:04.997
I want to see it with my own eyes.

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.401
I can't believe Mira, leader of the Resistance

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.870
has joined up with the Vexos!

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.506
And she's brawling with everything she's got.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:15.807
And she's got a lot!

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.977
Like, an army of Mechanical Bakugan.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.212
But we can't hold back!

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.913
We've gotta win this battle and demolish the

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:25.917
final Controller even if it means taking Mira down.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.420
Next time it's all brawlers on deck!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.589
We need every Bakugan we've got to shut the

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:31.990
Vexos down!

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.325
Come on, Percival!

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.526
Let's do this!

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.528
We're heating things up!

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:46.605
[\u266a]

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:56.248
