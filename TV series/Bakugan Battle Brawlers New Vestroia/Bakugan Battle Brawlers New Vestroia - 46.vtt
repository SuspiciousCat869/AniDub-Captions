DAN: After learning that Marucho's phantom data was

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.342
identical to his...

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.877
GAUNTLET: Ready, Jetkor.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.079
DAN: ...Keith convinced us to try Battle Gear.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.614
DAN: We hadn't had a chance to fully analyze

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:18.818
Drago's DNA so we used a hybrid version of Helios's Gear.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.954
Since it wasn't an exact match for Drago, it caused

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.356
some problems.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.159
DRAGO: [pain]

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:30.430

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:35.101
DRAGO: That's what I plan to do...Haaaaaah!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.871
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:41.241
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.276
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.477
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.714
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.549
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.917
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.952
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.487
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.626
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.595
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

It looks like King Zenoheld is planning a new mission.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.519
SHADOW PROVE: Well that's perfect timing.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:29.122
Things were just starting to get boring round here.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.290

ZENOHELD: Time to make those involved with the

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.637
destruction of the BT System pay for their crimes...

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.139
ZENOHELD: ...with the lethal powers of Professor

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.374
Clay's Alternative Weapons System.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.909
MYLENE: Alternative?

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.010
ZENOHELD: When it's completed we will harness

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.946
enough power to destroy Vestal and Earth.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.614
ZENOHELD: We'll be able to annihilate every living

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.416
thing that dares to oppose us.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.718
We will be unstoppable!

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.523
ZENOHELD: They will all weep such bitter tears

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.926
once they feel the full force of my mighty wrath!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.328
VOLT: Excuse me, sire.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.496
ZENOHELD: Hmmmm?

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.197
VOLT: The original plan was to get revenge against

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.533
the Brawlers who got us kicked out of Vestal.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.401
But this new mission of yours is wrong...

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.104
it involves the destruction of innocents.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.573
It's not cool to punish people who did nothing to harm us.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.774
I won't do it.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.042
MYLENE: Just stop it.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.777

PRINCE HYDRON: You're a soldier, Volt.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.216
Not a policy maker.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.284
All you need to do is be quiet and take

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.753
orders...like a good little doggie.

DAN: Huh?

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.747
DRAGO: Marucho's an expert with these things.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.049
Just let him do his work.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.584
DAN: I wasn't really thinking about that.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.652
BARON: Huh?

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.920
DAN: I was thinking that when the Battle Gear is

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.955
done, we're gonna be even badder than we are now!

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.324
Imagine that! Aren't you stoked, buddy?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.160
DRAGO: Yes, I've been thinking the same thing.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.598
MARUCHO: Okay, I'm going to start uploading the

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.401
data from Drago's last Brawl against you.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.937
KEITH: Fingers crossed that this is gonna work.

MARUCHO: It'll work, trust me...Mira, what's the

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.142
transfer rate cycling at?

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:33.212
KEITH: Is it stable? Huh?

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.581
KEITH: Mira?

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.683
MIRA: [gasp] Uh-oh. Zoned out, there.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.585
MIRA: Sorry, guys. Transfer cycling rate

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.520
is steady and solid.

MIRA: [gasp]

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.103
MIRA: Keith, you startled me.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.671
KEITH: You seem distracted.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.939
MIRA: [gasp]

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.241
I guess I've been thinking a lot about Father.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.544
KEITH: As long as he remains loyal to Zenoheld

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.446
he is our enemy, Mira.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.616
MIRA: I guess, but I can't help thinking that...

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.117
MIRA: ...well that I can convince Father to come

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.385
around just like you did.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.021
That way we could all be together as a family

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.357
again...Is that really such a crazy thing

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.994
to hope for, Keith?

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.263
KEITH: I know of a way you can contact him.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.898
MIRA: [gasp]

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.967
Is that...?

KEITH: I seriously doubt that

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.738
you'll persuade him to change sides...but if it'll

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.708
make you feel better...you should at least try.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.644

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.304
I really wanted to see you and he said it would help.

stopped when he gets like this.

MYLENE: I'm not saying I agree with him.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.484
I'm just saying that it's pointless to try and stop him.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.053
He's too powerful. Too crazy.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.392
VOLT: Then again, maybe it's me that's changed.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.860
VOLT: Every thing I've achieved...Everything I've

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:51.364
become...it's such a long way from where I started here.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:57.770
VOLT: My success is undeniable but still...

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:00.439
VOLT: It seems I may have actually lost...the most

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.608
valuable thing of all.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.145
VOLT: Huh?

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.214
VOLT: Is this yours?

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:09.515
GIRL D: Yes sir.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.152
GIRL D: Hey, are you that guy from the Vexos?

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.420
Volt right?

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.188
VOLT: You recognize me?

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.323
GIRL D: Of course!

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.925
It's not often that someone from around here

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.126
makes it as big as you.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.861
You're the man!

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.196
VOLT: But do you have any idea what we did?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.698
GIRL D: Oh, who cares, dude.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.533
You're still our number one hero!

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.768
VOLT: [gasp]

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.570
GIRL D: So are you back here to stay, Volt?

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.940
VOLT: Um...You bet!

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.876
GIRL D: Awesome! Can you teach me to Brawl like you?

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.377
VOLT: You mean with Bakugan?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.446
GIRL D: Mmmm-hmmm.When I grow up, I wanna be a

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:42.748
wicked Battle Brawler just like you.

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.684
VOLT: Sure, okay.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.152
GIRL D: Really? Promise?

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.854
VOLT: Yeah, I promise.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.957
GIRL D: You're the best, Volt!

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.825
VOLT: Hah! Thanks kid.

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:55.027
VOLT: You'd better run along now.

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:58.831
VOLT: I bet your mom is...probably wondering...

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.499
where you are.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.834
GIRL D: Hmhmm!

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:02.935
GIRL D: Hey Guys!

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.704
Volt said he was going to train me to Brawl!

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:10.443
VOLT: You can come out from your hiding spot now.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:14.380
PRINCE HYDRON: That was inspiring...

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.182
that speech you gave that kid.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.651
You're such a role model.

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:22.021
VOLT: What do you want? Tell me!

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:24.357
PRINCE HYDRON: [chuckle]

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.294
PRINCE HYDRON: It's show time, traitor! Bakugan Brawl!

[\u266a]

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.599
VOLT: I'm ready when you are, Hydron! Let's go!

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.535
PRINCE HYDRON: So was it a bittersweet homecoming for

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.770
you, Volt?

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.105
PRINCE HYDRON: This place is even worse than when

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.373
you left it.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.576
VOLT: Still...many people call it home.

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:46.145
VOLT: Good people, who I can't stand by and watch

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.948
you destroy...this ends here, Hydron.

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.085
PRINCE HYDRON: Does this mean that you're leaving the Vexos?

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.021
PRINCE HYDRON: I'm the one who pulled you out of this

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.122
stink hole.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.590
And this is how you repay me?

00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:00.426
You've got a funny way of showing loyalty, Volt.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.229
VOLT: I'm grateful for all you've done for me.

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.164
VOLT: But I just...can't follow you

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:09.001
blindly...without question anymore.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.202
PRINCE HYDRON: You know, I've always hated that

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.571
self righteous attitude of yours.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:17.610
VOLT: Okay...Hydron... So you wanna battle me then?

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.345
That's fine!

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:20.379

Why isn't the Murasame Blade working?

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.289
VOLT: The Odin Shield nullifies all abilities

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.257
that have been activated and it stops any other

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.226

But trust me, you won't be so lucky next time around.

I can promise you that much.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.928
away right now with our honor intact...and never

you...it's not that easy, Volt.

need to crush anyone who opposes me.

Who do you think you are?

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.779
VOLT: You're at a disadvantage because your

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.615
privileged upbringing means that battle has

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.983
always been a game.

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:23.075
How can that be?

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:29.515
[\u266a]

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.850
VOLT: Finish him.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.087
PRINCE HYDRON: Dryoid no!

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.056
GAUNTLET: Hydron Life force, zero.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.092
[\u266a]

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.394
PRINCE HYDRON: Wh, why don't you go...

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:43.996
PRINCE HYDRON: ... back to... [gasp]

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.330
...ball form...?

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:46.832
VOLT: It's the Custom battle

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:50.536
ability...I switched the mode settings during the brawl.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.870
PRINCE HYDRON: [angry grunt] I thought something

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.872
seemed strange!

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.475
VOLT: When this program is activated, the opponent's

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:58.610
battle energy is nullified.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:01.013
And even after the battle is finished my Bakugan

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:03.282
doesn't go back to ball form.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.050
PRINCE HYDRON: But that's not fair!

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.885
VOLT: I told you before Hydron.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:11.723
Battling to me...is about survival.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.126
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasps]

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:18.197
PRINCE HYDRON: [whimpering]

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.332
VOLT: You're finished, Hydron!

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.568
PRINCE HYDRON: Aaaaahhhhhhh!

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:35.848
[\u266a]

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:40.652
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasping, whimpering]

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:43.655
VOLT: Hmmmph!

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:48.227
VOLT: Leave now...I never want to see your face again.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:54.099
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasping, panting] I...can't believe...

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:59.037
PRINCE HYDRON: ...that I lost...to that guy...

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:02.374
PRINCE HYDRON: ...that I lost to a mere underling!

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:05.878
A servant!

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:10.082
PRINCE HYDRON: He's gonna pay!

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.686
VOLT: Whoa!

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.356
VOLT: What the...?!

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.091
VOLT: What's this? What's happening?

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:21.226
PRINCE HYDRON: I sentence you to eternity Volt, in

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.630
the far reaches of the dimension.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.498
VOLT: Worthless scum!

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:27.933
PRINCE HYDRON: Ahhhhhh!

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.635
VOLT: Let's take this trip together.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.503
What do you say, Hydron?

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:32.938
PRINCE HYDRON: Let go of me now!

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.673
VOLT: If I go, then you go!

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:37.576
PRINCE HYDRON: I mean it! Right now! Let go! Let go!

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:38.810
VOLT: Ahhhh!

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.947
PRINCE HYDRON: I said...Let gooooooooo!

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.081
PRINCE HYDRON: Haaaaaaaahhhh! [gasping, panting]

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.583
VOLT: [grunt, pain]

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.252
VOLT: This isn't over, Hydron...I promise you,

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:49.121
one day you will pay for all of the pain and misery

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.990
that you brought upon...the innocents of the world.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.293
PRINCE HYDRON: Silence!

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:57.162
PRINCE HYDRON: Enjoy your suffering!

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.597
[\u266a]

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.669
PRINCE HYDRON: [mad giggling]

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:06.538
PRINCE HYDRON: I did it...I won. I beat him.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:10.108
[mad cackling]

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:15.080
DAN: Battle Gear, Ability activate!

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.415
DAN: Jetkor!

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:17.683
DRAGO: [rising roar]

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.017
DAN: Kick iiiiiiiiiiit!

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.620
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:28.994
[\u266a]

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:31.263
KEITH/SPECTRA: Hmmmph. Success!

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.898
MARUCHO: So it looks like Drago's Battle Gear will

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.701
be...the Jetkor!

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.504
[\u266a]

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.673
ZENOHELD: So you took care of the traitor for me...

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:43.041
Good work.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.477
PRINCE HYDRON: He put up a bit of a fight, but it was

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.412
no big deal father.

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:50.215
ZENOHELD: This is a lesson to you all...Cross me and

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:52.284
you will pay dearly.

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:54.353
ZENOHELD: No matter who you are.

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.788
Friend, enemy or otherwise!

00:20:56.822 --> 00:20:59.324
ZENOHELD: I will show no mercy and your suffering

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:02.194
shall be legendary...throughout all

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.962
the dimensions!

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.134
LYNC: When King Zenoheld gave the order for Earth

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.236
to be destroyed, I was totally down with the program.

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.337
But then I remembered about that really nice

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:13.772
girl that I met named Alice.

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.207
It would be kind of a drag if she were one of the

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.742
casualties, so I thought I'd warn her.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.410
But then Hydron showed up and started sticking his

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.845
big nose in everything.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.413
LYNC: He thinks he's a lot tougher than he is, but he

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.814
doesn't scare me.

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.783
I'll throw down with him any day, especially if it means

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.019
rescuing a nice girl like Alice from the Alternative.

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:28.787
LYNC: Can you believe it? Me sticking up for an Earthling.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.357
Too much! You should tune in to check it out.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.426
LYNC: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.795
LYNC: Hey Alice!

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:46.872
[\u266a]

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:56.515
