KEITH/SPECTRA: I traveled to the Mother Palace

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.210
for one last attempt at destroying Zenoheld's

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.446
Alternative Weapon System, but unfortunately I was

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.014
too late.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.317
KEITH/SPECTRA: Once I saw it fully assembled it was

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.554
even more terrifying than I had ever imagined.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.223
KEITH/SPECTRA: Professor Clay had even figured out

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.160
a way to link it to FARBROS.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.862
KEITH/SPECTRA: Now it's up to Gus and I to destroy

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.730
this thing ourselves...

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:33.333
If only I hadn't left the Brawlers behind.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.168
We sure could use their help!

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.937
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.307
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.343
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.544
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.346
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.781
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.616
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.984
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.019
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.554
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.692
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.662
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.943
BARON: Have you found the Mother Palace yet?

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.612
MARUCHO: [sigh] Ah..no, it's harder than I thought.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.648
MIRA: After Keith took us there the last time...

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.050
we should have copied down the coordinates.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.518
DAN: How were we supposed to know.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.820
It's not like we thought we'd ever have to go back

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:29.055
there again.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.123
DAN: Wait a sec...

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.792
Drago, could your evolved powers transport us?

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.428
DRAGO: I'm not sure. I don't think so.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.896
MARUCHO: We'd still need some kind of precise

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.365
coordinates to make a jump like that.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.734
BARON: There must be something we can do.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.436
SHUN: The Dimension Transporter Gate...

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.437
BARON: Huh?

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.672
DAN: [gasp]

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.674
SHUN: Mylene and Shadow Prove used it to travel

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.008
here from the Palace.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.944
Wouldn't it leave some kind of breadcrumb trail?

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.412
MARUCHO: Maybe...

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.282
I think... If I do it right...

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.617
MARUCHO: I just might be able to track the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.752
signature data path it would have left behind in

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.822
the atmosphere.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.358
ACE: And there's our road map to the palace.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.394
JULIE: Uh wow. Nice one there Marucho!

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:09.529
MARUCHO: I should double-check the

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.331
calculations with Dr. Michael.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.732

JULIE: No here.

DAN: [frustrated] We still gotta try.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.453

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.626
DR. MICHAEL: Yes. We came as soon as we heard.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.027
Now let's get started.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.862
ALICE: Alright!

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.266
DR. MICHAEL: This is definitely the room where

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.035
the Vexos entered using the Dimensional Transporter.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.037
DAN: Hey, Alice. What's that funny thing on his head?

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.805
ALICE: It helps him find the residual...

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.208
...signature path from the Dimension Gate.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.476
DAN: And then?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.211
ALICE: Well Dan, with a precise location, we can

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.214
follow the path backward more easily.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.583
MARUCHO: And, it's like following a set of footprints.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.817
DR. MICHAEL: [gasp]

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.952
DR. MICHAEL: There are wavelengths present but

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.620
they're weak.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:10.223
DR. MICHAEL: This may take more than a little while.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.659
DR. MICHAEL: Alice! Marucho! I need your help!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.427
ALICE/MARUCHO: Yes sir.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.663
MIRA: Why would Keith just go and run off like that?

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.331
Maybe if I had been paying more attention I would

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.466
have seen that something was wrong.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.769
DAN: Don't be so hard on yourself, Mira.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.871
Dr. Michael will figure out the pathway soon

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.606
enough and then we'll go find him.

RUNO: Listen you insensitive, jerk...

RUNO: You wouldn't know this because you're always

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.890
the first to charge into battle...

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.793
