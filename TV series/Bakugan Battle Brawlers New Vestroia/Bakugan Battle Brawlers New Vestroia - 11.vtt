WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.542
Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.444
So we joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.645
Resistance.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.348
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.752
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.454
Every battle makes us stronger and brings us

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.990
closer to our goal.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.925
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.794
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.063
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.931
We're ready to roll...

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.901
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:44.978
[\u266a]

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:54.621
[\u266a]

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.668
[\u266a]

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.736
Lync?

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.237
Look out!

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.076
Got to stop them...

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.510
Let's go!

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.845
I'm coming, Runo!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.079
This is a bad idea!

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.080
Wait for me!

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.849
Wahooooo!

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:26.786
I told her not to go.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.555
But would she listen? Nooo!

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.789
Is that?

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:30.957
It's Runo!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.792
Brace... yourself!

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.796
Runo!

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.965
Catch me, Julie!

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.103
Don't ever do that again....

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.404
Welcome back, Runo...

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.307
[yelling]

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.909
[impact]

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.511
[impact grunt]

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.148
Dan!

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.249
You're back!

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.685
Uh... Hi guys...

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.887
Just thought I'd drop by for a visit.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.522
Hey Girls...

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.425
meet the Bakugan Resistance.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.726
Hi there...

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.362
Looks like... we have company.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.369
Vexos!

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.403
Worst boy band...

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.671
ever.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.875
[\u266a]

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.678
The Bakugan Battler Brawlers in \"Gate Crashers\".

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.682
The others took off so I'll crush you instead!

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.417
Ability Activate!

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.286
Darkus Stream!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.454
Yeeeeeaaahhh!

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.490
Power Level 100.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.058
Afraid of the dark, pipsqueak?

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.293
Am not!

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.794
I brought my own nightlight...

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.464
Elfin! It's time to wake up!

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.866
I like the way you're thinking, Marucho...

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.635
Time to change Attributes.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.904
Sun, wind and rain combine!

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.606
Darkus Elfin is gonna sing you a lullabye.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.176
Nighty night!

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.810
Ability Activate!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.113
Moon Rainbow!

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:01.180
I'm your worst nightmare...

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.049
So say your prayers.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.952
[\u266a]

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.654
[painful roar]

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.657
[\u266a]

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.659
You think you're so big, Peewee!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.194
Big enough to win...

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.728
Had enough, goofball?

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.263
No fair!

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.898
That was pretty pathetic.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.134
Even for you.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.170
Let's go before you embarrass yourself more.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.740
[\u266a]

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:28.975
What the?

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.144
Who's afraid now?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.547
Buh bye, Shadow Prove.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:38.251
I hope Dan and the others made it through the Gate all right.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.520
We'll just... have to wait.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.389
Since we can't seem to hear the voices anymore...

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.259
the Gate must have closed behind them...

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.762
So until they're back, it's up to the three of us...

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.764
Got a problem with that?

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.066
Yeah, I do...

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.067
We're a team.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.368
You don't just take off.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.370
Give it a rest, Ace...

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.773
We'll destroy the Dimension Controller at Beta City...

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.875
That should pass the time...

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.444
Unless you're afraid.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.678
As if...

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:09.148
Maybe we'll free all the Bakugan by the time they get back.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.950
Now you're talkin'

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.619
Get this straight, guys...

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:15.688
This is my home turf and you're not welcome.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:16.823
Hear that...

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.458
Mighty Spectra?

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.660
We're not wanted here on Earth.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.528
You got that right!

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:23.563
Fine then...

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.866
I'll go but I want souvenir!

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.001
[frightened scream]

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.235
You feathered freak!

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:30.370
\"Watch your mouth\"

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:35.908
...Runo!

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.586
Hey, four eyes!

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.087
Because you didn't get your act together,

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.423
I got squashed by that little dweeb.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.158
I want the heavy artillery.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.327
Where's my mechanical Bakugan?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.562
Soon. Soon.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.830
Do you mind?

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.332
I bruise easily.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.301
[dismissive laugh] I'm going to leave you boys alone.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:04.704
Runo?

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:05.805
Hey Runo!

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.407
We'll find her, Master Dan!

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.408
[running panting]

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.509
We better!

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.777
There's no more tracks!

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.112
It's like they just disappeared.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.380
We better split up.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.481
Good idea...

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.283
Julie and I will cover the north forest...

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.885
You two cover the west...

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:19.952
Okay...

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.120
Sounds good...

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.388
Let's go...

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.527
Great. So now we're stranded on an ice cube planet in some

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.562
other universe.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.963
Of course it figures...

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.765
that Spectra couldn't transport us to a beach

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:33.933
somewhere...

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.501
What is your problem?

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.504
Well, well.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.039
It's Spectra's little pet.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.741
Runo!

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.309
Daaan!

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.678
Dan! Look up there!

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.483
[\u266a]

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.018
You better not hurt her, Spectra.

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.553
Or you're history!

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.388
No need for theatrics...

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.657
Your friend is safe.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.093
What do you want?

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.761
Come join the Vexos, Dan...

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.496
It's that simple.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.997
Forget it!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.232
Poor Gus.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.967
You look lost without your master.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.002
Let's see how tough you are...

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.070
[smug laugh]

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.539
... when Spectra's not here to back you.

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:16.809
Spectra may trust you now, but you're still a snake...

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.045
Why don't you slither back into your hole?

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.246
[smug laugh]

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.715
...That's real funny coming from Spectra's lap dog...

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.118
Did he let you off the leash or did you lose him when he

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.953
took you out for a walk?

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:27.954
[mocking chuckle]

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.088
That's it...

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.357
Your mouth is the only dangerous thing about you.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.426
There's one way to find out.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.861
Hold it... right there!

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.263
Where is Spectra?

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.465
You're brawling?

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.400
Trouble... in paradise?

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:42.935
Go ahead. Rip into each other.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.103
I don't care...

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.304
Just tell us where...

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.407
Spectra took our friend, Runo.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.474
Who knows?

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.776
Why don't you ask, Gus here?

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.677
Hey, Get back here!

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.780
[sigh]

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.915
Just me... and you now...

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.984
But you're not even worth my time.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.252
Say what?

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.220
I promised Hydron I'd spy on those two but since they're

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.855
gone...

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.191
I'll take your Bakugan instead...

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.492
Shouldn't be too hard to do.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.327
You're the weakest Brawler here.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.629
Well, Baron?

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.897
Wanna try and...

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.765
prove me wrong?

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.068
How's it coming, Grandfather?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.236
Not bad...

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.405
I think it's still in working order, Alice.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:20.807
That's great!

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.608
So then we can use the Transporter...

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.278
to send those Vexos back to New Vestroia once the others

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.547
save Runo, right?

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.016
Considering the damage they've done to New Vestroia,

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.717
the faster they return...

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:33.286
the better off Earth will be.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.388
There's only one problem now...

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.857
How do we find them and bring them here to send them

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.393
back to their own dimension?

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.729
I know exactly how we can do it!

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:44.997
Leave it to me!

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.732
Gus, wait!

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.071
Oh no...

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:53.706
Join you?

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.274
Have you lost it?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.843
We share a goal...

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:58.845
to save the Bakugan.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.112
Yeah right.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.347
It's true, human...

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.383
Prince Hydron's your true enemy.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:07.320
Prince... Hydron?

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.288
Vestal's prince...

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.291
He's the one who rules over of New Vestroia.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.593
So what?

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.294
If we join forces...

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.430
we can end Hydron's threat.

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:23.736
Could Spectra actually be working to save the Bakugan?

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.705
If that's true then...

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:28.574
...Spectra really could be my brother, Keith,

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:32.778
infiltrating the Vexos to get to Hydron!

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.980
Mira, hold it!

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.381
Don't trust him!

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:37.884
First you take Runo and now you want to team up?

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.118
Yeah! Not cool!

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:40.553
Then I will show good faith...

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.621
The girl is yours.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.091
Dan! Julie!

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.894
You might be interested to know your former Bakugan now

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:50.229
belong to Hydron.

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:53.499
They are now giant, bronze statues decorating his

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:54.901
throne room.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.169
He's quite proud of his collection.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.304
No way!

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.739
Statues?

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:03.442
Yes. Five of the Six Fighting Bakugan stand as an example

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:07.146
to anyone who dares to defy his rule.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.382
Oh no... Gorem!

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.883
That does it!

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.184

Nothing is as it seems!

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:19.592
It's crunch time!

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.627
Those Vexos are finito!

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.464
Are you gonna brawl or make a snow man?

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.867
Let's see how tough you are without Spectra.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.702
Take your best shot.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.367
That was too easy.

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:36.969

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.985
Spectra will rule, with me at his side.

But...

They're going for it.

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.368

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:12.137
Can we afford not to join forces?

I want to believe him.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.175
Don't listen to him!

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:21.046
Even if what you say is true we'll never join the Vexos!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.948
You're the ones who invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.583
the Bakugan...

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.652
First you take their world, then you treat them like

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.653
animals.

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.088
There's no way we'll work with you!

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.622
Right, Mira?

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:31.824
Wha...? Yeah.

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:35.060
Your so called 'friend' Mira is a Vestal too.

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:37.996
You can forge an alliance with her and not with me?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.631
I gave you your friend back.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:41.333
I'm talking, not brawling...

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.635
What more proof do you need?

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.538
Free the Bakugan first and I'll believe.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.774
Not till we bring down Hydron!

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:49.908
What's the matter?

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.677
You afraid to give up all your power?

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.947
That's why we'll never trust you, Spectra!

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.349
Alice?

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.218
Freaky! How'd you do that?

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:00.853
Remember?

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:04.423
This is the card Masquerade used to transport himself.

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:07.426
I used it to help me find you guys and warp me here...

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.961
Now as for you two...

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.130
You're taking another trip.

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.098
A trip?

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.267
Alice, wait!

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.302
What are you doing?

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.905
[\u266a]

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.508
Alice!

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:28.747
Dan, Alice! Get out of there! Now!

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:41.894
Aaaaahhh!

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.495
Gus!

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.904
Man, that was close.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.572
Pretty good reflexes, Dan.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.907
I'm okay.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.708
You can let me go any time now.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:59.044
Huh?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.447
It's shorting out!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.848
Got it!

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:12.925
[\u266a]

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:19.965
[\u266a]

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:23.268
So, Spectra and Gus have been sent back to New Vestroia?

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.103
I guess they're out of our hair for now.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.206
Baron... Where's Lync?

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:28.774
Well you've got me...

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.976
Once I trashed his Bakugan...

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:34.146
He took off into the woods and I completely lost him.

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.949
I'm afraid that last warp was too much for the

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.984
Dimensional Transporter.

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:41.386
I'll have to rebuild it from scratch before I can send

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.689
anyone back again.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.958
What? My parents...

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.359
they'll ground me for staying over in another

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:49.128
dimension!

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.363
And what about our Bakugan pals?

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:53.332
Hydron turned them into statues!

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:57.169
We must complete our mission to free all the Bakugan.

00:18:57.202 --> 00:18:59.204
Please Dr. Michael. Can't you fix it?

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:00.839
Just enough for one more trip?

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.040
I think so, Dan...

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.376
But it will take me some time.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.813
Then... What do we do while you're fixing it?

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.381
Slumber party!

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:11.283
We'll make a new plan to save the Bakugan...

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.886
and have popcorn and watch movies!

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.287
Are you for real?

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.523
A whole planet's at stake here!

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.458
This isn't a party, Julie!

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.193
We need a serious strategy.

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.961
We can do it at my house...

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.162
Okay?

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.732
It's more than okay, Master Dan!

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:28.400
It's... awesome...

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.135
Totally awesome!

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:32.204
Uh.. Okay then.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:37.876
Hey! Looks like our ride is here!

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:43.048
[\u266a]

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.550
See you... Good Luck!

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.218
Goodbye, Alice!

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.120
We're counting on you, Dr. Michael.

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.788
Don't worry.

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.030
Lync!

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.264
Hey!

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.732
It looks like you're stuck here with the rest of us for

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.200
a while.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.201
Yeah...

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.736
A little birdie told me.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.439
So what are you going to do?

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:10.275
Wanna come with us?

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.710
Like I need you...

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:14.479
I can find my own way back without you amateurs.

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:16.748
Whatever! Suit yourself then...

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.584
We're outta here

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.224
Safe journey!

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:35.467
[\u266a]

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.702
Forget it...

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.103
There's nothing that could make me want anything to do

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.538
with you.

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.840
[stomach growls]

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:54.419
As soon as the Transporter is repaired...

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.755
you are so gone. [closed-mouth hmmmph!]

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.297
[sad, soft crying]

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.301
Mira here.

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:10.969
Looks like Baron and I are stuck on Earth.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.804
But Dan and his friends are eager to show off their

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.240
world by taking us to an amusement park,

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.075
whatever that is.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:21.079
So how is it I end up brawling against Spectra and Gus?

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.614
I challenge you...

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.650
if you're brave enough.

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:27.119
If I win, Spectra takes off his mask.

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.554
But if I lose, I have to join the Vexos and maybe

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:32.291
even fight against my own friends!

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.725
But I'm not gonna lose!

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:34.826
Be there!

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.495
And bring... your Bakugan!

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:46.571
[\u266a]

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:56.214
[\u266a]
