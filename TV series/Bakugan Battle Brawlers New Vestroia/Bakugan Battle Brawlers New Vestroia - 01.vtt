WEBVTT

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:13.780
DAN: I still can't believe we said goodbye to our Bakugan.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.082
But after battling with us to save Earth,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.418
Drago still had to unite the Bakugan's

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.720
splintered homeworld.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.523
And the only way to do that was to become the new core

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.826
of New Vestroia himself.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.562
With the six realms of Vestroia reunited,

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.464
our friends could finally return home

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.166
to the world of the Bakugan...

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.338
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.743
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.780
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.016
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.453
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.257
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.464
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.334
DAN: Our Bakugan buddies were enjoying peace

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.771
on New Vestroia for the first time in centuries.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.877
Ahhhhh!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.514
DAN: But I guess all good things have to come to an end.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:31.591
[\u266a]

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:39.399
[\u266a]

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.967
By the spirits!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.044
[\u266a]

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:56.082
[\u266a]

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.283
[screams]

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.486
Coming through!

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.788
Noooo!

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.762
They've trapped us.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.564
We're helpless!

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.269
Can't... resist!

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.371
Noooo!

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.381
[evil chuckle]

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.195
Huh?

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.098
Everything's slowing...

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.466
Whoa!

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.700
Am I seeing things?

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.969
Is that... Vestroia?

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.273
No way.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.979
Mommy, wait for me.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.748
Huh... That was weird.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.083
Something's not right. I can feel it.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.388
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.893
Give up, Baron?

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.395
As if!

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.633
Ability activate!

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.302
Pyra-might!

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.238
Skid Roa!

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.174
Take them... Helios.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.343
Ability activate...

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.178
Burst Core!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:42.989
[\u266a]

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.091
Nemus!

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.359
Focus, Baron.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.795
We have a battle to win.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.963
You're right...

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.265
Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.902
[Roar]

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.237
Now you must answer to Tigrerra!

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:03.076
So you are the last of the new Six Fighting Bakugans.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.446
I may be the last, but Drago and Wavern sacrificed

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.848
too much for this world to let you take it

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.450
without a fight...

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.686
Right Baron? [Roar]

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.290
Ability activate!

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.329
Velocity Fang!

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.331
[\u266a]

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.699
That... tickles!

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:27.900
What?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.302
You're still standing?

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.571
As long as the Burst Core is active...

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.474
All of your power is useless, Tigrerra.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.977
[\u266a]

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.381
Say goodbye to the last of the Bakugan Six.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.983
Baron, do something!

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.386
Right! Ability activate!

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.622
No one can hide from the light of my...

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.991
Shining Force!

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.128
Don't you get it?

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.130
Helios and I are...

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.665
Invincible!

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.502
Ability activate.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:05.371
General Quasar!

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.642
Nemus! Move!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.145
Tigrerra!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.983
I'm sorry Drago... I've failed you.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.184
[glass breaks]

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:22.555
Oh no. My favourite picture.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:25.725
The crack runs right through Tigrerra.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.831
I lost.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.433
M-hmm.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.802
And now I'll take your Bakugan.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.408
DRAGO: Tigrerra too?

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.811
Is this to be my fate?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.180
I ask you ancestors,

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:50.583
am I doomed to watch my friends fall defending the world

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:54.520
I sacrificed everything to protect?

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.456
Answer me!

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.858
We hear you, Drago.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.994
And we have come.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.030
We are with you in the Core.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:06.232
DRAGO: The ancient warriors of Vestroia?

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.734
Then there is hope!

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.936
There is always hope.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.139
Each of us sacrificed much to save our world.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:18.211
Just as you have sacrificed, oh courageous Drago.

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:22.715
But now New Vestroia faces a danger unlike any other.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.717
And in this time of time of need,

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:28.654
we ask you to sacrifice once again, young dragonoid.

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:32.692
You are the only one who can save our world now.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.027
DRAGO: But what can I do?

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.029
I'm not a dragonoid any more.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.566
I am the Perfect Core that balances and binds the world.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.202
If I were to leave, New Vestroia would separate

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.038
and that would mean the end of everything.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.174
There is a way.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:52.412
If we combine our power you can separate from the Core

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.914
and regenerate your body.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.983
But what of New Vestroia?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.452
You must leave behind enough energy

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.654
to sustain the Core, Drago.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.256
But it can be done.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.424
Then we must do it right away!

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.459
Agreed...

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.362
But you must accept the consequences.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.364
Once you are separated from the Core,

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.666
you will not be as powerful as you once were,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.434
and you will not look the same.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.670
None of that matters.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:21.007
I'd give anything to battle for our world again...

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.909
Help me ancient warriors.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.645
Help me to save New Vestroia!

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:28.214
Very well, Drago.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:29.982
[Drago screams]

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.885
I feel like I'm being ripped apart!

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.989
You must endure, Drago!

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.291
It is done.

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:39.392
Remember Drago.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:41.327
You cannot find victory alone.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.362
You will need a partner.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:46.365
May fate smile on you and the one you choose.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.634
DRAGO: Ha! I don't have to choose.

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.771
There's only one human I would ever call partner!

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.883
You called... my prince?

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:07.587
Spectra, this sudden thunder is most distressing.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.255
Where did it come from?

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:13.059
There seems to be a disturbance in the Perfect Core.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.495
But I believe it will pass shortly.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.964
I see...

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.299
I don't like thunder...

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.336
I don't like surprises either, Spectra.

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.137
DAN: I left a message for Shun.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.173
But he hasn't returned my call.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:28.274
He never does.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.109
Is that a ninja thing or what?

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.678
You probably lost your cool and annoyed him again.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.347
I never lose my cool!

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.715
Boring!

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.552
Are those two pretending to hate each other again...

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.187
Change the channel!

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.090
Why don't you try Shun one more time?

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:47.159
I've already called him like, a billion times.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.628
Still can't connect.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.363
Something is interfering.

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.498
[scream]

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.168
Whoa!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.837
No, it can't be!

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.539
DRAGO: Sure it can, Dan!

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.941
Everything is possible!

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.910
[laughter]

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.344
A... Bakugan!

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.747
But which one?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.815
Hello, Daniel

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.918
Drago?

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.019
Is that you, man?

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.287
Of course...

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.822
Who else could make an entrance like that?

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:21.827
Drago's back! Drago's back! Drago's back!

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.330
Is it true?

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.399
I can't believe it, Drago's really back?

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.234
He is! Take a look!

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.336
It's good to see you Brawlers.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.938
All of you.

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:33.306
Hooray! Hooray!

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:34.840
Umm...Drago...

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.442
Can Gorem come visit too?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.777
And what about Tigrerra?

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.945
How's Preyas?

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.013
I can't wait to see him again, Drago!

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.348
I'm sorry.

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:44.283
I'm not here for a visit.

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.953
I'm here to ask for your help.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.287
What's happened?

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.289
New Vestroia has been invaded.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.259
Most of the Bakugan have been captured and enslaved.

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.360
[gasps]

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:55.761
Are you kidding?

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:56.896
It's no joke.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.531
That's why I came to you, Dan.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.099
I can't save them alone.

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.267
Drago...

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.035
Will you help me, Dan?

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.705
Hello! You bet I will!

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:08.040
We'll make those \"spaced\" invaders wish they'd never

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.875
heard of Dan and Drago!

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:10.910
And Runo!

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.178
And Julie!

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.546
Yes!

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.915
We're all here to help, Drago.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.149
Thank you...

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:21.420
The first thing you can do to help me is to turn around.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.488
All of you.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:23.789
Okay.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:24.924
Since when was he so shy?

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.059
Dan, I can't take the others.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:30.162
It's got to be you and I alone.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.230
I'm sorry.

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:32.698
We have to go now, Dan.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:33.733
Hurry.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.634
What? But... Okay.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.704
Can we turn around yet, Drago?

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:42.108
How long does it take for a Bakugan to change anyway?

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.310
[gasp]

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.145
Those rats ditched us!

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.514
Either that or they're digging a pool!

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:49.615
No fair!

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.417
Come on you guys, take us with you!

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.686
I don't believe it!

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:54.820
Sorry, Dan.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.822
I don't want to get you in trouble with the others.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.691
Ahhh... We're cool, Drago.

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:02.028
I'm taking a big risk contacting humans again.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.665
I know I can count on you but I can't put the others

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.400
in harm's way.

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.335
It's just too dangerous.

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:11.937
MARUCHO: Sounds more like you're hogging all the fun!

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.639
HUH?

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:14.640
BOTH: Marucho?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.609
No sneaking away on me!

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:18.277
I'm coming with you guys!

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.645
Isn't it awesome?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.381
DAN: Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.353
MIRA: Welcome back to the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.959
So the Vexos took down Tigrerra too...

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.363
Well, at least Nemus is safe.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:38.898
Thank you, Baron...

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.267
Come back and get some rest...

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.102
What's up, Ace?

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:47.373
An unidentified Bakugan in quadrant G1.

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:51.877
Looks like he's brought along two humans for company.

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:56.182
Those kids won't last ten minutes out there.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.617
[THINKING]: That makes no sense...

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.053
DAN: So this is New Vestroia?

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:04.290
MARUCHO: I remember it being kind of greener.

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:07.093
Tell us what happened to your home, Drago.

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:09.628
It was a paradise before...

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.397
before they came.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.765
Sorry Drago...

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.400
You must have felt pretty helpless

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:17.103
having to watch all this happen.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:20.139
I did... [sigh]

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:23.109
Let me start at the beginning...

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.878
One day, with no warning,

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:29.181
alien ships descended upon our land...

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:31.784
They called themselves the Vestals

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.919
and they came to stay...

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:37.289
They planted their cities, one after another in our earth...

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:41.227
With no regard for life as we knew it.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.329
They transmitted a destructive energy field

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:45.464
across New Vestroia.

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.433
An energy which changed the molecular balance

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.835
of everything in its path.

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:52.404
This energy also transformed all the Bakugan

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.573
back into spheres.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.610
Is that so they could overpower you easily?

00:12:57.643 --> 00:13:01.046
Yes, then they began to capture all the Bakugan.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.082
One after another...

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:07.887
Preyas... Gorem... Skyress... Hydranoid...

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.622
Tigrerra...

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.891
All gone.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.126
But that's just plain rude!

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.561
That's so rank...

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:18.097
If they think they can just waltz onto this planet...

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.132
And take over the Bakugan

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.401
then they'll have to answer to me...

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:23.903
You hear me?

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:24.970
I hear you.

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.605
But what're you going to do about it?

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:31.644
Just who I was looking for.

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:34.180
Go home to your toys... children.

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:36.582
You better go back to where you came from.

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.918
Surrender to you?

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.253
[maniacal laugh]

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:42.721
This I gotta see.

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:45.925
Pretty big talk for a little kid...

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.127
Come on, show me whatcha got.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.596
I'll send you home crying to your mommies.

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.432
Yeah, you better pay attention to what he says...

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.701
Dan and Drago are the greatest Bakugan Brawlers

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.236
in the universe.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.071
What do you think, Volt?

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.673
Should we waste some time teaching these little

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.308
squirts a lesson?

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.776
It should be easy.

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:05.211
They don't have gauntlets.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.146
What are gauntlets?

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.681
Eh, who needs them...

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:10.316
All I need is Drago.

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:14.954
[laughs] Tooo funny!

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.959
[screams]

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.395
Not her again...

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:26.098
I don't know where you come from

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.433
or what you're doing here...

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:30.903
But you'll need a gauntlet to brawl in New Vestroia.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:33.839
I don't take orders from Vestals.

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:37.343
I lead the Bakugan Brawler Resistance...

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.144
My name is Mira.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:40.512
You're pretty...

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.615
and scary...

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.721
First let's see if you can keep up...

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.289
against the Vexos.

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.258
The Vexos?

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.361
MIRA: Yes, they're Vestals' top Bakugan Brawlers.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.162
The big one with no brains is Volt.

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.365
The baby who thinks he's cool is Lync.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.166
Hey... Watch your mouth.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.635
Like he said.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.203
They're mine.

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.739
So human...

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:09.074
Tell me, are you a chicken or a Brawler?

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.609
I'm no chicken!

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.944
Come on. Let me at those creeps...

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.513
I'll show them!

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.615
Fine... Let's go.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.251
Finally the talking stops.

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:21.120
We accept your challenge.

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:23.289
It's almost too easy...

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.590
to be fun.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.624
Want fun?

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:29.261
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet activated.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:30.562
Gauntlet Power Strike!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.264
BOTH: Power Strike!

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.800
How's this work?

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:35.801
Push this?

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:36.835
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet activated.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:40.239
Now the Ability Card.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.440
I rock!

00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:43.742
MIRA: This dweeb has no idea what he's doing.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:47.212
I can't believe I've sunk this low.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.781
Show them what you're made of!

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.249
Right!

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.618
I'm first... Okay kiddies?

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.753
Gate card set!

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:59.525
Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.293
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:04.363
Ventos Fly Beetle!

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:10.135
Bakugan Brawl! Bakugan Stand!

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:12.371
Haos Verias!

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.572
Hoo! Hah!

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.774
Hiyeeeeeee! Oh yeah!

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.176
What are you waiting for?

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:18.510
Christmas?

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.746
MIRA: I don't need an invitation to crash your party.

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.681
I'll take the lead. You follow...

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.116
Watch carefully.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.352
Hey kid, when are you gonna stop hiding behind Mira

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.253
and come out and play?

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.621
Why you!

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.689
Cool down, hot head!

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.224
No one calls me a coward!

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:34.460
We do! Ha!

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:36.295
Ready, pal? Ready.

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:39.264
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.633
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.169
Ow! Ow! Oooowww!

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:45.604
What is that?

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:48.107
Fly Beetle! Look out!

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.175
Got 'em now!

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.510
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.312
Ability Activate!

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:59.284
DRAGO: Burning Dragon!

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.087
I don't believe it...

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.123
He beat them both!

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.326
Drago!

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.428
How does it feel to be back in the saddle?

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.729
Great Dan!

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.197
I've missed you, partner!

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.166
Lookin' good, Buddy!

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:17.069
Feeling good!

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:20.873
MIRA: Lync's Life Gauge dropped by half with just one blow!

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:24.143
He's the most powerful Brawler I've ever seen.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.912
Hey... What is a Life Gauge, anyway?

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.515
MIRA: Whatever power level you lose in battle,

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.550
your Life Gauge goes down as well.

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.752
And when it hits zero, you've lost.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:35.287
I like this...

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.156
A Bakugan breakthrough...

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:40.159
A clean, clear way to decide who the winner will be.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.593
What are you looking at?

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.595
A partner who's a show off...

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.697
Come on... We've got to win this game.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.399
I know that Bakugan...

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.568
Drago? Drago?

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.603
Where have I heard that name before?

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:52.938
It's my turn to play...

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:55.374
Gate card set!

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.878
Bakugan Brawl! Bakugan Stand!

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.915
Subterra Willda!

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.617
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.686
Bakugan Stand!

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.521
Haos Freezer!

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.657
I've got your number, Mira!

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.525
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.093
Bakugan Stand!

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.229
Ventus Atmos!

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.831
Gate card open!

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.599
Subterra Reactor!

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.367
GAUNTLET: Power level increase detected.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.136
You think you're so clever...

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.071
Ability Activate!

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:28.807
Typhoon Chase!

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:30.576
GAUNTLET: Power level increase.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.045
Man! He really is a blowhard!

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:34.513
Double ability, activate.

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.681
No way!

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.649
GAUNTLET: Ability card set!

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:40.119
Power Winder Plus Gun Lock!

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:44.122
GAUNTLET: Power surge detected.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.357
Amazing!

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.993
She activated two abilities at the same time!

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.161
Awesome...

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:50.562
I didn't know it was possible.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.264
I'll take care of this one, kid...

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.833
You've got a few things to learn.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.168
Say what?

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.237
Fine. I'll just sit here...

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.405
There's so much I've got to learn from you, teacher.

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:02.174
DRAGO: Calm down.

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.175
Yeah, calm down.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.743
Man, he is such a baby...

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:06.378
That's his problem...

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:07.746
Let's go!

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.848
Go! Willda attack!

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:14.386
Bring it! Ability Activate!

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:17.222
Freeze Jail!

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.490
Oh no!

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.092
You take too much for granted.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.261
Abilities don't help if you can't use them!

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.495
Go Atmos!

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.797
Freezer!

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.166
Willda!

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.334
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:31.703
Bakugan Stand!

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:35.140
Maybe you should watch and learn...

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.409
Time to activate ability...

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:39.645
Double ability, that is!

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.146
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.915
Burst Shield plus...

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.616
Burning Dragon!

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.418
Let's go, Drago!

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:48.921
Drago...

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.524
GAUNTLET: Power loss detected.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.626
Oh yeah! That did the trick.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.196
MARUCHO: Nice work with the gauntlet, Dan!

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.331
I'm back in the battle!

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.266
MIRA: Who is this human?

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.936
He captured two Bakugan in one brawl

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.504
and didn't even break a sweat.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:08.907
He used a gauntlet and executed a combination

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.277
Ability attack perfectly on his very first try.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:15.614
That should have taken hours of practice to even start.

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.182
LYNC: I remember now.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:20.018
That, my friend, is one of the six fighting Bakugan

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.554
who saved Vestroia...

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.624
Meet Pyrus Draganoid, Ya Salamander.

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.093
Then you two must be...

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.562
I'm Dan Kuso... At your service.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.664
I'm Choji Marukura...

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.600
But call me Marucho.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.635
Dan... Marucho...

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:38.103
Now it's clear.

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.439
You're part of the Six Bakugan Brawlers.

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:42.608
Well, we're two of them anyway...

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.543
Whaddya think, Marucho...

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.511
Sounds like we've become famous.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:47.980
Pretty cool.

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.348
Except we didn't even know it.

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.983
Famous shmamous...

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:52.651
They're still toast.

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:55.320
Next time we'll get your autographs.

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:58.223
Sure! Just run away.

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.524
Come back, cowards!

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:02.227
MIRA: With these two on our side, maybe,

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:06.565
just maybe we have a chance to save New Vestroia after all.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:11.403
DAN: Next time Mira fills us in on the Bakugan Brawler

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.438
Resistance and their struggle against the Vexos

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.073
for New Vestroia.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:17.209
Then this hot shot, Ace, challenges me and Drago

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:18.877
to a grudge match.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.278
Even though he's on Mira's team,

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.047
he doesn't like outsiders like us.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.282
Whatever!

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.683
I'm always up for a Brawl.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.785
Can Drago and I show Ace who's boss?

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:28.453
Check out the next Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:29.888
and find out!

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.990
Don't miss... Facing Ace!

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.226
Drago! Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.761
Catch you later.
