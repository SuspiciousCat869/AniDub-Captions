00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.674
DAN: Just after we had finished destroying King

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:11.044
Zenoheld's BT System we were faced with another battle.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.445
DAN: Spectra was determined to prove that

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.581
Helios was the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.383
DAN: Too bad for them, Drago brought the pain and

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.785
laid him out once and for all.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.554
HELIOS: Drago...you are the ultimate Bakugan...You

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.758
are number one.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.160
DAN: Believe it or not, even Spectra decided to

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.796
quit fighting us and come over to the Brawlers' side.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.432
He actually joined our team.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.402
SPECTRA: Things are looking...brighter.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.171
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.541
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.778
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.579
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.849
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.217
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.253
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.788
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.926
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.896
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.230
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

be true.

MIRA: Uh...well, y'know...

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.086
KEITH: Good morning, Mira.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.969
KEITH: [giggle]

KEITH: [laughter]

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.674
BARON: Would you look at those two.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.476
BARON: It looks like they're totally back to

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.643
normal with each other.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.011
BARON: They're both acting as though the whole

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.180
Spectra thing never happened.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.615
MARUCHO: Spectra's dead now, so we should all act

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.983
that way.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.086
DAN: Yup...He's Keith now.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.356
DAN: The newest member of the Battle Brawlers.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.693
ACE: Hmmpphh. You guys are awful quick to trust him.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.162
DAN: Hey, c'mon! What's your problem, man?

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.897
You were there at the end of that battle.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.499
When he took his mask off and said he didn't want to

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.100
fight, he meant it!

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.335
JULIE: Would you take it easy Dan.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.604
Ace is just mad that Mira's focus is on someone

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.173
else, and not him.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.841
DAN: Huh? What are you talking about?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.710
RUNO: Awww. Cute and clueless.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.078
DAN: Huh?

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.281
JULIE: Mira's just excited to see her big bro, okay loverboy?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.516
JULIE: Reeelaaaxxx!

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.317
ACE: Owwwwww! [cough] Are you outta your mind!

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.652

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.920
PERCIVAL: Julie's right. You've got nothing to worry about.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.256

May I have your attention please.

KATO: Could I ask you all to please assemble in the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.864
Operation Room.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.065

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.600
MARUCHO: Wicked! It's ready!

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.835
MIRA: Huh?

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.936

[\u266a]

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.407
MARUCHO: I wanted to show you guys this.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.975
MARUCHO: It's a scan of the phantom data we

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.810
received a few days ago.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.179
DAN: What is it?

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.981
RUNO: Is that thing making music?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.083
MARUCHO: Now look here...

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:07.420
MARUCHO: The one on the right is the data Keith received.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.355
ACE: Woah...Check it out.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.225
SHUN: Both strands are practically identical.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.093
MARUCHO: Actually, I think you're wrong, Shun...Come

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.396
and take a closer look. See?

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:21.434
[\u266a]

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:23.102
DAN: Oh man...

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:28.741
MARUCHO: Yup. Both data strands are exactly the same.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.410
MIRA: No way!

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.011
MIRA: What are the odds that Keith would receive

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.414
the same data as us?

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.482
BARON: Who knows, but that must be the reason why the

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.052
Bakugan I fought in Interspace had the same

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.287
Battle Gear as Helios.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:48.628
[\u266a]

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.129
HELIOS: [mighty roar]

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.699
BARON: If that data is how you built the Battle Gear,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.168
then does that mean we can rig some sick machinery

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.769
for Nemus too?

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.738
HELIOS: If anyone should get the next set of Battle

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.406
Gear it's Drago.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.808
DRAGO: What? Why me?

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.942
KEITH: It's true.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.944
With his current stage of evolution we could analyze

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:09.148
Drago's DNA code and splice it with the phantom data.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.384
KEITH: From that we could build a customized set of

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.419
Battle Gear for Drago.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.520
DAN: I'm not sure.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.655
DRAGO: Sounds risky.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.123
JULIE: Ahh..No way!

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.926
Think about how powerful you'd be Drago.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.394
DAN: That's a good point...You'd be

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.563
unstoppable with some Battle Gear.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.064
DRAGO: But I thought...

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.366
DAN: Huh?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.934
DRAGO: ...I already was unstoppable.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.936
DAN: Huh? !

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.439
I guess you did destroy...the BT System on

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.843
your own...and you beat Helios.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:41.681
DAN: Now that you've evolved into Helix

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.618
Dragonoid, maybe you don't need the Battle Gear.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:49.055
SHUN: Dan...Drago is satisfied, don't force him.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.090
DRAGO: I feel good the way I am.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.460
HELIOS: Don't deny yourself this improvement, Drago.

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.829
KEITH: We need to consider the possibility that we're

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.565
not the only ones with the phantom data.

dimension like a scurrying rodent.

MYLENE: Sir...

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:56.389
PRINCE HYDRON: It's Professor Clay's fault!

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:59.926
He and his Mechanical Bakugan are the useless ones.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.261
ZENOHELD: Clay huh?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.698
Someone bring him to me right now!

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.369
PROFESSOR CLAY: I knew it.

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.072
PROFESSOR CLAY: I should have analyzed this sooner.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.474
It was a mistake to focus everything on the

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.242
Mechanical Bakugan Strategy.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.443
PROFESSOR CLAY: Hopefully, I'm not too late to

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.011
salvage this...

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.047
PROFESSOR CLAY: ...and bring King Zenoheld a victory.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.750
PROFESSOR CLAY: Spectra may have had a head start

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.184
on this but no matter...

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.454
PROFESSOR CLAY: His gift is for fighting, not science.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.790
So he's at a disadvantage.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.291
PROFESSOR CLAY: I will harness the power of this

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:36.662
mysterious data and take it to a level that no one else can.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:40.800
PROFESSOR CLAY: What is this?

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.870
It looks as though there is a map embedded here...

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:44.904
PROFESSOR CLAY: ...and it leads back to the

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.572
dimension where the transmission containing

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:48.641
the data originated from.

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.610

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.979
PROFESSOR CLAY: What an interesting...new

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.148
development this is.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.482
PROFESSOR CLAY: Let's see who has the head start

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:57.683
now, my son.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:59.552
Let's see!

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:05.091
DAN: Do you really think the Vexos have the same data?

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.959
KEITH: I offered to share it with Professor Clay and

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.261
he wasn't interested.

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.997
That suggests to me that he probably already has it.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.498
DAN: If they have the same technology then we've got

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.100
no choice.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.669
We have to upgrade to Battle Gear.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:18.271
DAN: If we wanna win then we have to level the

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.473
playing field.

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:25.478
DAN: But...how do you feel about a mechanical body, Drago?

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.679
DRAGO: Not good.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.581
WILLDA: It's against our nature.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.083
NEMUS: We've fought so hard to prove we're sentient beings.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.052
PERCIVAL: What you're asking, is the first step

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:36.522
toward turning us into mindless robot drones.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.491
KEITH: The Battle Gear we'd be creating would be

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.793
utilizing your DNA code.

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:44.030
It would be organic to your body, not foreign.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.866
It would be a totally natural enhancement.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.701
INGRAM: You're saying it would be like constructing

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:51.204
armour from our own flesh and bone?

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.772
DRAGO: As long as you can assure me that it's

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.208
nothing like what the Vexos did with Mechanical

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.277
Bakugan or how you altered Helios when you tried to

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.413
make him the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.547
DAN: Drago...

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.015
MARUCHO: Be sure.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.627
DRAGO: Okay. I'll do it for the benefit of the group.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.695
DAN: Right on!

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:18.231
MARUCHO: You're the best!

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.266
BARON: Drago's a total rockstar!

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.601
PREYAS: Whoa!

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.669
ELFIN: Oh, you're so brave!

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.104
DRAGO: C'mon. Let's go.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.239
DAN: You bet!

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.776
KEITH: Drago's evolution is so advanced it's going

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.013
to take some time to fully analyze his DNA.

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.716
KEITH: For now we can create a hybrid prototype

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.951
by splicing a portion of his DNA strand with

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.386
Helios' Battle Gear.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.988
KEITH: It won't be as precise as the final version,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.490
but it will give us a sense of the possibilities.

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.960
HELIOS: Try not to scratch my Battle Gear, okay?

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.429
DRAGO: I'll do my best.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.365
KEITH: Here we go.

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:58.304
[beeping]

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.439
[\u266a]

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.642
DAN: Whoa!

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.914
ALL: [ooooh ahhh]

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.149
KEITH: Well this version is just a mock up of course...

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.851
KEITH: ...based on the system's initial analysis

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.619
of Drago's DNA...

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.987
KEITH: ...and its compatibility with Helios'

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.289
Battle Gear.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.057
MARUCHO: So depending on the results of the

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.859
analysis, the final version could be quite

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.193
different from this?

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.129
MARUCHO: I can't wait to see it.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.797
The suspense is killing me.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.098
This is worse than waiting to open your presents on

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.034
Christmas morning.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.835
MIRA: Would it help if we put Drago in Bakugan

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.470
Interspace and then scanned and collected his

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:33.706
battle data results from there?

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.008
DAN: Huh? Good idea.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.477
MARUCHO: Why didn't I think of that?

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.451
KEITH: So this is Bakugan Interspace.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.219
DAN: Hah! Look who's still here.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.555
DAN: Good thing we're looking for opponents.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.157
KEITH: [gasp]

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.593
MARUCHO: Keith, meet Subterra Coredem...

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.194
MARUCHO: ...Ventus Hawktor...

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.762
MARUCHO: ...Aquos Akwimos...

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.931
MARUCHO: ...and Haos Aranaut.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.333
KEITH: How do you know their names?

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.301
MARUCHO: In my analysis of the phantom data I found

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.870
their names encrypted deep in the code.

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.139
DAN: We good to go...Drago?

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.341
DRAGO: Yes.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.875
DRAGO: I guess it's now or never.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.744
HELIOS: You sound nervous.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:13.646
BARON: Hey, who's the unlucky one who's gonna go

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.748
toe to toe with Drago?

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.717
Any of you guys brave enough, huh?

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.986
ACE: Yeah, I'm game guys.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.823
JULIE: No way! You guys get to do all the fun stuff.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:26.792
RUNO: Yeah, how bout giving one of us girls a turn?

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:29.729
BARON: Hey,common guys! Take it easy. Let's not fight!

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.964
NEMUS: Yeah! We're all on the same side here.

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.733
INGRAM: There must be a fair way for us to decide.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:34.767
DAN: Hah.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.068

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:40.006
Gear...I'm the one who's going to fight.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.175
KEITH: Except, I'll be fighting as Spectra.

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.243
MIRA: But Keith...!

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.911
DAN: Okay!

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.113
SPECTRA: [chuckle]

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.681
HELIOS: Still up for it? Huh?

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:52.184

[\u266a]

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.823
DAN: Okay, Spectra. Here's to a friendly battle.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:01.327
KEITH/SPECTRA: Could this be the start of a

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.529
beautiful friendship, Dan?

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:07.700
[\u266a]

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.201
JULIE: You can do this, Dan!

RUNO: Go Dan go!

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.272
MIRA: Oh Keith.

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.974
DAN: Remember Drago, we're friends with Keith, but

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.709
we're brawling with Spectra.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:19.278
DAN: So let's give him our 100% okay!

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.747
DRAGO: Of course. No question.

[\u266a]

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.323
KEITH/SPECTRA: Helios...I'd like to see

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.026
what these strange Bakugan can do...why don't you sit

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.594
this one out.

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.638
DAN: Gate Card, set!

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:48.040
DAN: Let's go, Drago. Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.609
DAN: Bakugan stand!

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.711
DAN: Go Pyrus Helix Dragonoid!

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:56.715
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.718

ACE: Whoa! Drago looks more fierce than ever!

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:15.734
MARUCHO: Both those guys have power levels of 900!

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.903
No way...That's totally intense!

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:21.107
PREYAS: That means they're even right from the start!

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.708
KEITH/SPECTRA: Enough!

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.112
DAN: What's that? Running away already?

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:27.913
DRAGO: I don't think he is.

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:30.516
KEITH/SPECTRA: Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:32.752

KEITH/SPECTRA: This simulation is useless

KEITH/SPECTRA: What?

Helix Dragonoid!

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:24.803

hand-to-hand combat mode...

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.541

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.767
GAUNTLET: Ready, Jet Core.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.869
DAN: Battle Gear...Boost!

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:13.946
[\u266a]

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:23.589
[\u266a]

00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:28.027
DRAGO: [pain, exertion]

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.662
DAN: Drago! What's wrong? !

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.997
DRAGO: Don't worry. I'm okay. Keep going.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.166
KEITH/SPECTRA: Now it's our turn.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:40.539
GAUNTLET: Ready, Swayther Rock Hammer.

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:43.642
KEITH/SPECTRA: Battle Gear...Boost!

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:53.719
[\u266a]

00:15:53.719 --> 00:16:03.362
[\u266a]

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.301
DAN: Man! You gave them both Battle Gear?

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.137
KEITH/SPECTRA: You have to stop thinking of this as practice.

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:13.872
Fight like your life depends on it.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.608
KEITH/SPECTRA: Use your battle gear to its full potential!

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.811
DRAGO: Alright. I'm ready for it.

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:21.380
[grunt, pain]

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.749
DAN: Drago! Are you sure you're okay? !

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:26.118
DRAGO: Yes...I'm fine.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.386
KEITH/SPECTRA: Let's do this.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.188
KEITH/SPECTRA: Hawktor Coredem...Battle Gear

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.590
ability activate!

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:38.364
DRAGO: [pain, exertion]

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:45.404
DRAGO: [pain, exertion]

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.005
Haaaaaahhhhhh!

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.607
ACE: Whoa! Nice one!

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.275
RUNO: Give it to 'em , Drago!

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.779
DAN: Yeah dude! Way to go!

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.414
DRAGO: [pain, exertion]

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.216
DRAGO: I don't understand...none of my

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.251
evolutions hurt like this.

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:02.020
[gasp]

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.323
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.326
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.994
DAN: No! Drago!

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:11.430
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.599
DAN: Ouch. You okay? !

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.134
[gasp] Oh no!

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:19.204
DRAGO: [grunt, pain] It feels like I'm being ripped apart!

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:21.340
KEITH/SPECTRA: His body seems to be rejecting the

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.875
Battle Gear.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.710
MARUCHO: Then we need to get it off of him.

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:27.079
It's way too dangerous to continue.

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.580
DAN: Uh...okay.

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.016
DAN: Pull the plug! Drago!

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.218
DRAGO: No! Not yet!

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:35.421
DRAGO: We can't give up. Zenoheld and the

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:38.424
Vexos might return.

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:39.725
DAN: But Drago!

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:42.327
DRAGO: I mean it, Dan. I won't quit!

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.397
DRAGO: I can do this! Trust me.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.899
DAN: Drago...

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:50.069
KEITH/SEPCTRA: Hmmmph...His commitment...is impressive.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:52.137
Well done, Drago.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.672
HELIOS: Spectra...

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.874
HELIOS: If Drago says he can keep going...

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.443
KEITH/SPECTRA: We should let him.

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.946
KEITH/SPECTRA: Let's go...Hawktor! Coredem!

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:05.317
[\u266a]

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.952
DAN: Hey, what the...?!

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.187
MARUCHO: Ahhhhhh! Ahhhh!

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.623
DAN: Stop it Spectra! You're not helping Drago!

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.193
KEITH/SPECTRA: Just listen to me closely, Dan.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.962
We need to push Drago to his potential.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.332
HELIOS: Don't give in, Drago. Don't let it destroy you.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.234
DAN: What? ! [gasp]

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:31.343
DRAGO: I've got this, Dan. Let's finish this...Spectra!

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:35.347
DAN: Drago...Okay, I'll back your play...Battle

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.350
Gear Ability, Activate!

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.519
DAN: Jetkor!

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.621
KEITH/SPECTRA: No way! He did it!

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:47.059
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:53.866
[\u266a]

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:58.437
KEITH/SPECTRA: [gasp] He froze them and blocked their movement.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.906
DRAGO: [grunt, pain into mighty roar]

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.876
DAN: Hold on Drago! Win thiiiiiiiissss!

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:09.281
DRAGO: That's what I plan to do...Haaaaaah!

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:17.789
[\u266a]

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:18.891
BARON: Yeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh!

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:20.058
MIRA/MARUCHO: [cheer]

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.527
JULIE: Great Brawling, Drago!

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.363
DAN: Drago! Huh?

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.334
MARUCHO: Look there! It happened again!

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.910
DRAGO: [panting, exertion, grunt]

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:41.313
DAN: We did it, buddy. Nice job...

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.482
Oh no!

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.450
DAN: Drago...

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:48.320
PERCIVAL: It took everything he had.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.621
KEITH/SPECTRA: Luckily, we managed to collect enough

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:51.290
of his battle data.

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:52.791
KEITH/SPECTRA: We can use it to develop a custom set

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.360
of Battle Gear that won't damage his body.

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.995
PREYAS: You want to put more gear on him?

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:01.867
MARUCHO: I'll put a rush on the analysis of Drago's DNA code!

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:05.871
KEITH: Mira...can you go help Marucho with that?

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:07.706
MIRA: Ah ha.

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:10.042
SHUN: Let's just hope the Vexos don't hit us before Keith

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.010
is done.

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.746
MIRA: Hmmmm. - Father.

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:20.852
PROFESSOR CLAY: [evil scientist laughter] I did it!

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:24.022
PROFESSOR CLAY: I found the \"Alternative\"!

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.525
PROFESSOR CLAY: Your Majesty!

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.561
ZENOHELD: What do you mean \"alternative\"?

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.463
PROFESSOR CLAY: I came upon it as I was analyzing

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.965
the unknown data.

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:35.634
It is the ultimate weapon for the Battle Gear -

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.469
PROFESSOR CLAY: If we can produce this 'Alternative'

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.504
lethal weapon system then it means...

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:40.839
PROFESSOR CLAY: ...we are assured control of all

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.741
dimensional worlds.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.613
ZENOHELD: The ultimate weapon for battle gear...

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:50.582
Hmph, interesting...

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.651
ZENOHELD: Carry on, Professor...And make this

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:56.021
weapon a reality so that we may conquer all worlds.

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:59.124
PROFESSOR CLAY: Yes sir. Thank you, sir.

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.126
PROFESSOR CLAY: [laughter]

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.729
I have you now...Keith!

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.167
VOLT: This \"Alternative\" weapons system that

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.869
Professor Clay is developing will possess

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:13.672
the power to annihilate all mankind.

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:17.376
I thought the BT System was bad, but this is pure evil.

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:18.744
VOLT: Being around the palace while he worked on

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:21.079
it was too much so I went home for a visit.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.149
The town had completely changed...or maybe it's just me.

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.517
I feel like I have lost something precious and

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.085
need to get it back.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.187
But for whatever reason, my Vexos past seems to

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:30.856
keep getting in the way.

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:32.257
VOLT: Maybe you should tune.

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.493
VOLT: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.361
VOLT: What do you think Boriates?
