he and Mira were gone.

GUS: Unfortunately, Hydron sealed his fate along with

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.316
the fate of King Zenoheld.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.651

and...father gone...we are all...finally safe from

harms way and can move on.

to Vestal.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.313
first met...

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.082
MIRA: ...but now...you're just like family to

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:13.318
me...Thank-you, Dan.

ELFIN: Oh yeah! A hundred percent.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.174
I could do a back flip. Wanna see?

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.658
trouble, okay?

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:56.361
I won't be around to watch your back all the time.

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:58.864
KEITH/SPECTRA: But if you ever need anything...don't

DAN: I can't believe you were able to completely

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.097
repair this in only three weeks, Marucho.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.165
You ready to take it for a spin?

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:10.168
MARUCHO: Yup. And I'm going to choose Aquos Akwimos to

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.271
help me out with that.

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:13.939

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.790
REN: Would you be the Bakugan Battle Brawlers?

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:35.427
DAN: Huh?
