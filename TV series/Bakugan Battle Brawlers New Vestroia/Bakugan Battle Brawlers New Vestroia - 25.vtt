00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.908
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.611
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.814
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.350
Time to get...serious!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.954
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.823
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.993
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:28.962
[battle squawk]

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.363
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.732
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:45.311

[\u266a]

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.740
At first you were condemning me...for using

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:18.077
Mechanical Bakugan...But now I see you have joined

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.479
the brawl.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:24.117
Finally, a worthy opponent... Drago!

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.519
Worthier than you...Helios!

[\u266a]

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.381
Haven't you humans ever heard of knocking?

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.886
I would have expected better manners, especially

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.255
from Professor Clay's daughter.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.257
Now get out...

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.060
...before I decide to punish you for trespassing

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.695
on my collection.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:09.762
[angry gasp]

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.164
On your collection?

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.732
That's right...

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.869
These five warrior Bakugan are one of a kind.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.238
And I only need one more to complete the set.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.573
[\u266a]

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.442
But you fools...keep interfering in my

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:27.447
plans...You won't stop me from taking the dragonoid!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.516
You're a monster.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.817
What's that?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.987
You took Preyas, the best friend I ever had...and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.155
you treated him like a thing.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.757
Even worse than a thing.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.025
That's right.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.860
And I'm...

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.062
going to make you pay for that!

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.597
Marucho!

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.833
[angry attack roar]

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.535
Nice tantrum.

[\u266a]

No one attacks a Vestal prince of the realm.

[angry frustration]

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.148
I don't need help.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.750
Come with me, your highness.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.318
What did you say?

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.720
You can't tell me what to do!

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.222
Come back here, coward!

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.524
I'll have you arrested...Stop! Please!

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.192
Calm down. This is for your own good.. Hmmph!

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.862
[yelling]

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.469
Those two deserve each other!

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:25.138
Don't even think about them.

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.441
Time has come...to free our friends, the Bakugan!

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.814
That's right...this is what we've been fighting for.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.049
It's all worth it.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.920
I demand an explanation...

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:45.458
Mylene...You had the Resistance cold but you retreated.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.628
Spectra never would have done something like that.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.864
Prince Hydron...

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.834
We are all leaving New Vestroia immediately.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.402
What are you talking about?

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.972
You need to face facts...Our occupation of

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:02.475
New Vestroia is a failure...So now...we

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.878
shall return home to Vestal and regroup.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.513
What do you mean?

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.616
I'm going to return to my father with my tail

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.184
between my legs?

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.819
I won't go!

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.220
We both know my father will blame me for

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.956
everything that happened here.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.491
It's not fair.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.126
You guys should have stopped the Resistance

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.062
from destroying the Dimension Controllers!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.297
Don't worry.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.898
Your father won't blame you.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.033
He won't?

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.801
No. He'll understand when you explain...that you

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.138
discovered a traitor...Here, in the Vexos.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.040
A traitor named Spectra.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.341
Blame Spectra?

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.576
Of course.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.911
That's why you planted Lync as a spy.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.880
You knew Spectra was planning to overthrow the

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:44.884
royal family and claim the throne.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.886
...But...Spectra...

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.955
Just remember this, my prince...

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.824
You single-handedly uncovered a plot which

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:56.896
would have destroyed the Vestal empire...Imagine...

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.465
...how proud your father will be...when he finds

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.067
out all of this.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.841
Under the orders of his majesty Prince Hydron we

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.878
will be retreating from New Vestroia immediately.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.947
No way...I thought we were leaving his royal lameness

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.115
behind.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.285
Me too...It's not like he can do anything.

00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:21.354
Are you loyal to anything?

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.323
Sure I am, Volt...You know from brawling with me that

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:25.591
I'm very loyal to...

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.660

A Vestal prince might be of some use...But he'll

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.004
also make a terrific...

Dan and Drago are charging this brawl full on...

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.432
But even with the Ultimate Bakugan they'll have to

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.467
work to stay in the game...

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.337
cause the future of New Vestroia is in their hands.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.040
Ha ha! Not bad, eh?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.709

Dan! How's it going, man?

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.538
This is dangerous.

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:55.308
The more we brawl, the more power we're generating.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.477
And I'm not sure we can control it!

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.678
Who cares!

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:01.280
I'll rip apart the whole planet if that is what I

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.882
have to do!

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.584
You're mad!

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:06.686
That's why we will always win!

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:10.590
Why waste time worrying when victory is within our grasp?

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:13.359
With unlimited power the universe is ours!

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.462
Wake up...That thinking's dangerous!

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:19.198
It's essential...Your hesitation will cost you

power, they fight for peace!

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:32.345
Thinking like that will destroy the world.

Wait!

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.366

I don't believe it.

That huge Bakugan can fly?

I can see my house from here!

If they want an air fight...then they'll get

one...Helios!

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:47.853
Will we be able to free Preyas and the others?

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.355
We'll see...

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.760
Nice job.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:57.730
Yeah but...do you have any idea how to work this thing?

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.832
I think we have to activate the biological

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.034
maintenance system to reverse the process that

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.837
turned the Bakugan into bronze statues.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.106
Then what are we waiting for?

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.208
Let's boot this baby up!

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.977
It's not so simple.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.379
We have to figure out the right combination of keys

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.247
to launch the program.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.583
There are a lot...of keys.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.784
Oh Boy!

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.987
Look at all that data.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.223
The combinations are endless.

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:26.158
You gotta be kidding.

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:31.497
We'll never be able to figure this out...

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.099
It's impossible

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.203
What was that?

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:40.506
I thought...I finally found you, Preyas...and

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.575
now you're gone.

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:46.112
I'm sorry I was too late.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.413
That's it!

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:50.149
I can't stand to see you cry, Marucho!

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.984
You're gonna short out the console.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:53.319
What are you doing?

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.653
What does it look like?

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.523
I'm trying every combination of numbers on this board.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:01.293
So if you want to see Preyas, help me push buttons!

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.063
Thank you, Elfin...You're gonna get me crying

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:07.633
again...Make room, I'm getting in there.

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:10.169
That's it. Make your fingers fly!

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.505
We've got nothing to lose.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.509
Come on, everybody!

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.843
We can do this!

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:28.888
Skyress...Preyas...Hydra... Tigrerra.... and Gorem.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.189
Hang on, you guys.

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.323
We're coming.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.392
Faster, everybody!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.295
I don't care how long it takes, Preyas...I'm gonna

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.164
set you free!

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.470
[\u266a]

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:46.405
We're coming Preyas! Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.575
[\u266a]

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:52.311
You can fly but you can't hide, Spectra!

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:57.450
[\u266a]

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.585
Careful Dan, they're around here somewhere.

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:02.421
Looks like we scared Spectra off...that's sweet.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.458
Got 'em.

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.460
Troll patrol. Twelve o'clock high.

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.528
Ability Activate!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.330
Darkus Slave!

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:13.265
Hang on!

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:18.571
[defiant pain]

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.372
Drago!

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.608
[\u266a]

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.810
It seems you have greater mobility...

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:27.813
...But you can't match Helios' firepower.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:31.317
Get over yourself...Double Ability Activate!

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.486
Aquos Cyclo-Wave...plus...

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.054
Ability Card Set.

Haos Frain!

[\u266a]

[pain]

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.101
Epic Hit!

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.703
But was it enough?

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:54.340
Are you kidding? They're totally wiped!

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.641
Think again, human!

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.543
Double Ability Activate!

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:58.978

Darkus Beagalita!

[battle roar]

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:08.754
Let's see you joke your way out of this!

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:11.624
...That's trouble.

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.392
It's a Gravity Space Ball.

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.661
If we get sucked inside we'll be crushed!

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.031
So not happening.

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.833
Double Ability Activate!

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.301

Pyrus Volting plus Maximum Dragon!

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.974
Check your range, Drago.

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:31.177
We only get one shot...Looking good!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.945
Now!

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:38.050
[\u266a]

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.785
Solid!

[\u266a]

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.289
Hang tight!

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.491
Things are about to heat up!

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:47.726
Gotcha!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.329
Woot! Flame on!

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:51.797
I'll cool you down!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.299
Ability Card Set.

You will bow before me!

[extreme battle roar]

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.515
[extreme struggle]

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.317
You can't resist our power!

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.519
You want power? You got it!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:18.290
[extreme effort]

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.025
Pulverize him, Helios!

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.360
Don't give in!

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:23.495
[extreme struggle]

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.235
I know this is a great aerobic workout and all but...

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:31.537
...Maybe hitting random buttons isn't the best way

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.239
to do this.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.040
We can't give up now.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.009
Who's giving up?

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.779
Mira, we can do this.

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.748
Huh? Right.

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:45.684
We're catching pieces of it.

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.853
But we need the whole code to free them...

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.190
What if we can't do it?

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.959
Marucho, why are you stopping?

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:56.862
Oh no!

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:57.863
Drago!

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.031
Look out!

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.000
They're heading for the palace!

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:08.140
[\u266a]

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.009
Whoa!

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.710
Let me off this ride!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.149
I don't believe it!

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.751
The combination!

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.085
You found it!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.758
I'm so brilliant!

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.126
Yes, you are!

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.228
Victory! Well done!

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.030
Finally, a lucky break!

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:33.532
You'll be back to normal soon, Preyas.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.901
[\u266a]

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.870
.. We're inside Vespalace...

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:39.171
Are you all right, Dan?

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:41.206
[weary groan]

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.842
Sure am...It was kind of like a roller coaster.

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.277
You wanna do it again?

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:46.979
You're unbelievable.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.647
[amused laugh]

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:54.453
Something tells me this brawl's not over.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.522
Incoming!

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.857
[threatening roar]

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:02.695
I'm going to annihilate you!

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:04.530
Unleash me Spectra.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.031
Don't hold back.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.667
I won't...It's time to hit them with everything

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.169
we've got.

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:14.073

Ultimate Striker!

All six attributes?

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.149
I didn't know that was possible without the

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.652
Perfect Core.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:28.487
It shouldn't be.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.656
You leave me no choice, Helios.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.658
I'm ending this now!

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.226
Dan!

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.961
Right! We're bringing it now!

Ultimate Gardiner!

[gathering power roar]

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.809
You're king of the ring, Drago!

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.014
[ready for final battle roar]

00:16:56.048 --> 00:17:00.018
[building power/rage roar]

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:04.590
Whoa man...That Helios has serious mood swings.

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.260
Hmm.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.828
Spectra's come to us.

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.398
That saves me the trouble of luring him into our trap.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.732
Hah!

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:16.535
At least Spectra's putting on a good show for his old friends.

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.703
He sure goes big.

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:20.973
I like him. He brawls with style.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:22.374
Who asked you?

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:27.780
What can I say? I'm a Bakugan. I love a good brawl.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.081
He's right Mylene.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:31.250
Let us join the battle. We can still win.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.551
Oh really?

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:34.486
In that case...

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.754
...Get lost.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:36.789
What?

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.090
Hey!

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.458
Hey, what'd I ever do to you?

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.659
Not so tight.

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:41.794
Aaaahh!

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.433
Brontes?

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.234
What's wrong with you, Mylene?

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.636
We have no use for them.

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.271
The Bakugan have served their purpose.

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:53.305
Says who!

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.573
Says me.

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.508
We have created new weapons more powerful than

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:57.910
the Bakugan.

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.712
Professor Clay's Mechanical Bakugan.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.782
A weapon with feelings is useless to us...All that

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:06.685
matters is power...Now that we have that the

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.187
Bakugan are history.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.255
Don't you agree, Volt?

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.125
We agree, don't we Lync?

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.159
Sure.

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:16.361
Prepare the shuttle for lift-off.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.964
Takeoff Sequence Activated.

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.265
All sections secure.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.601
Ignite engines.

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:26.171
[\u266a]

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.573
Unlock docking clamps.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.708
Ready for lift-off.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.378
Now! Lift off!

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:48.393
[intensifying growl]

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:51.063
[annoyed grunt]

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:55.100
[intensifying growl]

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.338
These energy levels are out of control...It's too

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.806
dangerous!

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.174
Dial it down, Drago!

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.442
I can't, Dan!

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:04.443
Why?

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:06.912
This is the only way to save New Vestroia.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.947
We can't give up now!

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.682
You know I'm right.

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.751
Drago!

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.953
Okay, kick it up!

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.489
Bah! You may be afraid of the power but I'm not!

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.591
I want more!

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.126
So do I!

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:24.596
Your new body has been engineered for infinite energy!

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.399
And it's time we use it to crush them all!

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:32.938
[\u266a]

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.873
We'll see about that.

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.415
I'm about to make you famous, Spectra.

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.617
Your name will go down in Vestal history as the

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:49.021
greatest traitor of all time.

00:19:49.054 --> 00:19:51.924
But you won't be around to see it.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.592
[closed-mouth, self-satisfied chuckle)

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:57.629
[battle roar]

00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:01.266
This will hurt you more than it hurts me....

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.303
Sayonara Spectra!

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.805
[explosions]

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:10.208
Whoa!

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.447
Auto Self-Destruct System activated.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.282
Please evacuate immediately.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.584
We can't leave.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.152
The conversion isn't done!

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.553
What's taking so long?

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.388
We have to get the brawlers out of here.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.790
We're not leaving.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.124
Yeah, but.....

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.626
Not without Skyress...

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.465
I hope they've gotten out of there.

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.500
It's bad news if they haven't.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.805
Are you okay, Dan?

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.307
I think so...What just happened?

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.744
Looks like Spectra's friends have turned against him.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.413
Drago!!!!!

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.515
[angry roar]

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.351
They'll come crawling back, once I've destroyed

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:54.019
you once and for all!

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.921
Spectra!

00:20:55.954 --> 00:21:03.762
[crazed laugh]

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.069
Whoa! Our Bakugan pals are still statues, Vesplace is

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.273
crumbling and Spectra and Helios just keep on coming!

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:17.743
But Spectra's gonna have to face me one on one.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.078
Question is; has he got the guts?

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.447
No matter what happens, I still have a few Ability

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:23.682
Cards up my sleeve.

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:26.385
But after a brawl this massive will there be a

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:28.754
New Vestroia left to save?

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.591
Don't miss the battle of the century, next time!

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.626
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.794
Oh yeah.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:46.938
[\u266a]

00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:56.581
