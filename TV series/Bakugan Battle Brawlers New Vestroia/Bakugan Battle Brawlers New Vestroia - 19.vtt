00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.975
DAN: When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.678
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.314
and I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.082
Time to get...

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.350
serious!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:21.121
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance!

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.790
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos,

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:27.293
take back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.062
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.497
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.232
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.304
\u266a What are you going to do? \u266a

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.474
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.510
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.744
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.613
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:47.981
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.716
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.117
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.219
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:57.023
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.859
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.762
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.130
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.067
Drago!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.902
[intense running breathing]

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.478
[intense pain]

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:24.984
Drago!

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.286
Drago, speak to me.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.221
Are you alright, pal?

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.660
DRAGO: Yes, Dan, I'm alright...

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.694
thanks to you.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.868
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Family Ties\".

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:48.041
DRAGO: Ancient Pyrus Warrior Apollonir, I am in your debt.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.143
If you hadn't come back to save me

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.278
I may have been lost forever...

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:55.014
For that I thank you.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.950
You are most welcome.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.385
But I didn't return to save you, Drago.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.888
I came to take you back.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:02.889
What?

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:06.059
You are part of the Perfect Core, Drago.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.462
So when you left New Vestroia's balance of power

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.097
was disrupted.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.602
Even now the Dimension Controller's power increases.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.539
Our world is on the brink of falling to the Vexos...

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.274
or worse.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.675
Are you kidding me?

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.177
We busted our backs to destroy

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.980
the Alpha Dimension Controller for nothing? !

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.982
So we're starting all over.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.484
WILDA: Drago, you can't stay here.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.154
NEMUS: We must find a way back, quickly!

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.489
Agreed.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.758
JULIE: And this time we're coming with you!

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.792
RUNO: That's right!

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.761
You're not ditching us here on Earth again!

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:42.862
Got it?

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.998
DRAGO: I... I... That's up to Dan!

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.432
RUNO AND JULIE: Mmmmm?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.067
DAN: Of course you're coming!

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.170
We can't possibly lose with all of us on the team, right?

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.505
Not so fast, Dan...

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.474
This isn't a field trip.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.942
I know that Drago...

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.278
But we need all the help we can get, you know?

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.547
MIRA: Wait!

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.781
What about Spectra?

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.217
We've got to do something about him?

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.819
We can't just let him run wild here on Earth.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.221
Man, she's right.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.123
DRAGO: That's what I was trying to tell you.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.125
RUNO: I guess it is kinda dangerous.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.327
Who knows what Spectra might do if we go.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.262
JULIE: The farther away we can get from that creep,

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.530
the better.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:18.731
I agree...

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.934
it would be weird bringing him back with us.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.669
What will we do with him then?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.103
NEMUS: Baron...

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:27.273
Perhaps we should think more strategically.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.842
If we leave Spectra and his allies here, we will

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.346
only have three Vexos to defeat in New Vestroia:

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.149
Mylene, Volt and Shadow Prove.

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.384
This may be our best chance to win.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.653
Then we can deal with Spectra.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.021
DRAGO: Sound judgment.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.156
DAN: Okay!

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.458
We got a plan so let's get moving!

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.893
Hit it, Apollonir!

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:47.994
APOLLONIR: Very well...

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.596
I will open the gate.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.297
MIRA: Hold on!

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.299
DAN: Come on! What is it this time?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.867
We coulda been there by now!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.069
Sorry, Dan...

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:00.039
It's just you really should ask your parents....

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.241
My Dad doesn't care but your parents...

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:04.410
You know they worry about you.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.545
RUNO: Dan...

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.980
Maybe Mira's right...

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.482
Your mom doesn't say it but...

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.217
It was really hard for her the last time you took off

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.518
to New Vestroia...

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.920
Same with my parents.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.756
Runo's father freaks out when she's late for a shift.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.324
This is way worse.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:21.894
TATSUO: Who's going to wash the dishes?!

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.696
He is kinda dramatic...

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.066
But he knows that this is important so he should be okay.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.401
Then it's settled.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.436
We'll say our goodbyes to your families then meet up

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.138
here again in the morning.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.607
Apollonir can take us back to New Vestroia.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.843
Don't you think it's dangerous to meet back here?

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.244
Spectra knows this place.

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:40.013
He could come back.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.114
DRAGO: Good point.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:44.550
We can't let Spectra find out what we're up to.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.986
JULIE: Why don't we meet at Batoru Tower?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.254
MIRA: Where's that?

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.455
JULIE: Right there!

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.990
It's easy to find.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.961
Okay, Julie...

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.362
Sounds good to me.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.532
We should get here early, before it opens up for the day...

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.535
That way no one will be around to see us leave.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.003
DAN: That's good thinking, Runo.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.004
APOLLONIR: Fine.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.906
Then I will wait for you there.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.445
GUIDE: The first Batoru Tower was completely

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.915
destroyed in a battle with scary monsters known as Bakugan.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.151
GUIDE: But city engineers rebuilt it.

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:21.421
Now who wants to see the Museum of Used Sneakers?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.558
APOLLONIR: It is a good plan.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.729
But I don't think we've heard the last of Spectra.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:39.806
[music]

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:45.611
[music]

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.947
BOY: Mama!

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.550
SPECTRA: Losing the battle changes my plans.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.819
SPECTRA: Things will be more difficult now that

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:56.856
Drago has returned to Dan Kuso.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.258
SPECTRA: But we don't need him anymore.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.594
That battle with Apollonir allowed me to record

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:06.566
all of Drago's data in my gauntlet.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.402
SPECTRA: However, I can't do anything with it here.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:12.071
GUS: Then I guess we'll have to find a way back

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.240
to New Vestroia.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.042
SPECTRA: I have an idea.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:17.610
GUS: I won't be sorry to go.

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:18.845
I want out.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.680
I really do hate this place.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.448
SPECTRA: Leave it to me.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.951
GUS: What about that weasel, Lync?

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.986
SPECTRA: I'm tempted to leave him stranded

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:30.056
on this planet, but he may still be useful to us.

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.691
GUS: He's Prince Hydron's spy.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.060
Maybe we can use that to our advantage.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:35.728
GUS: When we're done with him I'll deal with Lync

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.230
personally.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:41.200
SPECTRA: Don't worry, I have plans for our little traitor.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.369
[evil laugh]

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.474
DR. MICHAEL: Alice, have you seen my trans-warp

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.942
flux engager?

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:51.811
ALICE: It's in your hand, grandfather.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.179
Lync?

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.247
LYNC: Listen up.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.048
I'm getting tired of waiting for you.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.350
DR, MICHAEL: You must be patient.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.684
LYNC: Be patient?

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.052
Are you trying to be funny?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.187
Huh?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.322
LYNC: It's been weeks since this rusty pile

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:04.957
of junk broke down.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.093
When are you going to finish fixing it, Gramps?

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:08.494
DR. MICHAEL: I can't breathe, Lync!

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:09.896
ALICE: Let him go, Lync.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.464
I mean it!

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:12.765
LYNC: Okay!

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.000
ALICE: Grandfather!

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.234
LYNC: [bratty laugh]

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.136
ALICE: Bully!

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.372
ALICE: I've had enough of you!

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.275
If you want to go home so badly why don't you help?

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:25.344
LYNC: In your dreams!

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:27.847
ALICE: How can anyone be so horrible?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.348
DAN: Dinner time!

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.983
BARON: I'm starving!

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.619
MIYOKO: Please be careful in New Vestroia, Dan.

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.087
DAN: I'm always careful.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.355
MIYOKO: I'm serious Dan.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.124
Normally I wouldn't let you run off again.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.760
But it sounds like Drago really needs you.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.795
DRAGO: Thank you, Mrs. Kuso.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.497
MIYOKO: Please take care of my Dan.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.898
DRAGO: Of course.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.400
NEMUS: I look after Baron.

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:49.368
So I might as well watch Dan too.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.436
BARON: Hey!

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.438
I don't need a babysitter, Nemus!

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:53.773
BARON: I am not a kid.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.474
I'm almost thirteen, ya know!

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:56.876
WILDA: If you say so.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:01.280
[amused laughter]

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.949
MIYOKO: Mira.

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.383
Are you okay?

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.985
Why aren't you eating?

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:09.322
MIRA: Oh. Sorry. It's delicious but...

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.090
MIYOKO: You're quiet this evening.

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.625
Anything wrong?

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.094
MIYOKO: Are you worrying about the Bakugan?

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.963
NEMUS: Whoa!

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.231
Careful Baron.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.166
I don't have a life jacket on!

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.169
BARON: Baths are awesome!

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.405
Yeh!

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.875
BARON: But I guess it's back to light beam showers

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.410
for you and me.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.813
DAN: So I've got it all arranged, Alice.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.115
Apollonir can open the gate to New Vestroia

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.684
and take us all back tomorrow.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:39.952
ALICE: Really Dan?

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.087
That's great.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.321
DAN: So I was wondering.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.156
Do you want to come along with us?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.525
ALICE: What? You mean it?

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:46.926
DAN: Oh sure.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.527
You gotta be worried about Hydranoid?

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.629
Right Alice?

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:50.796
ALICE: I am.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.532
I can't stand the thought of him in danger.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.501
But how am I going to get there?

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:56.936
DAN: That's the easy part.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.071
You still have the Transporter Card, don't you?

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.106
So just use that.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.308
ALICE: Oh! Brilliant, Dan!

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.210
Okay, I'll see you in the morning then.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.912
DAN: Okay then we're cool!

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:08.848
Meet us tomorrow morning at six at Batoru Tower.

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.349
See ya there!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.452
BARON: Hey Master Dan, can I keep these pajama things?

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.520
DAN: Yah...

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.821
Go for it Baron.

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.857
They are totally you.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.759
DRAGO: Everyone is prepared to leave.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.327
DAN: Huh?

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:28.100
DAN: Mira?

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.936
DAN: Hey Mira! Who you talking too?

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.706
MIRA: Uh. Runo!

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.341
I was talking to Runo.

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:36.442
DAN: About what?

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.743
MIRA: It's none of your business, Dan!

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.047
Just... leave me alone.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.848
DAN: What's with her?

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.019
MIRA: Brilliant.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.460
MIRA: I had to do this, Wilda.

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:57.229
WILDA: Sometimes we are faced with impossible choices.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:02.034
MIRA: Thanks Wilda. My friend.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:06.572
[soft crying]

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:12.878
WILDA: Don't go away or you'll miss the ride home.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.316
SPECTRA: They can't get rid of me so easily!

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:25.157
SPECTRA: I'd like to send a message to our friend in Russia.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:26.592
GUS: That can be arranged.

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:40.406
[whimpering]

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:42.842
LYNC: How long am I gonna be stuck on this ice cube?

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.947
LYNC: Where did you come from?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.482
LYNC: Spectra!

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.983
SPECTRA: I have a deal for you.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.418
Listen up Lync.

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.587
LYNC: I'm listening.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.288
SPECTRA: Soon Gus and I will be returning

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.157
to New Vestroia.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.892
LYNC: Impossible!

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:03.896
Dr. Do-Nothing still hasn't fixed the Dimension Transporter.

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.132
SPECTRA: We have found another way back

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.601
and are willing to take you with us.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.436
On one condition.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.338
From now on you will work for me, or you can always

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:15.074
wait for the Transporter to be fixed.

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:18.878
By the time you return New Vestroia will be mine.

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.847
And that pathetic prince you're spying for will be gone.

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:23.082
[laughs]

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:26.018
[growls]

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.826
JULIE: Runo, didn't I tell you that your dad...

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.528
...would be okay with your leaving?

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:36.695
RUNO: Okay?

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.597
He cried all through the dinner shift.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:40.032
JULIE: For him that's good.

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.801
JULIE: I know why you can't sleep.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:43.069
RUNO: Why?

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.470
JULIE: Because you've finally got a chance

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:47.039
to show Dan how much you care.

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:51.043
RUNO: Go to sleep.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:53.579
JULIE: I'm right aren't I?

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.652
JULIE: Hey, everybody!

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.986
DAN: Hey girls!

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.254
RUNO: Ready to go?

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:04.090
DAN: Can't wait.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.392
APOLLONIR: If everyone is here,

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.960
we should get started.

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.462
DAN: Wait a minute, Apollonir.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.397
We've got one more. Alice is coming too.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.765
RUNO: What? Alice!

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:13.899
JULIE: Really?

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.267
DR MICHAEL: Please child.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.969
Promise you'll be careful.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.738
ALICE: I promise, Grandfather.

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:20.372
DR. MICHAEL: Tell Lync you're visiting friends

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.441
so he doesn't follow you.

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:24.844
ALICE: I'll miss you, Grandfather.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.981
LYNC: Hello, Alice.

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:30.416
LYNC: I've been thinking.

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.685
I should apologize for yesterday.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.687
ALICE: It's all right.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.190
LYNC: No it's not.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.226
I just feel so lost.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:41.861
ALICE: Yes. Well then.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:44.530
I'm sorry I lost my temper and slapped you.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.332
LYNC: Apology accepted.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.834
Maybe you knocked some sense into me.

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:54.640
LYNC: I've decided to leave the Vexos.

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.976
I don't believe in what they stand for.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:00.412
LYNC: Alice could you do me a favour?

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.547
ALICE: What do you want?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.715
LYNC: Help me speak to Dan.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.483
I some have information for him.

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:05.618
ALICE: No way.

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.952
This is one of your tricks.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.721
LYNC: I heard there was a time when no one trusted

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.389
you either, Alice.

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:13.292
But where would the Resistance be without your help?

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.261
Now I want to help too.

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.062
ALICE: Really?

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.498
Now I'm not sure what to do.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.700
LYNC: Please Alice.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.969
I've got to talk to Dan right away.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.181
ALICE: Don't cross me...

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:36.348
or else.

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.783
LYNC: Thank you, Alice.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.185
ALICE: Then let's go.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.320
ALICE: Better hang on tight, Lync.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:56.302
ALICE: Are you all in one piece, Lync?

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.469
He's gone.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.038
Lync?

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.274
LYNC: She's such a noob.

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.709
LYNC: She's put her friends in danger

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.477
'cause she's too trusting.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.912
[evil giggle]

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:08.948
SPECTRA: Should I assume your answer is yes?

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.449
LYNC: Ah, great Spectra.

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:11.984
Thanks for the invite.

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:14.453
You're lucky I've decided to take you up on your offer

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.622
but I want rewards.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:17.890
GUS: You Weasel!

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.925
It is an honour for you to serve Master Spectra.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:22.094
Show some respect or I'll teach it to you.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:23.429
DAN: Oh snap!

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:24.730
Where is Alice?

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:26.232
She's supposed to be here.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.000
DRAGO: This is strange for Alice.

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.835
She's usually more dependable.

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.503
APOLLONIR: We shouldn't wait any longer.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.005
I will open the gate.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.640
RUNO: Look! She's here!

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:36.275
JULIE: We almost left without you!

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:38.043
ALICE: [panting]

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.478
DAN: You're late, Alice.

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:40.846
We were waiting for you.

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.081
ALICE: I'm so sorry.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:43.549
I brought Lync along with me

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:45.884
but now he's completely disappeared.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.052
BARON: What?

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.487
I don't believe you did that!

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.189
NEMUS: Lync is a traitor.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:54.593
NEMUS: If he knows we're here, Spectra won't be far behind.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.528
DAN: Have you completely lost it?

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:57.963
Lync is Vexos.

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.898
Vexos can't be trusted.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.166
ALICE: He said he quit.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.835
He said he didn't believe in the Vexos

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:05.971
and had something important to tell you.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:07.006
DRAGO: Dan.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.174
This has got to be a trap.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.745
DAN: Sure it is.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.780
But we can't let that stop us.

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:19.118
APOLLONIR: If we're going to go, we need to go now.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.292
APOLLONIR: Hurry.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:27.826
The Gate won't stay open for long.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.930
DAN: Yah! 'K... Let's roll, guys.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:34.366
GUS: Sorry! You're not going anywhere.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.268
DAN: Gus!

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:41.674
DAN: It's some kind of cage.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.915
DAN: Well, if it isn't the three Vexo-teers.

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.850
DAN: Spectra!

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.118
ALICE: And Lync.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.453
ALICE: You lied to me!

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.422
LYNC: Yeah, what was your first clue, Einstein?

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.756
DAN: Look, dweiner.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.626
You better let us out or else we'll...

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.730
DAN: Mira? You're free?

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.332
MIRA: I'm sorry about this.

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.544
BARON: Mira...

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:19.712
JULIE: How could you?

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.980
RUNO: Please don't...

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.617
DAN: This is wrong.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.088
MIRA: I've no choice.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.290
My place is beside my brother.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.126
SPECTRA: Tomorrow morning at six am.

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:36.195
I hope you will be there, Mira.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:38.764
SPECTRA: I always knew that deep in your heart,

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:42.134
you were really a Vexos my dear sister.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:45.137
MIRA: You know this isn't a joke, Keith.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.839
You're my brother.

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.374
I just want to be with you.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.541
DAN: Hey Mira!

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.510
Who you talking to?

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.345
MIRA: Uh... Just Runo!

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.880
I was talking to Runo.

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:56.215
DAN: No way.

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.716
Spectra is your brother?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.451
DAN: Well even if he is, you know that everything

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.487
he's doing is totally whacked!

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.226
SPECTRA: Come on Mira.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.461
It's time to go.

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:15.300
DAN: Don't do it, Mira!

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:18.237
DAN: Nooooooo!

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.806
DRAGO: Apollonir, keep the gate open!

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.007
APOLLONIR: It's too late.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.843
Once I open the gate it closes automatically.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.779
I have no control over it.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:32.751
DAN: I can't just let them loose in New Vestroia!

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:42.828
[\u266a]

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:49.835
[\u266a]

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.540
DAN: No!

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.108
DAN: I can't believe it.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:57.609
It doesn't make sense.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:00.479
Mira betrayed us!

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:03.649
RUNO: Dan?

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:04.750
DRAGO: Dan.

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:06.151
You have to pull yourself together.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.853
New Vestroia is at stake.

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:11.590
BARON: Master Dan, we gotta go after them.

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:13.192
DAN: You're right Apollonir...

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.793
Hurry! Open the gate!

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:16.595
We've got to leave... right now!

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:17.796
APOLLONIR: I'm sorry.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.264
I can't do that.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.400
APOLLONIR: I used an extreme amount of power

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:25.337
in that battle with Helios, I just don't have enough

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.940
left to open the gate again.

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:31.844
DAN: Now what?

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.145
ALICE: Don't worry.

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.113
There's still another way.

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:49.261
[\u266a]

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.396
ALICE: Lucky for us the Dimensional Transporter

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.099
is almost completely repaired.

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:56.468
ALICE: But we needed to keep that quiet so Lync

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.103
wouldn't find out.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.805
DAN: What are we waiting for?

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.640
Let's do it!

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.677
DR. MICHAEL: Well hello everybody.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:06.678
What's the matter?

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.913
Did you miss your gate?

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:10.482
ALICE: Yes, but there's no time to explain Grandfather.

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.718
Please we have to hurry!

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:15.921
ALICE: We need your help to get back to New Vestroia.

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.690
The Dimensional Transporter is the only way.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.425
DR. MICHAEL: I'm happy to help out.

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.960
But you should know there's a problem

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.795
with the Transporter.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.197
ALICE: What is it?

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.366
DR. MICHAEL: In order to repair the Transporter systems

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.801
I made use of Vestal technology.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.436
It was fascinating.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.405
They're a scientifically advanced society

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:35.874
despite their views on the Bakugan.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:36.975
BARON: Sorry?

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.310
You lost me at hello.

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.746
DR. MICHAEL: I took Lync's gauntlet without him noticing.

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.315
It was worth the risk to get his technology.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.917
DR. MICHAEL: Then I diverted a portion of the

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.785
gauntlet's system and installed it into the

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.320
Dimension Transporter.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.988
DR. MICHAEL: So now the-Transporter is repaired

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:53.091
but it will only work with those who wear a gauntlet.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.327
JULIE: Then that means...

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.596
DAN: That the only ones who can use it will be

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.331
Baron and me, right Doc?

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.934
DR. MICHAEL: I'm sorry to say you're right, Dan.

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:04.369
RUNO: Oh well then I never really wanted to go

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:06.939
to New Vestroia anyway.

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:13.879
JULIE: Runo...

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:16.648
DAN: Well if that's the way it's gotta be.

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:19.084
Sorry you guys are gonna have to sit this one out again.

00:20:19.117 --> 00:20:22.788
DAN: So... Gotta go... Don't forget me.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.456
RUNO: Don't ever come back!

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.594
DAN: I'm sorry you're not coming.

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.662
Don't worry. I'll be back.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:32.864
RUNO: Yeah.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.967
DR. MICHAEL: [busy humming] Yes, I see.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.401
Won't be long now, kids.

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:43.842
DR. MICHAEL: Realigning the targeting controls.

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:50.315
DR. MICHAEL: Then calibrate the stabilizers.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.683
And voila!

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:53.785
We're ready to go!

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.292
DAN: See ya!

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:03.662
DAN: It's just you and me Baron.

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:05.464
BARON: I won't let you down.

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.601
BARON: Master Dan and I aren't exactly

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.504
in for a warm welcome back on New Vestroia.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.640
I mean, not only has Mira betrayed us,

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:18.777
but Marucho, Ace and Shun are totally missing in action.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.112
There's no choice!

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:22.247
It's up to me and Master Dan to destroy

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.816
the Dimension Controllers ourselves.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.451
I hope I don't let him down!

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.920
Don't miss the next heavy weight battle!

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.689
Get psyched!

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.658
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.293
Be there, Brawlers.
