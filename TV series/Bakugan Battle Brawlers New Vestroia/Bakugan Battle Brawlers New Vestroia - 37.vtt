00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.109
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.378
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.080
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.983
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.019
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.588
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.323
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.825
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.228
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.663
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.432
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.533
and the stake are high.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.201

me...Hey, what do ya think Cycloid?

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.784

I'm totally relaxed!

Run out of steam or something?

first introduced to our Bakugan...

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.806
MARUCHO: we thought they and the cards were just

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.707
part of a game.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.109

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.248
DRAGO: We Bakugan were like helpless pawns.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.150
DAN: I'm really sorry, buddy.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.252
That was before we knew you were living beings,

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.587
just like us.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.755
DRAGO: It's not your fault.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.356
MARUCHO: Well, I wanted to see if I could bring back

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.126
the fun elements of the game but in a virtual form.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.196
That way no Bakugan would be harmed...So I secretly

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.298
started this project and have been working on it in

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.766
my spare time.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.267
RUNO: Looks like Billy isn't the only one around

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.802
here who likes surprises.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.904
ACE: I don't see what's so great about surprises.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.239
They're totally overrated.

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.574
BARON: Unless you're talking about surprise

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:55.675
birthday parties.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.944
Especially when there's ice cream and cake!

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.046
MIRA: Okay, let me understand this...Kids

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.215
from all over the world can battle each other in

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:05.685
this Virtual arena anytime they want, just by logging on?

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:08.087
MARUCHO: Yes, that's basically it.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.023
SHUN: Big deal. Sounds like a chat room.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.758
MARUCHO: Nope. This is way cooler.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.727
PREYAS: Would you quit stalling then.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.795
Tell us about.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:19.065
ELFIN: Yes Master Marucho. Tell us, tell us.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.900
MARUCHO: Well, after several months of research

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.568
and lots of trial and error...

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.103
MARUCHO: ...my team of computer engineers and

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.138
technicians have finally figured out a way to

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.008
convert people to data and then import that data into

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.244
the virtual world.

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.311
[\u266a]

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.346

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:34.580
MIRA: Incredible!

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:35.615
ACE: Whoa!

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.850
MARUCHO: Well, that's the theory anyway.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.151
PREYAS: Huh?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.687
ELFIN: What do you mean, theory?

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:43.756
RUNO: So...you mean...

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.191
MIRA: We get to test it out?

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.927
MARUCHO: That's right. If you want to.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.128
MARUCHO: I was going to...

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.130
MARUCHO: ...do it myself first but since you're all here.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.933
ELFIN: I dunno Master Marucho.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.636
It sounds pretty risky. Are you sure?

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.937
PREYAS: Yeah, Elfin's right.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.007
I'm not sure you should make yourself a test guinea pig.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.174
MARUCHO: Don't worry.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.277
My staff have run every safety test.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.413
MARUCHO: But if any of you are still unsure, I understand.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.215
MARUCHO: Bakugan Interspace is a great way

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.450
for us to practice our Brawling, though, while we

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.619
hide out from the Vexos.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:14.987
So what do you say?

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.690
DAN: I say, I'm in. Sign me up.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.358
BARON: Yeah, I'm with Master Dan.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.526
RUNO: Wait for me!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.161
BILLY: Race you there Julie!

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:24.063
JULIE: Okay, I'm right behind you!

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.131

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.332
ACE: Me too!

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.868
MARUCHO: Awesome guys! This is gonna be so much fun!

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.070
DAN: You coming, Shun?

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.905
SHUN: I don't think so. Not this time Dan.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.174
DAN: Come on, Shun. There's no reason to be scared.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:37.443
SHUN: I'm not scared...I have something urgent I

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.711
need to attend to.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.846
MIRA: What are you being so uptight about, Shun?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.716
ACE: Leave him if he doesn't want to come.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.851
MARUCHO: Maybe next time...Let's get this

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:48.888
party started...Commence testing, please.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.891

[\u266a]

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:17.783

[\u266a]

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.160

DAN: You did it!

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.130
RUNO: So this is Bakugan Interspace?

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.133
BARON: This is where we're supposed to battle?

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.769
MARUCHO: No, we wouldn't actually brawl in here.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.637
This is kind of like the waiting room.

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:41.073
MARUCHO: Follow me and I'll show you the arena options.

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:43.209
RUNO: There's more than one choice.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.343
MARUCHO: Absolutely.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.745
MARUCHO: We programmed several environments from

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:49.715
which you can choose where to have your battle.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.217
MARUCHO: Although right now, there's only one

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.452
that's fully functional.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.887

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:11.170
DAN: This is so cool, man!

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:12.605

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.607
attribute energies to the Vexos.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.542

RUNO: How 'bout it Marucho?

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.580
MARUCHO: Huh? Wait.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.983
Hold on...If we all battle at once the system will

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.484
overload and crash!

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.088
MARUCHO: So how 'bout...

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.823
MARUCHO: ...we all draw straws to determine the

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.559
order of the brawls. Okay?

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.797
ALL: Come on...Nuuuuumber one!

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.132

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.267
This stinks!

DAN: ...I should have been number one!

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:45.704

MARUCHO: Okay then.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:57.049
So whoever got number two will be battling Ace.

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.338
What was the point of drawing straws then?

MIRA: Just because you like Ace, doesn't mean you

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.208
can bud in like that.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.277
BILLY: What's that? You mean she likes Ace?

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.012
JULIE: Oh, don't listen to them.

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.281

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:31.217
love birds, alright?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.919
So I'll take both of you on...What d'ya say?

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:34.920
BILLY: Okay!

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:36.055
JULIE: You bet!

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.990
MARUCHO: Okay, guys...I think the system can

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.292
handle a three-way battle for now.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:43.095
