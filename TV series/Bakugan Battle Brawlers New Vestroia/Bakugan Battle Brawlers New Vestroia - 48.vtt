[\u266a]

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.711
PRINCE HYDRON: It seems that Volt's demise at my

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.381
hands didn't convince Lync that betraying my father

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.949
was a bad idea.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.486
So I had to teach him his own lesson.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.787
PRINCE HYDRON: Unfortunately, I was so

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.156
busy reveling in my victory that I didn't

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.492
notice him leaving behind a clue for the Brawlers.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.328
PRINCE HYDRON: Now the Brawlers know about

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.431
Father's latest plan so the pressure is on.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.032
KEITH: It's a lethal weapon that can destroy

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.668
entire galaxies and the lives within.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.808
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.843
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.044
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.846
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.281
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.116
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.484
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.520
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.054
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.065
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.803
ZENOHELD: Lync's betrayal has cost us precious time.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.304
ZENOHELD: We need the Battle Gear data and the

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.706
DNA code in order to finish the Alternative

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.209
weapon system.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.845
ZENOHELD: You must secure this immediately...so that

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.381
I may fulfill my destiny.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.183
MYLENE: I can get the data that you desire, King

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:27.420
Zenoheld...I know where the brawlers are hiding.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.988
ZENOHELD: Do it then.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.659
PRINCE HYDRON: And try not to mess it up...Mylene.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.294
PRINCE HYDRON: Otherwise I'll be forced to deal

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.863
with you, just like I did with Lync and Volt.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:43.803
MYLENE: Your threats don't frighten me, little boy.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.238
MYLENE: Not at all.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.340
MYLENE: I have my own reasons for accepting this mission.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.843
I'm doing this for myself and no one else.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.146
MYLENE: Shadow...

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.081
SHADOW PROVE: Hahaha...looking for a

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:58.918
little back up on your trip. Mylene?

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.086
MYLENE: I guess.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.521
MYLENE: Just try not to get in my way.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.889
SHADOW PROVE: Like I ever do!

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.090
MYLENE: [sigh] Let's go.

SHADOW PROVE: Yeeeeaaaah!

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.512
SHADOW PROVE: So this is where those Brawler geeks

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.115
live then...I think I could handle this.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.985
MYLENE: Huh... something's definitely not right, here.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:36.856
MYLENE: Getting in this place was way too easy.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.525
MYLENE: Just keep your guard up.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.527
You never know. This could be a trap.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.096
SHADOW PROVE: Ahhh. Relax, you're paranoid.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.797
They're probably just out.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.776
SHADOW PROVE: Is it here?

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.078
SHADOW PROVE: Oh, sorry buddy. Wrong room.

SHADOW PROVE: Arrrrrggghhh.

There's still another hundred rooms to go!

SHADOW PROVE: Seriously! Who lives in a place like this?

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.126
How much room does one little runt need?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.561
DAN: Nice dance moves, pal.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.995
SHADOW PROVE: Hey! Mind your own business!

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.031
Uh...Who said that?

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:21.968

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.260
to get your awful \"Alternative\" machine going?

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.739
SHADOW PROVE: Just looks like a big empty room to

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:58.344
me...You better not be messing with us there, pal.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.647
MIRA: He wouldn't do that.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:03.983
MARUCHO: Ready Kato?

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.319
KATO: On your command, Master Marucho.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:10.223
MARUCHO: Okay. Battlefield, activate!

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.626

KEITH: Hmmmph.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.802
MYLENE: Oh.. why you...!

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.540
MYLENE: You'll pay for your trickery, Spectra!

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.009
[\u266a]

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.945
SHADOW PROVE: Traitors don't scare me. Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.149
MYLENE: Whah? Where are we?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.351
SHADOW PROVE: Enough, Spectra!

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.952
You get us out of here...right now!

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.721
Do you hear me? Right Now!

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:44.824
KEITH: I'm sorry but I just can't do that.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.393
KEITH: I have no control from inside this realm.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:48.694
SHADOW PROVE: Say what?

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.229
MYLENE: Then.. is this ...

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.898
MYLENE: ...a virtual reality?

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.366
MARUCHO: That's exactly right.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.534
MYLENE: Huh?

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:55.902
MARUCHO: You're now inside Bakugan Interspace, a

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.904
virtual reality environment created

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.939
specifically for Bakugan battles!

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:01.040
MARUCHO: You're in my world now.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.508
So get ready to brawl!

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:06.412
DAN: I love it! Keith is the master of the fake out.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.547
Ah man, he even had me fooled.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.184
DRAGO: Very impressive, indeed.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.654
MIRA: Listen guys, we don't have to fight.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.757
What if you switched sides and joined us?

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.825
MIRA: You have to realize that Zenoheld's plan is

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.695
crazy and downright evil.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.230
SHADOW PROVE: Just put a sock in it.

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:27.466
We may be stuck in here but I'm not gonna listen to this.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.068
MIRA: But I...

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.403
SHADOW PROVE: No more jibber jabber.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.505
If you say we have to battle then bring it, punks.

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.041
Let's get it on. [laughter]

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.142
MYLENE: And just to make things way

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:39.645
more interesting, why not put a wager on things.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.280
DAN: What'd she say?

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:43.716
MYLENE: Win the battle and we'll leave the Vexos and

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.351
join you.

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.852
SHADOW PROVE: Don't get too excited.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.089
There's no way we're gonna lose.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:54.327
KEITH: Okay then.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.495

Spectra...And now I'm gonna show you...just how much!

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.742

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.965
MYLENE: Do you honestly think you can take me down

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.233
by yourself?

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:17.870
And I thought your brother was the arrogant one!

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.638
MIRA: Ability activate!

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:20.906
GAUNTLET: Ability Card, set.

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.641
MIRA: Earth Seeker!

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:26.245
WILLDA: [rising roar]

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:27.613
WILLDA: Huuuuuaaaaahhhh!

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:35.687
[\u266a]

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.790
WILLDA: Hah!

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:39.591
MIRA: You asked for this.

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:42.294
MYLENE: Whatever...bring it! Big deal!

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.062
MIRA: Ability Activate!

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:46.265
MIRA: Galosh Punch!

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:49.601
WILLDA: Huuuuaaaaah!

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.004
MYLENE: You bore me...Ability Activate!

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:55.174
Saber Barracuda!

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.111
WILLDA: Haaaah!

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.813
HELIOS: This could go either way.

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:02.681
KEITH/SPECTRA: Yes...I know.

00:18:02.714 --> 00:18:04.783
WILLDA: [grunting, exertion]

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.552
DAN: She's gonna win. I can feel it!

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.887
DRAGO: I hope you're right.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:14.059
MIRA: I'm saving the best for last.

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:17.062
Ability activate! Hyper Earth Ball!

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:19.064
WILLDA: You Vexos and your Mechanical Bakugan are a

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.300
plague that has cursed the universe.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.702
It's time you were taken down, for good!

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:27.039
MYLENE: Now Macubass!

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:30.075
WILLDA: Haaaaaaaahh!

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:33.612
MIRA: We can do this Willda!

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:36.915
Let's show them...that good...will always prevail!

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.852
WILLDA: Victory is ours!

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:44.356
MYLENE: I'm sick and tired of your talk Mira!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.292
KEITH/SPECTRA: Helios...

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:49.094
HELIOS: Yes?

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.129
KEITH/SPECTRA: I think Mira just won it.

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:54.867
MYLENE: What the...?!

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:04.943
[\u266a]

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:10.149
[\u266a]

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.483
MYLENE: No!

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:12.718
GAUNTLET: Mylene Life force, zero.

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:13.886
JULIE: Yeah, sister!

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.087
RUNO: Awesome! DAN: Wicked!

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:21.093
WILLDA: Just like I said...In pieces!

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:26.265
MYLENE: How could I have lost? I don't understand.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.133
KEITH/SPECTRA: Mylene...

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.501
KEITH/SPECTRA: You were right.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.136
We used to have the same desires.

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:32.704
We both coveted power...but I learned

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:35.207
something from the Brawlers.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.843
KEITH/SPECTRA: It's that true power...

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.077
KEITH/SPECTRA: ...lies in friendship and

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:45.617
teamwork...And you can be part of that if you want.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:51.823
KEITH/SPECTRA: We are ready to welcome you in.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.226
KEITH/SPECTRA: Isn't that right, Mira?

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.460
MIRA: Yes, Keith.

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.662
MYLENE: Gee, Keith.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.864
What a beautiful and touching speech that was.

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:00.165
KEITH: [gasp] MIRA: [gasp]

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:01.533
MYLENE: Unfortunately...

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:04.336
MYLENE: ...it's made me want to fight you even more!

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.938
KEITH: [gasp]

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:06.972
MYLENE: I failed my mission and I lost

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:10.175
the battle so I have to end this on my terms.

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.311
Maybe that sounds like sour grapes to you but I

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:15.080
can live with that.

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.682
SHADOW PROVE: [laughter]

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.952
Easy does it, tiger. [slurp]

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:22.020
MYLENE: Just back off!

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.422
KEITH: Mylene... NO!

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.225
MYLENE: Good-bye...Spectra!

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.429
MYLENE: Hee yah!

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:35.634
MYLENE: Whoa! What the...?!

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:36.969
SHADOW PROVE: What's happening?

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.203
OPERATOR A: There's been a rupture in the

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.504
Interspace continuum.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:40.706
OPERATOR B: Sensors are showing an internal

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.541
gravitational shift and we're getting errors.

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:43.842
RUNO: Dan, what's wrong?

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.711
MARUCHO: That ball that...Mylene threw.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.813
Somehow it seems to have opened up a dimensional portal

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.348
that's causing Bakugan Interspace to

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.882
shut down on itself.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.451
OPERATOR A: It's no use. We're unable to stabilize

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:53.685
the Interspace.

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:56.221
DAN: Keith! Mira!

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:58.056
SHADOW PROVE: What's going on? What did you do?

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.593
MYLENE: [gasp]

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.562
MIRA: Keith..? !

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.368
PRINCE HYDRON: It seems that no matter how much I

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.104
do for my father, nothing is ever good enough for him?

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.172
What do I have to do to get his approval?

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.841
I've done everything he's asked of me and succeeded

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.242
every time.

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:19.444
It's like he's punishing me for the failure of the others.

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:20.879
PRINCE HYDRON: It actually took a visit from my

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.381
departed Vexos teammates to give me an idea of how

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:23.815
to prove myself.

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.884
I would have to fight my father and take him down.

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.020
If he won't respect me, then I'll have to defeat

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.821
him and take over the throne.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.857
PRINCE HYDRON: Tune in and check it out.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.892
PRINCE HYDRON: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.161
PRINCE HYDRON: Respect...will be mine.

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:47.472
