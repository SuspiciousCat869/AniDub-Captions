WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.175
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.311
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.214
with him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.250
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.352
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.721
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.289
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.092
and transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.261
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.797
into more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.532
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.933
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.201
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.138
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.508
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.778
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.579
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.816
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.184
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.219
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:57.090
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.862
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.130
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.468
ZENOHELD: Ability Activate!

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:11.137
ZENOHELD: Fire Spartan!

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.241
DRAGO: [pained cry]

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.180
DAN: Drago!

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.714
SPECTRA: His Attribute Energy!

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.250
DAN: Dragooooo!

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.724
ZENOHELD: We now have all of the Attribute Energies

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.228
required to fully power the Bakugan Termination System.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.734
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Exodus

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.012
DAN: Whah? What's happening?

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.414
PRINCE HYDRON: I'll tell you what.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.915
PRINCE HYDRON: You see all those fancy flashing

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.417
lights there on the screen?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.586
That means that the Six Attribute Energies have

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.554
all finished charging up.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.822
MARUCHO: Then that means...

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.191
ACE: ...the BT System is fully functional.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.759
LYNC: Bullseye, pal-ee.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.162
SHADOW PROVE: And now all the non-mechanical Bakugan

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.430
are gonna die!

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.965
Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.266
PREYAS: Is that for real?

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.135
ELFIN: Can't we do something to stop it?

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.536
DAN: You better turn that off

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.271
...ya know what's good for you.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.240
LYNC: Look at you... making threats.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.741
[laughter]

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.377
PRINCE HYDRON: You just have to face it Dan, you lost.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.146
PRINCE HYDRON: The BT System is locked and loaded

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.648
and you're powerless to stop it.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.816
DAN: You jerk.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.050
Come here!

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.085
DRAGO: Dan wait!

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:33.887
We don't have time for this!

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.556
We have to get to New Vestroia!

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.591
BARON: But that's where the BT System is.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.426
Shouldn't you be headed the other way?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.662
DRAGO: I can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.265
I have to fight while I'm still alive.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.299
PREYAS: Drago's right.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.767
What've we got to lose?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.835
ELFIN: Yeah!

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.136
Let's get movin'!

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.437
PERCIVAL: You heard them.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.839
Time to go!

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.742
DAN: Looks like we're going on a trip.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:56.910
SPECTRA: Yes... So it seems.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:57.944
Let's go.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.148
PRINCE HYDRON: What?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.449
No goodbye?

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.086
MYLENE: Wait, we're just gonna let them go?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.321
ZENOHELD: Don't worry Mylene.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.757
ZENOHELD: They're going on a fool's errand.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.460
No matter what they do, the Bakugan are history.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.030
ZENOHELD: [sinister laughter]

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.045
DAN: So this is it, huh?

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.446
SHUN: It's impenetrable.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.914
Trust me. I've tried.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.282
I'm sorry, Dan.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.917
DAN: Well, if we can't crack this nut

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.586
then we gotta gather up every single Bakugan

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:40.720
in New Vestroia.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.156
MARUCHO: Every single Bakugan? Impossible.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.357
DAN: You bet!

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.225
We're gonna take them back to Earth with us using

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.928
the Dimension Transport System on Spectra's ship!

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.396
MIRA: Are you serious?

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.432
SPECTRA: I don't remember volunteering my ship...

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.500
for an evacuation.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.603
Still, I suppose it's in my best interest to

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.471
protect all the Bakugan.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.306
BARON: We better hurry up, guys.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.275
BARON: Before we left I synchronized this

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:05.078
with the timer back at the Mother Palace.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.579
ACE: Man!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.581
Looks like we don't have much time.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.916
DAN: Then let's quit talkin'

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.718
and start roundin' up Bakugan.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.224
PREYAS: Calling all Bakugan!

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.792
Listen up everyone!

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:20.960
SWARM OF BAKUGAN: [shocked/surprised]

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.295
ELFIN: This is an emergency evacuation!

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.463
If you stay here you'll die!

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:24.998
SWARM OF BAKUGAN: [shocked/surprised]

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.833
SWARM OF BAKUGAN: [frightened, confused]

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.134
ELFIN: Hurry, everyone!

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.469
Come with us!

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.405
DRAGO: You must stay calm, but move quickly!

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.740
PERCIVAL: You heard them people!

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.174
On the double!

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.745
Let's go!

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.919
ACE: I've never seen Spectra so cooperative.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.522
SHUN: He's creating the ultimate Bakugan.

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.924
But, if the others are dead it won't be so ultimate ...

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.393
Trust me, he's only helping us

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.628
because it suits his sinister agenda.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.664
He's still not to be trusted.

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.565
BARON: Well, whatever his reasons are Shun,

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.668
I still think it's good that he's helping.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.403
Without his ship we'd be toast.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.571
MARUCHO: That's true, but I'm not sure we can...

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.275
DAN: Come on, don't be so negative guys!

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:11.344
DAN: You saw the way he battled along side of us.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.046
He was in it to win it and had our backs

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.614
one hundred percent!

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.420
DAN: He's definitely on our side now!

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.155
MIRA: [unsure, shocked]

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.758
MIRA: So, um, Keith.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.095
Where is Gus right now?

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.431
MIRA: I mean he's usually standing right by your side,

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.532
isn't he?

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.967
SPECTRA: You and I have a score to settle

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.102
for what you did to Gus.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.072
ZENOHELD: Ah yes Gus, your little lap dog...

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.809
Don't worry, he was loyal to his Master Spectra until the end.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.510
SPECTRA: Good help is hard to find

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:46.446
and Gus won't easily be replaced...

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.283
You'll pay for taking him from me.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.618
MIRA: What happened to him?

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.887
SPECTRA: After he lost his battle to Zenoheld,

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.089
Gus disappeared.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.657
Without a trace.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.258
MIRA: [gasp]

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.127
MIRA: Is that why you're helping us, then?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.165
Is it to avenge Gus?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.201
SPECTRA: So tell me Mira, where exactly on Earth

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.069
do you plan on taking all of the Bakugan

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.537
we're transporting?

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.406
DAN: Well...um...

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.941
MARUCHO: We could just take them all

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.676
to my house for now.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.578
DAN: Hey! That's a great idea!

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.780
We could easily fit them into your place Marucho.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.849
Which means we don't have to split them up.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.786
SPECTRA: Very well...Then I will set the coordinates

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.222
for our re-entry to Marucho's house.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.057
Please come with me.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.525
MARUCHO: You got it.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.327
ACE: Wait. I'm coming too.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.896
ACE: Just to make sure you get the coordinates right.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.167
SPECTRA: Very Well, as you like.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:52.378
RUNO: [eating sounds]

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.514
TIGRERRA: Slow down, Runo.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.916
You're going to choke.

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.919
RUNO: I'm just so steamed ...

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.521
those guys left us behind again.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.390
I just can't stand it...How rude.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.958
TIGRERRA: I understand.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.960
But you should still take it easy.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.096
JULIE: Tigrerra's right, Runo.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.697
JULIE: You're gonna chomp your tongue off

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.032
if you're not careful.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.734
RUNO: I can't believe you're not angry too.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:17.336
JULIE: Well, I was but then I started exercising

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.938
and all my anger went away.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.206
You should try it.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.974
One...two!

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:30.049
JULIE: Oh look, a dimension gate just opened up.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.251
RUNO: It must be Dan and the others.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.286
They're back!

We're running out of time!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.175
we can save them all.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.211
DAN: Ah well Mira, we'll just keep going

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.246
until we get as many as we can.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.781
We can't just give up.

If we wait any longer Drago and the others...

Time to split!

DRAGO: Hold on, Dan.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.639
We haven't saved everyone yet!

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.840
DAN: I know buddy.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.508
But we're totally out of time.

ACE: Wasn't he with you?

PERCIVAL: I heard him say...

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.634
PERCIVAL: ...he wasn't going to leave anyone behind.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.935
HELIOS: Hmmmphh.

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.203
Of course he did.

Always playing the hero.

DRAGO: I'm sorry, Dan...But I can't leave

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.048
knowing that others will be left behind.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.349
DAN: Drago, you did your best.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.118
No one's gonna blame you!

MARUCHO: Hey Spectra, can you transport the ones

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.957
that are here for now?

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.492
SPECTRA: All right then.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.500
MARUCHO: Hey thanks a lot.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.168
I'm sure Drago will be right along,

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.370
but better safe than sorry.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.672
ACE: Right.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.374
SPECTRA: Looks like Drago isn't the only one who has

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:39.111
decided to remain behind.

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:41.280
DRAGO: Many have already given their lives in order

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:44.784
to save the Bakugan race from extinction.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.820
DRAGO: The wise and noble Nobilion and Wavern...

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:54.093
DRAGO: ...not to mention the Six Ancient Soldiers.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.996
DRAGO: If I give up now then their sacrifices

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:58.898
will have been in vain.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.433

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.268
SPECTRA: Helios! Get back here now!

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:41.040
HELIOS: Your cheap theatrics are touching,

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.776
but I'm not going to let you martyr yourself.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.078
You and I have a score to settle and I'm not letting

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.447
you get out of it that easily.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.516
DRAGO: Out of my way.

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.585
HELIOS: You come back to Earth with me now,

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:55.855
or we battle it out to the end, right here.

PROFESSOR CLAY: The BT System is moments away

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.602
from activating.

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.370
PROFESSOR CLAY: Thirty seconds before firing,

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:14.106
a dimension wave will be deactivated.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.342
PROFESSOR CLAY: In that very instant, the Bakugan

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.644
will return to their original form...

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.279
PROFESSOR CLAY: ...and the Brawlers will sit by and

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:23.616
watch helplessly as their beloved comrades turn to dust.

Only 30 seconds left!

I don't have time for your nonsense!

HELIOS: What if I help you destroy that thing?

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.825
HELIOS: We'll smash it into a million pieces!

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:06.826
DRAGO: Very well.

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:09.295
We destroy it, I'll fight you.

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:12.398
DRAGO: Make sure you aim at the same spot as me.

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:14.266
HELIOS: You make sure, Drago.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.435
I'm always dead-on.

MIRA: Unbelievable.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.895
Even together, Drago and Helios didn't put a

PROFESSOR CLAY: I don't understand.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.680
How can that possibly be?

Explain yourself immediately!

I am sorry sir, but it seems that something

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:10.469
is absorbing the attribute energies from the BT system

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:12.438

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.254
PRINCE HYDRON: Professor Clay!

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:37.222
LYNC: I'm gonna get those Brawlers!

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:40.459
Just you wait...I'm gonna get 'em!

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.660
MYLENE: I can't believe it.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.495
We had them and we just let them go.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.931
ZENOHELD: It would seem that I underestimated

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.100
our young friends.

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.611
DAN: Drago...

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:02.414
SPECTRA: Helios, are you okay?

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.616
HELIOS: Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.885
SHUN: So then, the BT System...I guess it wasn't

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.521
activated after all you guys.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:11.390
SPECTRA: It would appear that it didn't.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.991
MIRA: Drago did it!

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.028
He stopped the BT System.

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:19.431
DAN: Then why...? If he's fine, why didn't Drago

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.567
come back down yet?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.935
[gasp]

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.270
BARON: Maybe Master Drago had to...

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:29.074
MARUCHO: ...sacrifice himself to save the others.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.243
DAN: Drago...!

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.214
MIRA: Oh Dan...

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.582
ACE: Huh...Guys, look...

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:37.649
look up there!

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.685
DAN: [gasp]

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.924
DAN: Drago... Drago, you're alive!

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.029
DRAGO: Dan!

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.297
DAN: Drago!

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.465
MIRA: Drago!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.466
MARUCHO: It's him!

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.934
BARON: Welcome back!

00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:03.175
[panting]

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:04.409
DAN: [sniffle]

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.978
I thought...

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.579
I thought ...you didn't make it buddy.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.715
DRAGO: I'm sorry I worried you.

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:13.285
DAN: It looks like you've evolved again.

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.687
DRAGO: Yes, it would appear that I have.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.359
BARON: You look like you've been pumping iron.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.361
MIRA: Yeah, you're looking super buff.

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:25.264
SPECTRA: Evolved again, I see.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.699
HELIOS: Still looks like nothing to me.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:30.569
DRAGO: It seems that New Vestroia is okay now.

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:33.171
Good. Very good.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.107
HELIOS: Hmmmphh. Big deal.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.142
DRAGO: Helios...

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.944
HELIOS: You just keep evolving like you think

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.446
you can gain the advantage on me.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.649
HELIOS: The truth is, you never will.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.817
And I'll take you down to prove it.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.420
DRAGO: It never ends with you.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:51.390
HELIOS: [growl]

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.792
MIRA: [gasp]

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.596
MIRA: So what's his problem, Keith?

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.765
Are we not on the same team now?

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.834
We fought well together didn't we...?

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.704
MIRA: Keith why...?

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:06.872
DAN: He's Spectra.

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.541
SPECTRA: Mira, I told you when we started this

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.877
not to mistake us for partners, didn't I?

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.478
I work alone.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.581
MIRA: But Keith...

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:19.685
SPECTRA: Time to go, Helios.

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:21.086
DAN: Spectra!

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:26.625
DAN: Come on...

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:28.460
Can't we all just get along?

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:35.234
HELIOS: Just wait, Drago... Next time we meet,

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:38.537
I'm gonna pound you into the ground.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.106
DRAGO: Until then.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:45.510
HELIOS: I am the Ultimate Bakugan.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.993
DAN: We'll see.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.069
BARON: Hey guys, Baron here.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.138
After we destroyed the Bakugan Termination System

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.207
on New Vestroia we headed back to Earth

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.175
for some much needed rest.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.811
I didn't want my Brawling skills to get rusty

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.647
so I hopped onto the Bakugan Interspace System

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.948
right away.

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.483
There were so many strange Bakugan in there,

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.952
it really blew my mind.

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:29.521
BARON: I'm telling you it was a real trip,

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:30.956
but maybe you should check it out yourselves

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.157
to see what I mean.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.392
Right Nemus?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.626
NEMUS: Let's go!

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.694
BARON: Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.195
BARON: Time to dance, pal!
