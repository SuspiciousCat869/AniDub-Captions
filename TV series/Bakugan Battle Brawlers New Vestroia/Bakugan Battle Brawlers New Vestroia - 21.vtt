00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.975
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.678
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.547
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.417
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.652
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.187
Resistance!

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.890
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.694
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.195
[battle squawk]

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.430
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:33.800
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:45.412
[\u266a]

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:55.054

[agonizing pain]

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.018
[enduring pain]

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.920
[closed mouth, evil chuckle]

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.825
Yes... yes... excellent...

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.828
With this data I will finally be able to create

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.430
the most powerful, mechanical Bakugan in the

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.765
entire realm!

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.134
Nonsense!

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.135
Yes.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.404
A mechanical Bakugan is strong.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.541
But only a Cyborg Bakugan can be the ultimate in power!

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.444
Helios , what are you saying?

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.080
You wish to endure the transformation?

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:58.551
I understand that I can never revert back once it has begun.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.020
But it's worth the sacrifice to become more

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.623
powerful than all other Bakugan!

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.091
[closed-mouth evil chuckle]

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.326
[painful groan]

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.427
Helios...

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.128
My Bakugan...

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.930
I am happy to grant your wish...

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.234
[\u266a]

The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Brotherly Love\".

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.775
You're lying!

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.944
There's no way Mira betrayed us!!

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.312
I won't believe it!

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.447
Stop it, Ace!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.549
I didn't want to believe it either, Ace...

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.817
But...

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.051
It's the truth.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.052
It can't be!

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.187
Mira and I...

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.256
were fighting to free the Bakugan long before you

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.991
came here...

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.559
She'd never betray us...

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.661
She devoted her life to the cause.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.530
It doesn't make sense to me...

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.597
But I...

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.299
know what I saw and heard.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.433
If you don't stop, I'll...

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.668
Calm down, Ace!

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.336
He's telling you the truth.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.606
Stop it Ace....Mira...

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.774
left willingly...

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.809
with Spectra.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.311
Enough...

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.813
Arguing won't bring her back.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.849
[shoving effort]

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.117
It's weird...

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.287
I never would have guessed that Spectra was Mira's brother.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.022
Me neither.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.356
Try to forget it...

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.859
We've got to get moving... to Gamma City.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.294
Shun is right.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:18.331
The mission remains the same no matter what happens.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.599
Right.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.435
Ace, we're counting on you.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.504
I know...

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.538
Mira...

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.145
Mira. Are you all right?

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.014
[gasp] ... I'm okay.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:51.230
They'll never forgive me for what I've done.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.999
How could they?

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:56.135
I wouldn't understand if I were them.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.270
We'll work it out.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.476
Hi Gus.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.980
Get changed...

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:10.016
Master Spectra wants to see you.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.898
Leave us.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.775
Please, take a seat.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.777
What do you want with me?

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.746
Is it so strange to share...

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.448
a meal with my dear sister?

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.757
Mira...

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.259
Give me a chance.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:57.730
I have missed you during this time.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.299
Do you remember...

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.768
when we were children and we'd battle each other...

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.204
how frustrated you would get when you lost?

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.174
You didn't bring me here to go through old memories.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.275
You're right...

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:13.613
There are more important things to talk about...

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.182
I know you want to ask me something.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.888
...Tell me why you're doing this...

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.323
You've disguised yourself, then asked the Resistance

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:25.558
to join you...

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:26.826
It doesn't make any sense.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.331
The ultimate Bakugan.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.102
Through my battles I have learned that there is one

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.006
Bakugan that has the capability to take over this world...

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.110
It is able to control the powers of all six Attributes...

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:47.213
And that one, ultimate Bakugan is...

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.982
the perfect Dragonoid.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.354
[mighty battle roar]

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:57.557
I realized that if I could harness this Bakugan, the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.395
future of New Vestroia would be in the palm of my hand.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.864
Is it Drago?

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.232
It is...

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.735
But I knew a Brawler like Dan Kuso would not leave

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.571
the dragonoid in my hands for long so I formed an

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.406
alternate plan.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.841
Create my own...

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:19.879
I took the data I needed and now my goal is within reach.

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.581
[mechanical battle roar]

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:24.083
These many years working in the lab and battling in

00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:27.353
the arena have finally paid off.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:30.089
Soon I will challenge the Royal Family itself and

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:34.727
take my place as the ultimate ruler of our world.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.797
How can...

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.931
you do this?

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.299
[assorted battle roars]

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.034
[running panting]

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.304
Bakugan are living beings...

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.373
They're just like you and me...

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.775
You think...

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.643
that you can just create one...

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.479
then use it to take over the world?

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.648
What do you need all that power for anyway?

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.783
Tell me that!

00:06:58.651 --> 00:06:59.619
[amused snort]

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.387
...What a silly question...

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.157
I want power for power's sake.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.992
What's wrong with that?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.761
Imagine...

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.396
Once the royal family is removed, nothing will

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.799
stand in my way...

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.734
And with you by my side...

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.335
we shall rule the world.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.371
[horrified gasp]

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.275
I'm sorry...

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:25.344
I can't do that...

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.214
I thought that maybe I could reach you...

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.449
that you were still my brother...

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.984
but you're a monster...

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.886
I don't recognize you anymore.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.322
But that doesn't even seem to bother you...

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:40.693
How can you just sit there so calmly?

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:44.130
I'm all alone... Mira.

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:47.967
Please, I need you.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.102
My poor brother...

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.272
You really thought that I would agree?

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.414
I see you need more time...

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:04.283
But I won't wait forever.

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.468
Was that wise, Master Spectra?

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:25.104
She's only been with the Vexos a short time but you

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.073
told her so much.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:28.808
Interesting...

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.878
So you were listening at the door, Gus?

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.145
I was...

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.649
But I only did it because I'm becoming worried about you.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.150
Don't bother...

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.820
I can handle my own sister Gus...

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.189
She will come around eventually.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.091
And if she doesn't?

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.325
Enough...

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.294
You underestimate the job ahead of us.

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:52.398
We need Mira and the powers of the Bakugan on our side...

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:55.835
And that's why, Gus, removing my mask is such a

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.570
small price to pay.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.838
But...

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.140
All I ask is that you trust me...

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.209
Do you think you can do that?

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.044
I need to know.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.213
Yes, Master Spectra.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:17.423
[\u266a]

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:21.694
We shall rule the world.

[confused sigh]

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:28.601
What am I going to do?

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.203
Wilda...

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.639
What am I going to do?

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.511
Please tell me.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:41.314
I am your partner.

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.817
I trust you.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.721
Where you go, I will follow.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.757
Thank you.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.768
Spectra.

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.470
Mira.

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.505
I have an offer...

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.675
Will you battle with me?

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.711
And what will happen if I do?

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.646
I am a Bakugan Brawler...

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:18.317
I will let the battle decide my future.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.587
Fair enough.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.123
Tomorrow morning on the battlefield then.

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.297
Lucky girl.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.433
You'll be the first to fall before my greatest creation.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.336
Isn't that right, Helios?

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:39.939
[confident chuckle]

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.907
[battle roar]

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.443
[small, closed mouth chuckle]

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.180
Beware Mira!

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.415
You're in over your head!

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.551
I'm back in the game!

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.353
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.700
I'm glad you suggested this.

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:11.003
I've been looking forward to a rematch.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:14.874
Good, but first ... you'll have to accept the stakes...

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.376
I warn you, they're high.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.978
If I win, Keith...

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.781
you'll be my brother again.

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:23.416
That's fine...

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.017
But what if I win?

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:28.287
What will you do for me then, Mira?

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:31.524
It's only fair that...

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.025
if I lose...

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.594
then I will be at your command.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.598
...It's a deal.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.633
Go Gauntlet...

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.169
Power Strike!

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:46.038
Gate Card... Set!

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.777
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.146
Wilda Stand!

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.849
[ready for battle roar]

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:59.351
Come on Wilda! I need all your strength!

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.986
You got it, Mira!

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.089
You'll need it...

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.424
Against my Ultimate Bakugan...

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.827
Pyrus Cyborg Helios!

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.162
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.764
Bakugan Stand!

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:22.708
[excited, feeling powerful growl]

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:25.845
Calculating Power Levels

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.246
How could...

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.181
you do that to Helios? !

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:38.757
[\u266a]

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:43.395
So much power...

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.997
[triumphant growl]

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.932
You're a monster.

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.534
A monster?

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.302
Hah!

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:54.140
Foolish girl, I am your worst nightmare!

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:59.111
With the power of this new body I am now the ultimate Bakugan.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.213
Even Drago can't defeat me!

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.549
Mira! Let's go!

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:04.617
Okay...

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.185
We'll make this quick...

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:08.821
Gate Card... Open!

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.223
Subterra Reactor!

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.629
That evens the playing field.

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.230
Ability Card Set.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.732

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.367

[battle roar]

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.541
[confident laughter] Gotcha!

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:31.310
And now, Double Ability Activate!

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.645
Ability Card Set.

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:35.514
Iron Plate plus Vulcano Hammer!

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.188
[ad lib sumo grunts]

[gathering power roar]

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:51.030
[attack roar]

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.164
[struggle/effort]

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.333
Increase 200

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.601
You got him!

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.204
'Fraid not.

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:01.507
[effort]

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.609
[dismissive grunt] ... Nice try.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:04.910
Oh no!

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.747
Hands off, weakling!

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.685
Enough of these childish games...

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.453
Ability Card Set.

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:18.457
Ability... Activate. Farbas!

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.558
Huh? ! [surprised gasp]

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.193
Diagnostic complete.

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.928
Gun Lock damage two percent.

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.997

Iron Plate damage seven percent.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.969

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.540

[confident chuckle]

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.715
There's not a scratch!

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.016
It's Farbus...

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.085
A special ability we've given Cyborg Pyrus

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:47.353
Helios...

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:51.257
It allows him to repair all damage done during a battle.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.426
Which means all your attacks will be useless.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.296
So you might as well give up now, Mira.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:00.799
All defense systems online.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.102
Opponent Scan complete...

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:06.372
Raising Power Level plus 350.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.074
No way...

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:10.909
You're telling me it's learning as we battle?

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.344
Not only that...

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.013
Farbus also makes sure that no matter how high an opponent's

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:18.317
Power Level rises, Helios' level will rise to meet it.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.787
Then we're right back where we started!

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.821
[confident grunt]

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:23.822
And that...

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:26.258
is the power of Cyborg Helios!

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:27.393
[confident growl]

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.028

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.731
... Yes! Come Bakugan Trap...

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.300

[ready for battle growl]

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:42.141
We have to hit him hard before his systems can recover.

Ability Activate!

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.544

[mocking grunt] Too slow!

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:56.155
We're not done yet!

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.791
You'll see.. Double Ability Activate!

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:01.660
Ability Card Set!

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.397
Flai Roller plus Vulcano Hammer!

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:07.199
[effort]

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.970
Calculating Power Levels

[battle roar]

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.773
So confident...

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.208
So foolish...

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.576

Defuse Quasar!

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.884
There you are!

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.686
Attack Systems Operational.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.788

[pain]

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:37.162
Wilda! Baliton!

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:40.065
You can't help them now.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.533
[defeated growl]

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:48.874
[\u266a]

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:49.975
Hmmm.

[\u266a]

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.583
He's so powerful...

00:16:57.616 --> 00:17:01.787
even Baliton and Wilda together can't defeat him.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.322
Mira...

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.190
What will you do now?

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.359
[closed-mouth frustration]

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.261
Mira!

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:10.896
We can't stop now.

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.398
We'll fight to the end.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.800
What do you say?

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.869
I say...

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:17.936
You...

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.471
haven't won yet!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:21.106
Bring it on, Keith!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.411
I admire your fighting spirit, my sister.

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.713
Gate Card Open!

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.498
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.500

[ready for battle roar]

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.203
It all rides on this...

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.738
Here we go, Wilda!

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.740
I'm ready, Mira!

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:57.576
Okay then...

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:58.977
Come Bakugan Trap...

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.345

[ready for battle growl]

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.724
It's useless no matter what you do.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.126
Is the test run...

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:15.461
complete Helios?

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:19.298
Yes, all systems are online and fully loaded.

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:21.667
Let's show them what I can do.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.069
This was a test run?

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:25.370
Of course it was...

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.606
First I needed to test my ultimate Bakugan against a

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.409
strong opponent like you Mira.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.511
That wasn't full power?

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:34.079
Not even close.

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:36.648
You're only worth 20 percent.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.916
What? ! ! !

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.384
Engage... Helios!

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:42.254

[attack roar]

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.795

[attack roar]

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:17.523
Spectra, it's time for the final blow.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.158
Yes Helios.

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:21.627
Show them why we shall reign supreme...

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.030
Why you're the greatest Bakugan of all!

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:26.832
Get ready, Mira!

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:31.937
I have to cancel out Helios' abilities before he attacks!

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.339
Ability activate.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:35.807

What's that do?

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.650
Nothing much really...

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.786
Just shuts down any abilities opponents activate.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:58.764
[\u266a]

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.832
Look at that!

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:06.038
That's unbelievable!

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.973
Hmmph! Missed...

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:11.543
The computer must still be adapting to my body's senses.

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.013
Targeting system realigned.

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.785
[over the top attack roar]

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.253
Wilda! Baliton!

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:26.758
[painful effort]

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:41.740
[\u266a]

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.775
That's it... I lost...

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:46.178
Your Cyborg Helios is too strong...

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.113
I know.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:50.182
From now on you are an enemy of the Bakugan

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.750
Brawlers Resistance.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:54.753
Welcome to the Vexos, Mira Fermin.

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:57.422
[confident/triumphant chuckle]

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:02.094
[\u266a]

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.295
I'm sorry...

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.997
my friends.

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:08.400
Hey Brawlers!

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.636
Next time we get to Gamma City and find the last

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:13.405
Dimension Controller is deep underground.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.341
If we destroy it, the Bakugan will finally be free!

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.944
But first we have get past the Vexos!

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.445
No prob!

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.047
Baron... he's all yours.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.782
See? Easy!

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:26.084
Shun! You take care of Shadow Prove!

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.786
So what if we're outnumbered?

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.921
We're the only ones who can save the Bakugan!

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.157
And nothing's gonna stop us now!

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.892
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.527
Never give up!

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:47.005
