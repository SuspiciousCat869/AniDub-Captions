WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.309
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.611
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.381
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.350
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.586
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.921
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.323
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.426
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.328
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.997
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.599
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:33.733
and the stake are high.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.368
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:45.445
[\u266a]

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:55.088
[\u266a]

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:17.077
[\u266a]

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:23.950
[\u266a]

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.351
SPECTRA: [frustrated grunt]

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.555
Drago and Helios have faced off several times now and

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.391
still we've yet to be victorious.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.559
SPECTRA: It's embarrassing!

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.661
HELIOS: Drago's been lucky. That's all.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:37.864
HELIOS: My strength and abilities are far superior.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:38.998
SPECTRA: Perhaps.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.568
But your track record says otherwise.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.336
SPECTRA: You are powerful, but in addition to

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.405
possessing the Perfect Core Energy, Drago has

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.540
also evolved after being bestowed with one of the

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.008
attribute energies.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.645
You are mighty Helios, but Drago is perhaps even mightier.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.214
HELIOS: Nonsense!

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.649
HELIOS: Drago isn't the only one who has evolved.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.620
With the amount of powers I have acquired I can beat anyone.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.356
I am perfection!

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.792
SPECTRA: Ahhh, the perfect evolution.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.227
GUS: Master Spectra!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.361
GUS: You need to hear this.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.264
Sensors are showing that the Vexos are on the move.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.465
SPECTRA: What?

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.034
GUS: Sir, it appears that they are heading toward Earth.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.669
My guess is that they've found the Brawlers' hiding

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:20.106
spot and are going after the remaining attribute energies.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.708
GUS: If they're successful in attaining them we'll be

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.877
helpless in stopping them from launching the Bakugan

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.945
Termination System.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.046
SPECTRA: Perhaps this is a blessing

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.582
in disguise...Our final window of opportunity to

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.918
capture the Perfect Core Energy.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.319
SPECTRA: You wanted another chance to prove

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.655
yourself...this is it Helios.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.824
Are you ready for a final showdown with Drago...

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.626
All or nothing?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.596
HELIOS: I will destroy Drago. Once and for all.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.365
Believe it!

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.634
SPECTRA: Hmmph.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.941
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: All or Nothing.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.345
DAN: This is bad!

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.248
DAN: The Vexos know exactly where we are now.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.217
DAN: They could be here any second!

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.451
DRAGO: Take it easy, Dan.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.619
DAN: Huh?

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.255
DRAGO: We knew we couldn't hide from them forever.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.591
DAN: But we don't have a defense plan.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.159
SHUN: Then maybe...

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.228
SHUN: ...we should change tactics, go on the attack

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.729
and storm the Mother Palace.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:17.931
ALL: [gasp]

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.366
SHUN: When I saw the BT System in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.802
action in New Vestroia it seemed like it was being

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:25.338
operated by remote control.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.839
SHUN: It would make sense that Zenoheld was doing

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.274
this from the Mother Palace.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.475
DAN: So instead of protecting the attribute

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.779
energies, we switch our focus to destroying the machine.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:33.980
DAN: I love it!

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:37.083
Let's go pound that BT System into a pile of rubble!

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.218
BARON: Yeah! That way we can keep the Bakugan and

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.720
New Vestroia free!

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.689
RUNO: Just make sure you don't leave us behind this time.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.390
JULIE: Yeah, we want in!

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.260
BILLY: I wanna help too. You can count on me.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.028
DAN: Okay! We'll all go together.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.196
RUNO/JULIE: Yay!

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.332
ACE: And how exactly do we get there?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.567
DAN: Huh? What d'ya mean?

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.437
MARUCHO: [grunt as he jumps] Hey.. Ace is right,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.439
y'know...since it was destroyed we still haven't

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.907
managed to rebuild Dr. Michael's Dimension

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.542
Transporter System.

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.177
MIRA: And even if it was working, we have no idea

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.879
where the Mother Palace is...How are we supposed

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.448
to transport ourselves somewhere when we don't

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.617
know it's exact location?

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.518
DAN: [grunt] Then we find someone who does know

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.088
where it is!

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.956
RUNO: But who?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.058
RUNO: Only the Vexos know the location of the Palace...

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.795
And I really don't think they're gonna tell us!

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.665
DAN: There has to be a way...huh... [chuckle]

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.103
DAN: There is someone else who knows.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:32.705
DAN: And he hates the Vexos just as much as we do.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:34.207
DAN: We just need to convince him that he

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.875
should help us.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:37.310
SHUN: Hmmm?

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.679
DRAGO: You're not suggesting...?

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.981
DAN: The ex-leader of the Vexos...

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.784
DAN: ...Spectra!

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.419
[\u266a]

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.520
DRAGO: What?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.557
MIRA: MARUCHO: Hah... You're joking...a little humour to

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.625
lighten the mood right?

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.260
RUNO: You can't be serious, Dan.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.428
DAN: Yup.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.929
ACE: And I thought Baron had rocks for

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.165
brains...Have you lost your mind buddy?

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.501
DAN: Hold on a sec...the Vexos are the greatest

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.069
threat we face now.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.337
Asking Spectra for help may seem odd, but it's our

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.105
best choice.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.674
ACE: Our best choice? !

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:10.009
BARON: It doesn't seem like much of a choice at all.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.578
SHUN: Like the Vexos, Spectra is in hiding.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:14.480
How would we contact him?

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.916
DAN: I dunno. C'mon, work with me here guys!

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.552
I don't see any of you shooting out any better ideas.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.753
MIRA: There's no point.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.021
DAN: Huh? !

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.725
MIRA: He wouldn't trust any of us.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.627
MIRA: Even though he's my brother...

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.995
or at least used to be.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:47.980
SHADOW PROVE: [evil laughter]

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.918
Oh yeah, baby...I'm gonna get me another attribute energy.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:54.220
SHADOW PROVE: The Brawlers won't know what hit 'em.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:55.521
MYLENE: Oh relax.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.090
VOLT: Yeah, take it easy.

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.624
It's a little early to be celebrating.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.494
SHADOW PROVE: Hmmph. Stick in the mud.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.630
OPERATOR: Sensors are picking up a signal from a

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.932
Dimensional Transporter.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.900
VOLT: How is that possible?

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.937
Shadow Prove destroyed the Earth's transporter.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.805
OPERATOR: The signal isn't coming from Earth, sir.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.373
It's origin appears to be from a completely

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.676
different universe.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.878
MYLENE: A different universe?

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:31.257
[\u266a]

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.195
DRAGO: I really think you should reconsider, Dan.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.499
DRAGO: Why on Earth would Spectra ever cooperate with us?

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:43.402
DAN: Well, normally he wouldn't...but...I still

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.571
have to figure out a way to convince him.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:48.307
DAN: Otherwise we're finished...for good.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:56.382
DAN: We've got a lot in common.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.784
DRAGO: This is true.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.485
You're both fearsome Brawlers.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.789
And live your lives according to a similar code. But...

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.791
DRAGO: There will come a day, when one of you

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.894
doesn't walk away at the end of a battle.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.363
DAN: Yeah. I know.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.465
RUNO: Hey! What are you two whispering about?

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.033
DAN: Nothing.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:17.503
RUNO: [giggles] You're a terrible fibber, Dan.

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:19.639
RUNO: Go ahead and keep your silly secrets.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:21.808
In the meantime, come eat with us.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.709
DAN: [chuffs] Okay.

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.378
DAN: I am kinda starving.

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.079
DAN: And a full stomach always helps me think better.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.348
DRAGO: [laughs] You and me both, Dan.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.651
DAN: [laughter] Huh?

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:32.652
RUNO: Dan!

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.587

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.256

RUNO: Guys! It's Dan! He's disappeared!

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.865
MIRA: We saw it...On the monitor.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.200
RUNO: [gasp]

SPECTRA: Don't I get a hello?

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.184
Where are your manners?

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.986
SPECTRA: I expected better from the leader of

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.454
the Brawlers.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.590
SPECTRA: Sorry about the smash and grab but I

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:12.692
didn't think you'd come willingly.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.694
GUS: I trust the transport was painless.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.429
I did my best to be gentle.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.164
DAN: Gus! Spectra!

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.999
DRAGO: You've got nerve taking us against our

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.801
will...What do you want?

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.369
GUS: Silence!

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.504
How dare you speak to Master Spectra like -

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.240
SPECTRA: Just relax...

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.175
SPECTRA: Why get hung up on manners?

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.509
We should be discussing the real reason they're

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:34.280
here...The Perfect Core Energy that Drago possesses.

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.282
HELIOS: He means the Perfect Core Energy that's

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:38.484
about to become mine!

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.419
DRAGO: Try it, Helios!

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:43.389
DAN: Hah! It's actually kind of funny we should meet like this.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:45.591
We were all just talking about you guys.

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.827
SPECTRA: Oh?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.563
DAN: We want you to show us where the Mother Palace is.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.798
DAN: Take us there and we'll fight Zenoheld and

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.233
the Vexos together!

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:56.102
GUS: Us work with you? Are you crazy?

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.271
HELIOS: They're just stalling because they're

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.473
too afraid to battle us.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:03.643
DRAGO: Be quiet, Helios, and let him speak.

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.211
HELIOS: What did you say?

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:07.013
SPECTRA: In case you hadn't noticed, Dan...I

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.981
don't exactly play well with others.

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:10.983
SPECTRA: And the Brawlers would be the last people

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.018
I'd partner with.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.452
DAN: Mira told me about you.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.954
DAN: You want to destroy Zenoheld.

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.956
SPECTRA: Hah! [laughter] Did she now?

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.559
It's a little more...complicated, than

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.627
my dear sister thinks, I'm afraid.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:22.762
DAN: Huh?

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.730
SPECTRA: My one true goal is to create a completely

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.366
evolved living organism unlike anything the world

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.736
has seen...My dream, my mission is to create

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.038
The Ultimate Bakugan

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.339
DAN: Say what?

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.907
HELIOS: It's true...

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.209
HELIOS: The ultimate being will be more powerful and

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.613
glorious than anything that has come before.

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:46.218
I will be the ultimate Bakugan and all will bow down to me!

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.587
HELIOS: The only thing left for me to do in order

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.456
to fulfill my destiny is to take the Perfect Core

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.925
Energy from you Drago.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.962
SPECTRA: So there you have it. My little plan.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.697
DAN: Can a Bakugan that mighty exist?

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.366
Do you think that's even possible, Drago?

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.201
DRAGO: I don't know.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.936
DRAGO: But meddling with the natural order of

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.305
things can never end well.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.975
DRAGO: Spectra's actions will have consequences.

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.509
DAN: Just hang on a second.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.612
DAN: This ultimate creation of yours that

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.714
you've been talking about...At the end of the

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.148
day, it's still a Bakugan, right?

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:20.119
DAN: If that's true then...when the BT System

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.455
is activated it will be just as deadly to him as

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:24.757
all of the other Bakugan. So there.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.791
SPECTRA: [gasp]

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:26.859
DAN: Come on!

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.829
You can't just stand by and let it happen...

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.063
It would be horrible.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.411
DAN: Help us. Together we can stop the Vexos!

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.146
DRAGO: Together.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.848
SPECTRA: You may have a valid point, but I'm not

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.383
just going to roll over for you, Dan.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.485
SPECTRA: We both have something the other wants.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:54.253
So why not put it to a duel.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:55.554
DAN: A duel?

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.490
SPECTRA: Helios versus Drago.

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.359
If we lose, I will take you to the palace, without delay.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:02.762
DAN: Huh? For real?

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.231
SPECTRA: Sure. But if I win...

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.099
SPECTRA: ...then you will surrender the Perfect Core

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.234
Energy to me!

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:09.335
DAN: Are you serious?

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:10.403
DRAGO: Dan!

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.437
HELIOS: What's wrong?

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.073
Afraid you'll lose, Drago?

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.808
SPECTRA: What do you say, Dan?

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.711
DAN: I say: Let's get it done!

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.479
DRAGO: You're going down, Helios!

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:24.950
HELIOS: I've been waiting a long time for this, Drago!

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:29.622
DRAGO: I'm ready for you Helios!

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.728
JULIE: Dan's in that spaceship up there, really?

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.463
SHUN: Yes, I think so.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.764
BARON: Oh man!

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:41.033
We can't just sit here and do nothing while he's in there.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.468
RUNO: Dan....

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:44.470
ACE: We have to find a way inside.

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.771
Dan might need our help.

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.006
BILLY: I'm with ya!

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.808
MARUCHO: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:49.975
ACE: Yeah!

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:51.243
MIRA: Hold on, guys! Wait!

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.945
SPECTRA/DAN: Gauntlet! Power Strike!

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.682
MARUCHO: Daaaaan!

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.351
SPECTRA: Gate Card, set!

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.288
SPECTRA: Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.890
SPECTRA: Bakugan Stand!

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.125
HELIOS: [rising mighty roar] I'm ready to

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:08.661
destroy you, Drago!

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.496
HELIOS: We won't be the needing the canister.

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:13.599
HELIOS: I'm going to rip Drago to pieces, all by myself.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:14.633
GUS: Don't be crazy!

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:15.968
HELIOS: Stay out of my way, Gus.

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.772
This victory will be mine alone.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:21.307
DAN: Are you still yappin'?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.742
Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.710
DAN: Bakugan Stand!

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:27.713
Pyrus Cross Dragonoid!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.850
DRAGO: [migty roar]

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:35.621
[\u266a]

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.256
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.391
HELIOS: I'm gonna savour every moment of this.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.360
HELIOS: Do you hear me?

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:43.028
Haaaaaahhhhhh!

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:45.064
DRAGO: [grunt, pain] [grunt]

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.165
HELIOS: Get up!

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.800
I'm not done with you yet!

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:48.801
DRAGO: [exertion]

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:49.969
HELIOS: Smile!

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.337
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.673
[\u266a]

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.942
DAN: Man. He's so powerful.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:59.111
DRAGO: Dan!

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.013
DRAGO: Wait. Not yet.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.452
DRAGO: Didn't you hear what Dan said earlier?

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:09.588
If the BT System goes fully operational, then it

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.090
will mean death...

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.092
DRAGO: ...for all Bakugan.

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.493
DRAGO: How can you stand here and

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:19.098
continue to fight me when you know the horrible truth?

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.233
HELIOS: That has nothing to do with me.

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:22.668
DRAGO: What?

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:24.904
HELIOS: All I care about right now...

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:27.940
HELIOS: ...is destroying you...Drago!

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.108
[\u266a]

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.176
DRAGO: Aaaarrrggghhhh.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.078
HELIOS: I won't rest until you're finished.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.680
DRAGO: [grunt, pain]

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.050
HELIOS: Now Spectra!

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.885
SPECTRA: Ability activate!

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:43.189
SPECTRA: Ragnarock Cannon!

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.625
HELIOS: Open wide!

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.527
[\u266a]

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.629
DAN: Ability activate.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.897
DAN: Superior Shield!

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.633
SPECTRA: He blocked the cannon!

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.136
HELIOS: [angry growl]

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.837
[\u266a]

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.806
DAN: Superior Shield is an ability that's...

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.875
DAN: ...unique to Pyrus Cross Dragonoid.

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:04.510
It nullifies the opponent's ability and ups

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:07.479
Drago's power level by 200!

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.382
HELIOS: You may think you've got me, but you're wrong!

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.352
SPECTRA: Gate Card, open!

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.087
SPECTRA: Flat Power!

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.790
[\u266a]

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:21.227
DRAGO: Why has my power level gone back down?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.995
SPECTRA: The Command Card Flat Power...

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.563
SPECTRA: ...returns the power levels of all the

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:27.700
Bakugans on the battlefield back to their base levels.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:30.536
Let's go Helios!

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:32.371
SPECTRA: Show Drago no mercy!

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:33.572
HELIOS: [mighty roar]

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.641
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:36.909
DRAGO: [collision and punching]

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:39.211
HELIOS: [collision and punching]

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:40.779
[\u266a]

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:43.282
GUS: They appear to be equally powerful.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.584
SPECTRA: It seems that the Bakugan's powerful will to

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:48.654
survive has allowed them to evolve infinitely,

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.056
constantly bettering themselves.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.459
Which means that the only way Helios will be able to

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.661
beat Drago is...

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:57.062
HELIOS: Haaaahhh!

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:59.398
DRAGO: [exertion]

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:00.733
SPECTRA: Interesting...

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.901
DRAGO: Haaaaaahhhh!

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:03.902
HELIOS: [grunt, pain]

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.971
DAN: Alright! Ability activate!

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:07.406
DAN: Shooting Dragon!

[\u266a]

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.249

Bakugan evolution.

I'll teach him to mind his manners.
