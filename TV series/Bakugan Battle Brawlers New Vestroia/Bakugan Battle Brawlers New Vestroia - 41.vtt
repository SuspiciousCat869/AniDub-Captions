WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.275
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.845
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with him

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.280
the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.350
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.352
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.788
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.256
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.159
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.328
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.997
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.565
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.833
and the stake are high.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.468
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.641
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.643
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.145
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.713
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.081
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.916
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.284
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.319
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.090
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:00.026
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.962
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.197
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.867
MYLENE: No matter how much an opponent tries to

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.804
decrease the power level of a Mechanical Bakugan,

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.006
its energy level will refuel automatically

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.041
MYLENE: and its power level will return to its

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.810
original base level.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.144
MYLENE: If you try to increase the power level

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.413
of a living Bakugan, the Trap Field will absorb

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:24.350
that power and its power level will revert to its base level.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.585
SHUN: Dan!

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.753
Where are you?

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.455
MARUCHO: You can't battle the Mechanical Bakugan

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.457
inside the Palace!

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.491
ACE: Mira!

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.726
BARON: We're coming!

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.632
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.036
BT: The Final Battle.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.170
PROFESSOR CLAY: Huh?

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.039
SPECTRA: Listen closely.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.841
I've got a proposition for you.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.275
PROFESSOR CLAY: A proposition?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.878
SPECTRA: I'd like to offer you a place at my side.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.146
PROFESSOR CLAY: What's that?

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.615
SPECTRA: Thanks to Zenoheld, I've lost Gus,

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.083
my loyal right hand.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.419
Luckily for you this has created a job opening.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.989
I will need someone with your superior technical abilities.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.225
PROFESSOR CLAY: How arrogant of you

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.761
to think that I would serve under a boy.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.230
SPECTRA: Perhaps you're the one who's being

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.332
arrogant Professor Clay.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:13.566
PROFESSOR CLAY: Hmmph.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.636
SPECTRA: Don't you want to hear what's in this for you?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.137
PROFESSOR CLAY: Go on.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.606
SPECTRA: In return for your service, I will give you

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.342
the key to the Bakugan's full DNA sequence.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.010
What do you say Professor?

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.013
Is that something you might be interested in?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.915
PROFESSOR CLAY: You have their full DNA sequence?

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.384
For real?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.654
SPECTRA: Would lie to my own father?

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:38.224
Let's do this and take down Zenoheld, together.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.326
PROFESSOR CLAY: You'll have to forgive my skepticism...

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.798
but I think we both know that we're no longer father and son.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.535
SPECTRA: We both have much to gain here.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.471
Can't we leave the past behind us and move forward?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.640
PROFESSOR CLAY: I have nothing more to say.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:54.974
PROFESSOR CLAY: Now leave Spectra,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.410
before I'm forced to summon the Palace Guards.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:05.752
[\u266a]

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.053
SPECTRA: With Gus' disappearance

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.688
and Professor Clay unwilling to join me

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.523
things are going to be difficult.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.392
SPECTRA: Still I cannot lose momentum.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.427
Especially since I am so close to having the DNA

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.696
sequence fully analyzed.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.232
SPECTRA: But I have to remember what Dan said.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.234
DAN: Just hang on a second.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.769
DAN: This ultimate creation of yours that

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.637
you've been talking about, at the end of the day it's

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.539
still a Bakugan, right?

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:30.176
If that's true then, when the BT System is activated

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.978
it will be just as deadly to him

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.613
as all of the other Bakugan.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.348
So there!

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.085
SPECTRA: How right you are, Dan Kuso.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.587
SPECTRA: Time is of the essence.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.355
If I wait any longer, I may never get my hands

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:45.024
on Drago's Perfect Core Energy.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.527
SPECTRA: I suppose it's now or never.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.701
PRINCE HYDRON: At long last, we finally meet, Dan Kuso.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.202
PRINCE HYDRON: I'm anxious to see if you're as good

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.004
as your reputation.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.839
DAN: You're Hydron, right?

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:03.343
PRINCE HYDRON: I see you've heard of me...

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.178
that's nice.

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.646
DAN: Ready Mira?

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.114
MIRA: Yup!

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.949
DAN: Spectra?

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.117
What?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.319
SPECTRA: I thought I'd help you take down Zenoheld.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:16.189
Isn't that what you wanted, Dan?

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.225
DAN: But I thought you said you were done helping us.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.660
SPECTRA: What can I say?

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.328
You made a convincing argument.

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.530
Like you said, if the BT System is activated

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:26.966
it will be bad for both of us.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.235
DAN: Whatever, dude... The more the merrier.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.638
Right Mira? Let's do this.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.440
PRINCE HYDRON: Welllll, this is quite a surprise.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.776
ZENOHELD: Are you people here to battle

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.045
or just stand around and talk?

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:43.149
MIRA: That's King Zenoheld.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.851
He used to be the ruler of Vestal.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.252
DAN: That dude?

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:50.156
DAN: He looks even meaner in person.

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.958
SPECTRA: You and I have a score to settle

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.393
for what you did to Gus.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.296
ZENOHELD: Ah yes, Gus, your little lap dog.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.665
Don't worry, he was loyal to his Master Spectra

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.266
until the end.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.135
SPECTRA: Good help is hard to find and Gus won't

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.836
easily be replaced.

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.240
You'll pay for taking him from me.

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:10.576
PRINCE HYDRON: And so, the drama just keeps on coming.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.745
ALL: Gauntlet, Power Strike!

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:16.582
PRINCE HYDRON: I appreciate your interest,

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.018
father, but I can handle this on my own.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.821
There's no reason for you to inconvenience yourself.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:24.023
ZEONHELD: Your record has been impressive.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.191
Very well.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.392
As you wish.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.162
PRINCE HYDRON: Gate Card, set!

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.832
PRINCE HYDRON: Let's go, Subterra Dryoid!

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.134
Bakugan brawl!

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.869
PRINCE HYDRON: Bakugan stand!

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.340
MIRA: We've got some Subterra muscle of our own.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.143
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.912

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.484
DAN: Let's bring Pyrus to the party...

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.419
Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:57.857
DAN: Bakugan, stand!

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.160
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.097
SPECTRA: Helios, time to show them real power...

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.965
Bakugan Brawl!

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.735
SPECTRA: Bakugan stand!

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:11.938
HELIOS: [mighty roar]

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:14.107
PRINCE HYDRON: Hah...show off.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.608
DRAGO: Can I trust that we're fighting together, Helios

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.578
or do I have to watch my back?

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.680
HELIOS: Don't think for a second we're a team.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.015
DRAGO: HELIOS: I won't attack you but make sure

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:26.552
you don't get in my way.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.087
DRAGO: PRINCE HYDRON: This is why non-mechanical

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.056
Bakugan are so inferior.

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.258
Too much talk, not enough brawling.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.793
MIRA: Then let me help you with that.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.962

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.693
MIRA: [grunt]

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.329
WILLDA: Mira!

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.001
MIRA: [whimper]

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.504
PRINCE HYDRON: Okay, that's one down.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.407
DAN: Mira, say something! You creep!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.942
Who hits a girl like that?

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.610
PRINCE HYDRON: Boy...girl...

00:07:57.643 --> 00:07:58.644
all I see is Brawler.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.314
PRINCE HYDRON: Fusion Ability, activate!

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.616
Restu Lightning!

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:11.123
DAN: Drago!

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.292
PRINCE HYDRON: Right... they're both Pyrus Bakugan,

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.393
aren't they...

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.431
PRINCE HYDRON: Gate Card, open!

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.333
PRINCE HYDRON: Pyrus Spotting Out!

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.601
DAN: Say what?

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.002
PRINCE HYDRON: This gate card slashes Pyrus

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.538
Bakugan's power levels by 500.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.906
SPECTRA: Helios!

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.441
DAN: Huh?

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:30.710
SPECTRA: Ability activate!

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.278
SPECTRA: Chaos Hyper Cannon!

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:36.582
HELIOS: Haaaaahhhh!

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.488
DRAGO: Helios, what did you do?

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.258
HELIOS: I told you not to get in my way, Drago.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.728
Perhaps you'd better sit the rest of this battle out.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:51.464
I wouldn't want you to scrape your knee.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.333
DRAGO: Hah! Stand back, Helios!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.069
DAN: Yeah! Ability activate!

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:59.272
DAN: Shooting Dragon!

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.673
DRAGO: Haaaaaaahhhh!

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:07.246
[\u266a]

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.948
DAN: We did it!

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:09.949
Huh?

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:14.287
[\u266a]

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:20.192
DAN: What the...? How the heck is he still standing?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.962
DAN: And why did Drago and Helios' power levels decrease?

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.564
PRINCE HYDRON: I could tell you, but then I would

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.198
ruin the surprise.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.237
SHUN: Guys we're too late!

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.439
ACE: Hmmm? Mira?

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.675
MARUCHO: Mira!

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.376
DAN: Huh? You guys...?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.945
MARUCHO: Dan, listen!

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.280
This battlefield is actually a Vexos trap!

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.548
DAN: What'd you say?

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:44.150
SHUN: It absorbs the powers of the flesh

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.918
and blood Bakugan

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.720
then transfers them to any Mechanical Bakugan

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.255
who are brawling.

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:50.690
PRINCE HYDRON: Oh come on, Shun.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.291
Did you have to tell my friend?

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:54.293
No one likes a tattle tale you know.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.462
SPECTRA: Oh yeah? A trap field?

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.764
So that's what you were up to, Professor Clay.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:02.001
PROFESSOR CLAY: You're always one step behind, Spectra.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.038
MIRA: Huh? Ace?

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.540
ACE: I'm right here.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.874
SHUN: Mira! What happened?

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:11.177
Why are you and Dan battling with Spectra.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.778
DAN: They tricked us.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.780
Now what are we gonna do, huh?

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:16.215
SPECTRA: Perhaps it's time that we try out

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.683
some new equipment.

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.487
HELIOS: Let's do it, Spectra.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.156
I'm itching to destroy something.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.725
DAN: Hey, do you guys wanna fill us in

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.460
a little here?

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.929
SPECTRA: Sit back and watch.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.602
GAUNTLET: Ready, Twin Destructor.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.476
SPECTRA: Battle Gear, Boost!

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.553
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasp]

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.769
HELIOS: [mighty roar]

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.805
PRINCE HYDRON: Battle Gear?

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.607
That sounds like nothing more

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.742
than a gimmick to me Spectra.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.345
PROFESSOR CLAY: Prince Hydron,

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.747
you couldn't be any more wrong.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.188
SPECTRA: Helios!

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.223
Let's show them what Battle Gear is all about!

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.227
DAN: Watch yourself, Drago!

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:36.695
This is gonna be a fierce Brawl!

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:42.168
HELIOS: So Brawlers, how do you like me now?

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:45.337
DRAGO: Helios...it's...

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.273
...incredible.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.809
HELIOS: My only regret, Drago, is that you won't be

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.445
the first victim of my Battle Gear.

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:53.846
SPECTRA: Stay focused.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:57.316
Remember that the Vexos are our current enemy.

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:59.885
HELIOS: Drago's time will come.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.789
GAUNTLET: Ability Card, set.

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:06.225
SPECTRA: Battle Gear Ablity, activate!

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.594
SPECTRA: Dual Devastator!

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.438
DAN: Yeah! Nice one!

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:22.108
PRINCE HYDRON: What's happening, Professor Clay?

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.077
PROFESSOR CLAY: Such incredible power.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.012
PROFESSOR CLAY: But still, it won't be enough

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.881
to allow them a victory.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.551
SPECTRA: The Battle Gear's performance is even more

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.487
impressive than I imagined.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.089
Finally, we will put the Vexos and their giant

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:40.326
wind-up toys in their place.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.862
HELIOS: Come and get it, Vexos!

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:47.233
[mighty roar]

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:51.036
PROFESSOR CLAY: What's this?

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.772
Helios' energy isn't being absorbed.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.878
PROFESSOR CLAY: It appears that the system can't keep up

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.947
with the speed of Helios' power level increase.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:07.686
DAN: Battle Gear...

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.221
DRAGO: It's incredible.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.423
HELIOS: I could do this all day!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.336
PRINCE HYDRON: How can that be?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.871
Dryoid...

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:28.374
GAUNTLET: Prince Hydron Life force 10%.

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:35.247
DAN: Not too shabby there, Spectra.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.149
SPECTRA: Hmmmph.

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:39.084
PRINCE HYDRON: I might be down, but I'm not out yet,

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:40.486
Spectra.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.588
ZENOHELD: Stand aside, Hydron!

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:44.390
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasp] Father!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:47.626
ZENOHELD: Enough with these silly games.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.694
DAN: Hah!

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:50.996
Daddy comin' to clean up your mess, Hydron?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.834
SPECTRA: Gate Card, set!

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.036
SPECTRA: Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.605
SPECTRA: Bakugan stand!

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:03.943
HELIOS: [mighty roar]

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.844
ZENOHELD: Let's go Farbros!

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.180
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.616
ZENOHELD: Bakugan stand!

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.019
DAN: Alright, Drago buddy.

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:16.155
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.190
DAN: Bakugan stand!

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.826
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:22.127
BOTH: Come on!

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:24.496
ZENOHELD: Ability activate!

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.299
Twin Horn Phaser!

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.901
[grunting, pained cries]

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:30.936
ZENOHELD: First we'll take away 400 from each of your

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:36.642
power levels and then add 400 to mine!

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.010
ZENOHELD: Professor Clay!

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.345
PROFESSOR CLAY: I'll go ahead and increase

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.579
the power of the Trap Field System!

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.414
That should increase our power level by 200

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.949
for each attack!

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.621
DAN: Ability activate!

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.624
DAN: Superior Shield!

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.901
ZENOHELD: Ability activate!

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.737
ZENOHELD: Hyped Cell!

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.177
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.680
DAN: What the heck kind of a power is that Drago?

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.383
SPECTRA: Ability Activate!

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.818
SPECTRA: Precipice Shield.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.161
DRAGO: Thank-you for saving me.

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.830
HELIOS: I only did it so I can take you down later.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.609
DAN: Ah Man! Looks like he did it again!

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.044
It's making me nuts.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.146
SPECTRA: Yes, it is quite annoying.

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.348
ZENOHELD: You two need to be taught a lesson...

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.550
Double Ability activate!

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.252
GAUNTLET: Ability Card, set!

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.254
ZENOHELD: Hellion Breath, Plus...

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.523
...Ice Burst!

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.160
Hellion Breath takes half of the base power level

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:05.631
of a live Pyrus Bakugan and adds it to its own power level.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.832
And also...

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:08.567
you're blocked from activating any abilities.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.735
DAN: Oh no!

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.970
ZENOHELD: And Ice Burst literally freezes all

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:15.240
non-mechanical Bakugan.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.377
HELIOS: What's happening?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.851
SPECTRA: Enough!

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:29.421
Battle Gear, Boost!

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.366
SPECTRA: Gate Card, open!

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.867
SPECTRA: Enemy Re-setter!

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.306
SPECTRA: This Gate Card nullifies all of my

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.241
opponent's abilities.

00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:50.876
ZENOHELD: [angry grunt]

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.945
SPECTRA: And that's not all...

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.947
SPECTRA: This card is also synchronized

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.449
with the Battle Gear, doubling the attack powers

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:00.652
of the battle gear abilities.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:04.690
SPECTRA: Battle Gear, Ability activate!

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:07.893
SPECTRA: Twin Destructor Level 2!

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:11.864
PROFESSOR CLAY: Helios'attack powers doubled?

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.265
PROFESSOR CLAY: It seems as though the Trap Field

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:14.833
has no effect on him.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.236
PROFESSOR CLAY: But how is that even possible?

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:20.005
HELIOS: Yeah! Get some! Get some!

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.244
PROFESSOR CLAY: I don't believe it!

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.746
The Trap Field...

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.950
...it's breaking down!

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.252
SPECTRA: Okay!

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:34.753
Time to hit it, Dan!

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:35.988
DAN: Okay!

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.891
Ability activate!

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.293
Shooting Tornado!

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:48.367
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.643
PRINCE HYDRON: Father!

00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:00.446
ZENOHELD: You lousy punks!

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.847
PROFESSOR CLAY: Your Highness!

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.649
It seems that the combined power of Helios with the

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:05.050
Battle Gear and Drago...

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.585
PROFESSOR CLAY: ...are far greater than we could have

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.921
ever imagined...Farbros is unable to beat them

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:10.989
by conventional methods.

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.192
The only other option that I can see giving us a

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.527
chance at victory would be for you to absorb all

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.330
the energy on the field and then taking down

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:22.034
Drago and Helios.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.836
ZENOHELD: But we could collapse our side first...

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.804
It sounds too risky.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.105
PROFESSOR CLAY: It's true.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.074
There is a chance that Farbros could be destroyed

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.210
using this tactic.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.412
ZENOHELD: No guts. No glory.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.780
PROFESSOR CLAY: Agreed!

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:39.785
DRAGO: What's happening?

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:42.187
DAN: Man... their power levels are dropping fast!

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:45.057
SPECTRA: Helios!

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:48.794
PROFESSOR CLAY: Just hang on, Farbros.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:51.129
Drago and Helios are nearly done!

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.604
ZENOHELD: Time to nail their coffins shut!

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.507
Ability Activate!

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.176
ZENOHELD: Twin Horn Pulsar!

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.622
Ability Activate!

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.924
Fire Spartan!

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:27.332
DRAGO: [pained cry]

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.934
DAN: Drago!

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.469
SPECTRA: His Attribute Energy!

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.271
DAN: Dragooooo!

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.979
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.186
GAUNTLET: System Down.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.754
Battle Terminated.

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:50.055
DAN: [gasp]

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:51.623
MARUCHO: Dan!

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:54.293
ZENOHELD: Nice strategy Professor Clay.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:11.977
DAN: [gasp] Is that...?

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.012
SPECTRA: The BT System.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.981
ZENOHELD: We now have all of the Attribute Energies

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:19.718
required to fully power the Bakugan Termination System.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.469
Once the power core has had the time to fully

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:40.072
charged itself the System module in New Vestroia

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:42.674
will power itself up.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:49.081
[laughter]

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:50.816
DAN: No way!

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.152
ZENOHELD: Time to say your goodbyes, young Brawlers.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.488
Every last living Bakugan is about to be

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.890
snuffed out for good!

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.935
DAN: Now that Zenoheld has all of the Attribute Energies

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.737
needed to power the BT System,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.939
it could be lights out for the Bakugan race.

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:15.841
In order to avoid that catastrophe we came up

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:18.043
with the idea of transporting them all to Earth.

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:20.712
Meanwhile, Drago and Helios went off to New Vestroia

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.748
on their own to try and destroy the BT System

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.683
using their own brute strength.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.485
But I'm not sure they're powerful enough to do it

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:29.054
without sacrificing themselves in the process.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.589
I'm telling you this is some pulse pounding,

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.358
heart stopping action like you've never seen before.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.760
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.094
Innnnn-tense!
