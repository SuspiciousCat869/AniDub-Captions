Unfortunately, it caused Bakugan Interspace to

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.789

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.072
PRINCE HYDRON: [screams]

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:56.843
PRINCE HYDRON: [panting]

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.478
VOLT: Time to fight back.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.913
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasp]

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.181
PRINCE HYDRON: Volt?

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:03.683
VOLT: You can't let him push you around anymore, Hydron.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.117
PRINCE HYDRON: [frightened breathing]

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.153
LYNC: He's right. After all you've done for your father

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.689
he should be honoring not tormenting you.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.090
PRINCE HYDRON: How did you...?

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.959
LYNC: Destroy him VOLT: Destroy him.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.827
LYNC: Take the throne, from him! VOLT: Take the throne, from him!

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.162
PRINCE HYDRON: Ahhhh!

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:19.665
LYNC/VOLT: Down with Zenoheld. All hail, Prince Hydron!

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:24.403
PRINCE HYDRON: [whimpering]

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.438
PRINCE HYDRON: [scream]

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:28.941
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasp]

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:37.817
[\u266a]

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.087
PRINCE HYDRON: Oh man. [gasps]

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:43.923
PRINCE HYDRON: It was just a dream.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.458
Why am I shaking?

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.161
PRINCE HYDRON: Come on now... Keep it together! [gasps]

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.863
PRINCE HYDRON: [grunt, exertion]

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:07.313
PRINCE HYDRON: I am a...force to be reckoned with.

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.648
A mighty warrior.

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.617
No one...not even he, scares me.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:15.054
PRINCE HYDRON: [exertion] I'll take him down.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.426
PRINCE HYDRON: Time for a shift in power. Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.631
ZENOHELD: I see you haven't learned your lesson, Hydron.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.235
PROFESSOR CLAY: The repairs on Farbros are now

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.337
complete, sire.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.471
PROFESSOR CLAY: And the data analysis to

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.340
synchronize it with \"the Alternative\" is proceeding

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:35.741
on schedule.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:38.010
ZENOHELD: Excellent...Soon enough I will take my

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.379
throne as Supreme Leader.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.248
PRINCE HYDRON: I wouldn't be so sure about that.

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:44.717
PROFESSOR CLAY: Huh? Who's there?

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.622
ZENOHELD: Unbelievable. So it's you again?

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.123
ZENOHELD: What is it now?

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.359
PRINCE HYDRON: Did I hear that Farbros is repaired?

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.927
PRINCE HYDRON: Fantastic timing.

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.829
What do you say, we take him for a spin.

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:58.397
Want to Dad ?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.832
ZENOHELD: Are you challenging me to a

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.200
battle, punk?

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:04.370
Haven't you had enough punishment for one day?

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.038
PRINCE HYDRON: You're not afraid are you?

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:09.508
If I really am the loser you accuse me of being

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.544
then I should be no trouble for you to beat.

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.913
Why don't you step up to the plate?

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:17.917
We'll see who's the better man.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.652
ZENOHELD: Professor Clay...

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.821
PROFESSOR CLAY: Yes sir!

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.560
ZENOHELD: I was never as proud and excited as I was

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.995
the day you were born.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.130
Unfortunately, you turned out to be nothing but a

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.865
disappointment to me.

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:36.636
You're an unworthy heir to my throne.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.037
PRINCE HYDRON: The failures in your life are

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.040
a result of your inability to lead.

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.943

PRINCE HYDRON: Not too bad, huh?

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.862
You should give me a little more credit for my skills, Father.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:41.300

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.244
Are you saving your good stuff for later?

PRINCE HYDRON: You're going to have to do better than that.

PRINCE HYDRON: Because I'll show you no mercy!

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:48.367
[\u266a]

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.737

PRINCE HYDRON: Oh big deal...

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:23.836
so Farbros is big and loud...but he's nothing

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:25.671
that I can't handle...

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:28.774

ZENOHELD: What?

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.414
PRINCE HYDRON: This ability allows Dryoid to travel

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:11.617
so fast that even Farbros' sensors can't detect him.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.422

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.688
dethroning you, huh father?

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.323
PRINCE HYDRON: Maybe it's time you started taking me

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.158
seriously as a battler and a man.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.627
ZENOHELD: What a joke.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.694
PRINCE HYDRON: Huh?

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:56.862
ZENOHELD: If you were truly serious about

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.298
wanting to succeed me, you wouldn't be so desperate

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.333
for my approval.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.502
ZENOHELD: You shouldn't care what I think of you...

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.070
PRINCE HYDRON: [gasp]

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:07.906
ZENOHELD: ...but you do. And that's why you won't succeed!

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:19.685
the humiliation on your face when you lose!

I have manipulated the gravitational pull.

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:58.076
PRINCE HYDRON: [angry growl] Curse... Curse...you...

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.379
PRINCE HYDRON: Come on, Dryoid! You can do it!

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.614
Use your strength.

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.451
ZENOHELD: Playtime is over with now.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.686
PRINCE HYDRON: [exertion]

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.688
PRINCE HYDRON: [exertion] [grunt]

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.623
Dryoid!

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:15.160
LYNC/VOLT: Down with Zenoheld. All hail Prince Hydron.

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:18.697
PRINCE HYDRON: [grunt] I know I can win this.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.600
ZENOHELD: Tell me, have you had enough yet, little boy?

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:27.039
PRINCE HYDRON: Enough! Be quiet. [grunt]

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.842
PRINCE HYDRON: Dryoid and I...

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.710
PRINCE HYDRON: ...will destroy you!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.213
ZENOHELD: Well, come on then.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.215
Let's have it.

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:37.716
PRINCE HYDRON: Come on now Dryoid!

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:42.554
Deliver us our victory do you me? Do you hear?

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:55.033
[\u266a]

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.768
ZENOHELD: Your attempt at courage is even more

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.138
pathetic than I could have imagined.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.906
ZENOHELD: Ability Activate!

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:03.475
Meteor Driver!

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:07.713
[\u266a]

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:08.747
PRINCE HYDRON: Why don't I introduce you to

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.682
my secret weapon?

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.117
Ability Card, Activate.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.553
GAUNTLET: Ability Card, set.

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:17.422
PRINCE HYDRON: Gaian Reflector! Hit it Dryoid!

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:28.000
[\u266a]

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.201
PRINCE HYDRON: This ability returns the opponent's

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:31.870
ability but with the power three times stronger!

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:33.105
ZENOHELD: It doesn't matter.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:38.877
Ability Activate! Shiny Orichalcum!

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.312
PRINCE HYDRON: What the...?

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:48.387
[\u266a]

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.024
PRINCE HYDRON: Ahhhhhhhhh!

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:57.763
GAUNTLET: Hydron Life force, zero.

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:02.634
PRINCE HYDRON: [grunt]

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.171
ZENOHELD: Perhaps now we can both admit the

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.541
truth...you and I were...never meant to be

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:12.711
father and son.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:22.054
PRINCE HYDRON: It's over...I lost...it all.

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:34.299
PRINCE HYDRON: You blew it! You fool. You lost everything!

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.401
VOLT: Why are you sitting here?

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.570
LYNC: You need to take down Zenoheld.

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:39.972
LYNC: And take his throne.

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.106
VOLT: Right now.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:44.876
PRINCE HYDRON: Go away. Leave me alone. Get lost!

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.879
PRINCE HYDRON: [grunt, anger]

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:52.384
PRINCE HYDRON: This isn't over, do you understand me?

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:56.855
PRINCE HYDRON: I will destroy Zenoheld.

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.529
GUS: Hmmph.

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.801
KEITH: I've never been very good with being patient.

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.470
Which is why I decided that rather than wait for

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.905
Zenoheld to complete the Alternative, I'll just

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.508
storm his palace instead.

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:19.478
I'll have Helios with me so I'll have plenty of back up.

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.647
KEITH: Besides, any chance I get to battle that old

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.849
fool Zenoheld, is a good thing.

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:27.085
I still owe him some payback for what he did to Gus.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.388
KEITH: Maybe you should tune in to see me wipe the

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.690
palace floor with him.

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:34.092
DAN: Wait for me Keith! Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.361
KEITH: Oh that Kuso loves a fight.

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:46.438
[\u266a]

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:56.081
