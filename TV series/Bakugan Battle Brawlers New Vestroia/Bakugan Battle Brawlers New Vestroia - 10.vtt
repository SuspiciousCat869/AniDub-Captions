WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.509
Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.644
So we joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.645
Resistance.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.482
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.918
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.488
Every battle makes us stronger and brings us

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.790
closer to our goal.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.925
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.028
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.196
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.232
We're ready to roll...

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.035
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:45.111
[\u266a]

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:54.754
[\u266a]

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.007
According to this, Beta City is on the other side of the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.008
mountains.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.178
Baron, adjust course for rough terrain.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.279
You got it, Ace.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.583
I thought you guys might be thirsty.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.419
Thanks, buddy.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.955
Alright!

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.392
Next stop Beta City and their Dimension Controller!

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.526
Like it, Dan?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.728
It's wheat germ puree.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.831
Hey, watch the instrument panel.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:40.433
It doesn't need a bath.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.969
Sorry about that...

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.473
Shun, you ever noticed that Mira sounds just like Runo?

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.774
Kinda...

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.846
Check it out, Runo!

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.848
I got another postcard from Billy.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.051
It says...

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.219
Wowie!

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.653
Billy's moved on to Africa.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.591
He's been building schools, and digging wells...

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.559
Are you even listening Runo?

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.695
That's it!

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:11.297
I'm going to New Vestroia to find Dan!

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.171
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: \"Surprise Visitor.\"

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.746
I have had enough of this, Spectra!

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.449
First of all, you still have not delivered the Dragonoid

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.117
to me.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.486
Sire... There have been difficulties.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.554
[slightly crazy breathing]

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.788
And now a Dimension

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.990
Controller has been destroyed.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.758
It's all because of that human, Dan,

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.560
and the Resistance...

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.296
[slightly crazy breathing]

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.064
It's so simple...

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.800
Get rid of the human and the Dragonoid will be mine.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.870
Get it done... Spectra.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.541
How long have you been thinking about this?

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.043
Since forever, 'kay?

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.678
Okay.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.180
How come you didn't want to talk to me about it?

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.616
[closed-mouth, annoyed growling]

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.887
You're not really...

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.023
serious about going, are you?

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.591
Yup, I am.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.393
But how will you get there?

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.162
Stop asking... questions!

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.067
Just let me do the talking, okay?

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.704
Well, well, well...

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.740
This is an unexpected surprise...

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.510
Is there something I can do for you, young ladies?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.678
Yes Kato.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.547
You can take us to Dr. Michael's lab in Moscow.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.050
Moscow?

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.285
Weeeee-hee-hee-hee!

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.654
Thank you so much, Kato!

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.456
My pleasure, Miss Runo.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.558
Anything for a friend of Master Marucho.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:49.462
I will connect you now with Miss Alice in Moscow.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.632
Alice, it's so good to see you !

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:55.068
Julie! Runo! What a surprise!

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:58.504
Are Dan and the rest of the team with you guys too?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.874
No.... It's just us...

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.110
And we really need Dr. Michael's help.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:07.647
My grandfather?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.115
... You see...

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:13.086
Dan and Marucho went to New Vestroia with Drago...

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.191
Finally.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.525
I have finished the repairs to the Dimension

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.827
Transporter.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.329
Now to test it and see if it works...

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:25.565
Grandfather!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.899
[running panting]

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.701
What is it, my child?

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.103
It's Dan...

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:33.473
He and Marucho have gone to New Vestroia to help Drago.

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:35.642
There's some kind of trouble there.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.477
When did this happen, Alice?

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.014
I... I'm not sure grandfather, Runo says that Drago told

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:44.851
them that aliens had captured all the Bakugan.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:48.354
Aliens... So that's what happened...

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.223
What, Grandfather?

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.992
The Dimension Gate between our world and New Vestroia

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:55.228
wasn't supposed to open again.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:58.231
But I've noticed recently that it's become very

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.732
unstable...

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.734
An alien invasion would explain that.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:06.105
Let's just hope I've managed to fix the Transporter.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.841
I hope Dan, Marucho and the Bakugan are going to be

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.576
alright.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.646
First we'll test it with this doll.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.049
Alice, I'll need your help.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.494
[nervous breathing]

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.904
Set coordinates.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.489
The gate should be opening...

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.357
It should be opening right now.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.859
[fearful gasp]

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:16.275
Still not working.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.011
They're here.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:30.456
[\u266a]

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:37.096
[\u266a]

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.564
Runo! Julie! Alice!

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.799
Alice!

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:49.108
[happy laughter]

00:06:49.142 --> 00:07:01.888
[\u266a]

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.157
A Gate Card?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.226
So you see, I've got to get to New Vestroia!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.294
It isn't safe.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.163
The Transporter isn't fixed yet.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:13.599
If it wasn't powerful enough to transport this doll,

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:16.569
it certainly won't be powerful enough for you.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.037
Oh please...

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.505
This is so important.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.073
Can't we give it a try?

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.241
My dear...

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.077
with the dimension gate so unstable...

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.280
if Runo got caught between two worlds,

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:29.148
I don't know if I could bring her home...

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:32.251
Then she would be lost...for eternity!

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.720
But...

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.657
I'd be willing to take that chance.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.392
Oh, Runo, don't be silly.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.993
Let's have dinner and catch up.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.662
Then we'll get a good night's sleep...

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.530
Tomorrow morning we'll figure something out,

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.200
I promise.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.201
Sure...

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.202
Sounds good.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.603
Interesting.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.072
I've never seen this Gate Card before.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.274
You say it fell from the sky?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.643
Yes, and there were others.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:07:59.245
Just as I suspected.

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:01.013
What is happening?

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:04.083
This card probably came from the human world.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.985
But why are they here?

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:08.788
On Earth energy can transform into Gate Cards.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:12.124
Someone from the human world must be trying to pass

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.293
through the Gate to New Vestroia.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.395
Then we'll welcome them.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:19.632
And surprise Dan Kuso while we're at it.

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.801
[happy giggles]

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:25.271
So Julie, now you're working at Runo's family's caf\u00e9?

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:26.405
Yeah!

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.275
Runo's dad says that business has increased 50

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.410
per cent since I started.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.578
Must be...

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.780
my sparkling personality.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:35.781
Riiiight!

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.183
Dream on, Julie!

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:43.789
[good-natured laugh]

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.462
Oh Runo...

00:08:50.630 --> 00:09:00.039
[light snoring]

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.440
You know, Runo,

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.209
this reminds me of the time when I used to work in your

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.510
caf\u00e9....

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:11.717
Oh yeah? Don't worry about Dan.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.219
He'll be fine.

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:14.787
I'm not worried...

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.689
Everything is perfectly fine.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.558
It couldn't be better.

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:24.397
[suppressed crying]

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.432
I'm sorry...

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:29.168
I know this is hard for you.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.306
[concerned sigh]

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:39.312
[\u266a]

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.080
[gobbling]

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.882
Guys!

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:46.819
Do you really have to make so much noise when you eat?

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.021
Runo used to say that too.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.356
Who's Runo?

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.258
I know that name...

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.361
Runo is one of the six original Bakugan Brawlers...

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:58.030
Am I right, Master Dan?

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.598
Riiiight...

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.233
You miss her?

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.935
[choking and sputtering]

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.036
You sound jealous.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.872
I just like to know where I stand...

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.140
She's your girlfriend?

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.542
No, she's not!

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.577
That's not what I heard from Runo...

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.013
Marucho!

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.882
She's not?

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.018
Nooo sheee's not!

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.721
I don't know where you guys get these ideas...

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.123
Right Shun?

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.324
She's not?

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:38.671
Runo, this is nuts.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.840
How are we going to get into the lab?

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.275
Easy...

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.678
I unlocked the window yesterday, before we left.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.348
I don't have a good feeling about this.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:52.685
Dr. Michael said the Transporter is still broken.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.820
What if we can't get it to work?

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.355
It'll work.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.790
But Dr. Michael said...

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.458
Forget Dr. Michael.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.793
I'm going!

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.661
I've made up my mind, Julie...

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.364
I can't just wait around for them to come back.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.967
That's why you're gonna zap me to New Vestroia.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.201
Got it?

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.970
[\u266a]

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:11.971
Hang tight.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.739
We'll be right back, Brawlers!

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.375
[\u266a]

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.543
Things are heating up...

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.211
Get ready to Brawl!

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.249
Let's crank this baby up.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.918
New Vestroia, here I come!

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.919
Okay, okay!

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.154
Hang on a sec!

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.856
I'm trying to figure out how this thing works.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.160
[nervous/worried]

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.533
You look like an \"ON\" button.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.714
Okay then... Step Two.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.650
Activate blue thingamabob.

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:03.122
Then I turn this doohickie...

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.825
And press the thingie.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.361
Whoa...

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.364
And then I push the Transporter button...

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:16.869
But...I ...

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.673
Go! Punch it!

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.308
Come on, Julie!

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:24.076
Quiet, Runo...

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.112
All right, already!

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:27.313
I'm up!

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:29.048
What's with all the noise, Dan?

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.617
It's the middle of the night.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.887
Runo, I don't think this is safe.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.555
Julie?

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.257
I'll take that risk.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.559
Now just hit the switch!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.094
It's coming from everywhere.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.596
Is that Runo?

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:46.465
But what if I read the instructions wrong?

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.967
You could get hurt.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.401
That's Julie's voice.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.836
This is too creepy.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.172
What's.... What's going on?

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.976
I thought I was dreaming but it's real.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.345
Stop talking and let's have lift-off!

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.213
I could have been there already!

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.282
What is that voice?

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:04.583
Perhaps it's...

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.652
a residual effect of the weakening dimensional

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:09.588
barrier, like the gate cards earlier.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.658
The wall between the Earth and New Vestroia is damaged.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.793
We're hearing voices from the human world.

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.629
I don't know.

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.331
Maybe we should stop this while we still can, Runo.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.934
That is one annoying voice.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.636
Don't bail on me, Julie!

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:25.571
Dan needs my help.

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:27.373
Friends of that human?

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:28.507
Julie!

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.309
But Runo!

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.045
Julie, stop!

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:34.680
Have you girls lost your minds?

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.382
It's now or never!

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:39.451
Julie, you mustn't!

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.320
I need to help Dan.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:42.855
Pleeeese!

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:43.989
Okay, Runo.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:50.162
[frightened scream]

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.837
Runo?

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.439
She's gone, Alice.

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:02.274
You mean, it worked?

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.514
Am I going crazy, guys?

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:09.882
Dan!

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.818
Runo!

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.286
No way!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.155
That's Runo?

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.291
Runo?

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.926
You never give up, do you?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.261
You doofus!

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:25.364
Why'd you ditch us?

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.974
Julie, do you remember the co-ordinates you used?

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.242
Uuuuuummmm...

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.409
No...

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:40.012
The transport is incomplete.

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.213
Are you sure?

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.282
Then how come Runo disappeared?

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.352
According to these readings Runo was transported...

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:50.322
But she's trapped between here and New Vestroia.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:53.292
We have to find a way to save her before it's too late.

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.761
Once the dimensional gateway closes completely,

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:59.498
I'm afraid she'll be lost between worlds forever.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.334
I think it would be best...

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:05.571
If we made sure this friend of Dan Kuso stayed trapped

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.206
in the dimensional gap for good.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:12.211
Who is closest to the gate's location?

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:15.581
I am.. oh great and powerful majesty!

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:17.149
[sarcastic laugh]

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.450
Shadow!

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.353
Keep the Brawlers away from the girl and I may forgive...

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:23.188
your disrespect.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.226
Well... At least I finally got to see you, Dan....

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.333
We're not giving up!

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:36.502
Dr. Michael, can you hear me?

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:37.703
How do we save her?

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:43.309
Dan! Is that you?

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.344
It's me, Doc! I'm here!

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:46.879
I'm sending you co-ordinates.

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.947
Take Runo there immediately!

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.683
You've got it!

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.217
Come on, Runo!

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.186
Right.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:55.587
Destiny awaits.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.655
Yes sir!

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.263
Hmmm. Spectra and Gus just left too...

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:07.066
My lord Hydron.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.535
The gate is due west of that mountain.

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.270
That's it!

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:15.074
Then let's go, before the Gate closes.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.076
Okay then...

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.410
Let's do this.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.582
How did you get to New Vestroia?

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.484
I mean, in one piece?

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:26.552
Sorry...

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.253
I'm glad you're here with him, Shun.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.023
Me too, Runo.

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:35.661
[\u266a]

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:37.663
Step on it, Runo! We can make it!

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:39.598
I'm hurrying!

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.134
Sorry... Dan...

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.602
I came to help you out...

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.305
But I just...

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.841
made everything worse!

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:50.609
No worries, Runo...

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:52.811
I shouldn't have ditched you guys in the first place.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.646
It's all my fault.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.116
No! I told Dan to leave you behind.

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.484
My apologies.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:01.353
And they all hugged and lived happily ever after...

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:02.988
Not!

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.256
Sorry kiddies.

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.524
This ride is closed.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.526
Shadow Prove, get out of my way!

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.527
[cocky laugh]

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.096
Who's gonna make me move, scrawny?

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.831
[goofy, mocking laugh]

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:15.200
Dan, wait!

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:18.904
Just get Runo to the gate.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:21.140
I'll take care of Shadow.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:24.743
You don't have time to waste on a dude in fur and tights.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.811
You're the best, pal.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.112
I know. Now go!

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.989
Gauntlet activated.

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:39.591
Gauntlet Power Strike!

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.260
Gate Card...

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.795
Set!

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.933
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:51.236
Darkus Silfee... Stand!

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.539
[wary gasp]

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.278
[battle roar]

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.180
Ready to roll, Elfin?

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.949
You better believe it, Marucho!

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.751
Bakugan Brawl!

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.386
Elfin Stand!

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.625
Sun, wind and rain combine!

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.496
Let Aquos Elfin...

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.630
Appear!

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.699
You're in trouble, now!

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:22.801
Hey, where are you going? I'm talking to you!

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.603
Get down!

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.305
[attack roar]

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:29.274
[wild cackle]

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.442
Howdya like that?

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.945
Silfee can attack anything inside the battlefield,

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:35.481
including Dan and whiney girl.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:36.615
That's cheating!

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:38.150
Bakugan aren't supposed to be used against their

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:40.052
human Brawlers!

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:42.721
Powering up the gauntlets turned all our Bakugan back

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.156
to ball form!

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.624
They're helpless!

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:47.392
Pretty clever...

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:50.929
Who knew Shadow had a brain underneath all that hair gel?

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.031
Hurts to lose, doesn't it?

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.667
Silfee, let's turn up the heat!

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.808
[startled scream]

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:06.712
Dan?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.149
Dan?

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:13.185
Elfin! We've got to protect Dan and Runo!

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.386
You got it!

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:15.554
I'm ready to pulverize!

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:18.190
I can't believe those cheaters totally ignored me!

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.260
Count me in!

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.794
Percival!

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.296
Hold it, Ace.

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.199
Summoning another Bakugan might be dangerous.

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.901
What do you mean?

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:31.537
The dimensional gate is already unstable.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.871
Too much extra power could...

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.706
destroy it!

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.874
...This bites!

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:43.448
I've dreamed about the world beyond that gate, Nemus.

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:47.886
Reality seldom matches our dreams, Baron.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.921
I guess you're right.

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:50.255
Just thinking...

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.790
Are, you okay, Dan?

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:54.660
Don't worry about me... Get to the gate!

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.495
Hurry, it's starting to close!

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.597
I'll find you again!

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.166
Prince Hydron is afraid of Earth.

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:03.235
But I'm intrigued.

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:06.238
There's no guarantee we'll be able to return...

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.373
You don't have to come with me, you know.

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:10.342
Oh, I'm coming too.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.579
Where you go, I go, Master Spectra.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.782
Dan?

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.250
Go on...Just go!

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.824
Lync?

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.459
Perhaps I'm wrong...

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:29.928
But I don't recall Prince Hydron commanding us to go

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:32.497
to the human world, great Spectra.

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.833
Which begs the question, why are you here?

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.169
Who knows what kind of trouble you'd get into if I

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:39.404
left the two of you alone?

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:40.472
Do what you like.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.707
We're going through!

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.347
Got to stop them...

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.848
Let's go!

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.119
Looks like we're going on a trip, Nemus!

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.888
I'm coming, Runo!

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.391
This is a bad idea!

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.427
Wait for me!

00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:04.463
Wahooooo!

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.401
Hi, it's Runo!

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.836
Worst trip ever!

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:13.272
We're finally back on Earth but we picked up unexpected

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.008
guests: Spectra and the Vexos!

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.176
I'm sure Marucho has his hands full brawling that

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.980
seriously dorky Shadow Prove back on New Vestroia.

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.182
But I know he's got what it takes to keep the Bakugan

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.085
Battle Brawler's Resistance alive.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:29.187
At least until we can find a way back to help save our

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:30.822
Bakugan friends!

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:33.792
And Spectra's got his own plan; kidnapping me!

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.327
It's soooo on!

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:46.405
[\u266a]

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:56.048
