WEBVTT

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.610
DAN: They came out of nowhere, launching a sneak attack.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.646
Before we knew it, the Vestal people had conquered

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.150
New Vestroia and captured all the Bakugan.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.320
But nobody messes with our friends!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.422
So Drago and I teamed up with Mira,

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.158
leader of the Bakugan Battle Brawler Resistance

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.960
to battle the Vexos.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.428
They weren't so tough.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.097
Drago and I took them down, no sweat...

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.466
And we're just getting started!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.568
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.676
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.978
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.713
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.181
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.050
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.420
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.223
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.059
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.697
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.500
MIRA: We should leave before they come back

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.502
with reinforcements.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.371
Well? Climb on.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.508
As if!

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.576
The way you drive?

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.079
Oh, well, if you're scared you can just walk.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.181
Well?

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.583
HYDRON: Intriguing...

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.851
So you're sure you've found the last

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.920
of the six fighting Bakugan?

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.121
SPECTRA: Yes.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.856
It seems that the beast has joined forces

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.892
with the Bakugan Brawler Resistance.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.661
That's good...

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.995
I'd hate to take him down...

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.264
without a fight.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:42.302
Crush the Resistance and bring the dragonoid to me.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:47.907
[\u266a]

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.510
I want to complete my collection.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:59.085
[\u266a]

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.357
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in...

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.665
JULIE: Have no fear, Julie's here to take your order!

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.367
MAN: How about an orange soda?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.302
MAN: No! Take my order first, Julie!

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.504
JULIE: Don't fight guys...

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.472
I'll get to all of you!

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.108
Whoa!

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.444
Stop playing around and take some orders!

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.146
Unlike some people...

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.516
I know how to have fun and work at the same time.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.885
[SCREAMING]

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.653
I know how to have fun!

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.288
Oh yeah... you're a laugh riot!

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.524
I'll fight anyone who says I'm not fun!

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.796
Thank you... Sorry about the bruises...

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.865
Is it safe to come out yet?

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.900
Hey look!

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.701
I just got a postcard from Billy.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.803
Really? How's he doing?

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.772
He's traveling the world to learn from the greatest

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.607
athletes he can find...

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.476
He's in Spain right now.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.879
[laughs]

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.115
Ole!

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.451
Whoa!

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.454
JULIE: I bet he's an awesome bullfighter.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.689
RUNO: Awesome?

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.224
Riiiiight.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.326
Ole...

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.062
Oh right...

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.264
You haven't heard from Dan lately have you?

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.099
Who cares about Dan?

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.669
If he wants to ditch us and run off with Drago...

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.305
Well that's fine by me...

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.510
Just be careful, Dan.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.645
[Dan sneezes]

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.147
If you're going to sneeze...

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.649
Try not to do it on my jacket.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:40.587
Actually... It's all over me.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.323
[laughs] Sorry buddy.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.024
Hey Mira.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.426
Aren't you a Vestal

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.027
just like those Lync and Volt dudes?

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.898
I may be a Vestal but I'm not like them.

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.635
So that's why you lead the Bakugan Brawler Resistance?

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.936
Sort of...

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.838
It's a long story but I guess it's important

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.408
for you to know exactly what happened.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:07.447
You might not believe it but one day Bakugan cards fell

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.383
from the sky, as if by magic.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:14.053
And from them came the Bakugan themselves.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.728
The same thing happened to us!

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.096
MIRA: Yes.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.565
When Dr. Michaels' dimension transporter malfunctioned

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.966
it created a rift.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.335
MARUCHO: Looks like you were connected to Vestroia

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.004
just like we were.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.572
Our world was too crowded.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.574
So when our King discovered New Vestroia,

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.109
he conquered the planet and colonized it

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:39.679
with our overflowing population.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.582
Once the invasion was over we built Bakugan Battle Arenas

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.484
in our cities.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.687
We were eager to play with our powerful, new \"pets\".

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.591
[crowd cheering]

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.092
[roar]

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:05.138

ANNOUNCER: And the winner is...

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.546
Spectraaaaa!

[cheering]

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.982
MIRA: Everyone went crazy

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:17.817
for the thrilling Bakugan Battles.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.852
Tickets sold like wildfire.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.388
You couldn't get one now if you tried.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.423
DRAGO: Hmmph...

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.091
You treat us like circus animals.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.759
The Bakugan were living in peace

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.528
when you Vestals attacked.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.330
Now they're enslaved and forced to battle

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.497
for the amusement

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.732
of the Vestal people.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.767
How can you be so cruel?

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.438
We didn't know.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.606
The people have never been told

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.142
the Bakugan are intelligent creatures.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:45.178
So your people think the Bakugan

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.513
are like pets who do tricks for them?

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.681
Yes...

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.884
And so did I until the day I discovered the truth.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.395
You guys wouldn't want to keep me out would you?

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:05.164
You're Professor Clay's daughter!

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.899
Sorry, ma'am!

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:07.900
Hang on...

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.836
I'll get Professor Clay on the line.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.371
Please don't.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.772
I want to surprise him.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.340
That's okay, right?

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:16.809
Oh sure! Fine by us!

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.211
She's so cooool.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.815
Whoa! what was that?

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.986
Mira, wait!

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.824
[loud roar]

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.393
Father, what are you doing here?

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.262
I'm going to have to ask you to leave, Miss Mira...

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.797
This way...

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.365
Hey! Hey!

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:49.142
Can't you keep him quiet?

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.680
[loud roar]

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:57.383
[\u266a]

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.218
Do your worst, destroyer.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.254
We will never give!

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.789
That Bakugan...

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.657
It spoke!

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.627
MIRA: It's not right, Father.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.163
You said we were colonizing an uninhabited world

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.932
but that's not true.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.234
We're the invaders, aren't we?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.771
Well, aren't you going to say anything?

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.342
This is not your concern, Mira.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.811
Father!

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.513
My father didn't even care.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:28.815
But I did.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.149
I was alone.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.585
But someone needed to help the Bakugan.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.886
Now.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.454
So I got together with people

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.356
who felt the same way I did.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.559
We started the Bakugan Brawler Resistance

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.794
and we've been fighting to free your Bakugan friends

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.496
ever since.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:46.065
But the Vexos champions are strong.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.067
Volt Luster is their top Haos brawler.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.004
Gus Grav is a weasel, but a powerful Subterra Brawler.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:55.074
Mylene Farrow is the leading Aquos Brawler.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.275
She's devious.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.978
You've met Lync Volan, the top Ventos Brawler.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.513
He'll do anything to win.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.015
Shadow Prove is the top Darkus Brawler.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.650
He's brutal and cruel.

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.220
And the most deadly of all, Spectra Phantom,

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.788
number one Pyrus Brawler.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:12.658
The six Vexos are champions of all six Bakugan attributes...

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.126
They're stronger than us.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.695
It must be hard to fight...

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.597
your own people.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.398
I'm glad to hear there is honour

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.033
among some of the Vestals.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.735
That means a lot...

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.503
Coming from you...

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.771
We're almost there!

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.039
DAN AND RUNO: Where?

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.274
Straight ahead!

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:29.609
Whoa!

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.910
So cool!

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.881
DAN: Stay tuned for more Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.219
DAN: Welcome back to Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.160
Welcome back! [laughs]

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.363
Look out! Whoa!

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.466
Hello Baron...

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:56.469
Let me introduce you to our guests.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.337
The masters!

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.805
M-m-masters?

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.540
I think he fell on his head.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.142
I know exactly who you are.

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.578
Dan Kuso and Marucho Marukura.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.346
Bakugan Brawling Masters!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.615
I'm Baron at your service!

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.018
Uh, hi Baron...

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.920
Pleased to meet you, I think.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:18.824
The pleasure is all mine!

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:24.263
I've never seen anyone so happy.

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.832
And you must be Master Drago!

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.868
That's me.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.569
I can't believe I embarrassed myself

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.271
in front of the greatest Bakugan in the universe!

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.140
You'll have to excuse Baron.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.741
He's one of your biggest fans.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.743
He knows all about how you saved Vestroia

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.345
and created New Vestroia.

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.581
He even has a poster of you up on his bedroom wall.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.083
Sorry about that.

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.218
I guess I got carried away.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.653
DAN: It's cool, man.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.455
We get recognized all the time.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.691
[angered growl]

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.559
Stick around and I'll show you

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.361
some of my battle strategy.

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.129
I think I'm might faint!

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.130
Great.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.433
Like Dan's ego wasn't big enough before...

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.001
Some things never change.

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:04.270
So where is Ace?

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:07.006
He said he had something to take care of.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.407
Up here!

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:10.776
MIRA: Ace!

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.011
Sooo sorry.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:15.715
I didn't mean to interrupt your bragging.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:16.849
What's your problem?

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:18.150
Get it together, Ace.

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:19.552
We've got company.

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.420
Yeah, smarten up.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.622
Do you have any idea who these people are?

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.691
And they can go back where they came from.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.627
We don't need their help.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.261
We'll free the Bakugan alone.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.298
Ace.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.766
ACE: You disappoint me, Mira.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.068
I thought you were a true Vestal warrior.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.137
That you were gonna make a difference.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.972
Now you invite a couple of Earth Dweebs

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.174
to join the Resistance?

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.044
You're just a star struck fan girl!

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:46.345
Watch it!

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:50.082
We won't walk away if the Bakugan need us.

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.684
Well said.

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:52.885
Too bad...

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.987
We don't need any of your help to rescue

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.689
all of the captured Bakugan.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:59.025
This is none of your business so take your friend

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.259
and go home!

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:02.995
No, Ace.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:06.665
To free the Bakugan we need all the help we can get.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.902
We don't have time for one of your ego trips.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.405
Just humour me...

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.507
The human should prove himself.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:23.883
What do you say \"master\"?

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.017
Come on.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:26.752
Beat Percival and you can join

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:30.423
the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.490
Whoa.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.525
Drago!

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:33.993
I'm up for it.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.361
Okay, Ace...

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.530
We'll take you on!

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:45.304
Why are those two battling each other?

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.807
They're on the same side.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.011
I guess they just have to get it out of their system.

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.613
Yeah, before they destroy each other.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:58.317
Now remember this, when the Bakugan Brawler Resistance

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.252
battle the Vexos, we're not just playing

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.620
at childish games...

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:04.457
We're fighting to free the Bakugan.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.326
In order to get the stolen Bakugan back,

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.462
our power has to be at least 500 points

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.230
higher than our opponents'.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.901
DAN: So that's why the Vexos' Bakugan returned to me

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.770
when I won.

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:20.139
So if I win, I take your Drago...

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.507
agreed?

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.742
That's fine by me as long as I get your Percival

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.544
when I beat you.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.847
Are you scared?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.115
Dream on.

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.484
There's no way that's gonna happen.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.853
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet activated.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.354
BOTH: Gauntlet... Power Strike!

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:40.559
Gate card... set!

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.732
Now let's see what you've got, oh great master!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.001
Just don't say I didn't warn you.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.035
You ready?

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.972
Always!

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:55.474
BOTH: Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:01.280
BOTH: Bakugan Stand!

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:08.787
[\u266a]

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.956
[scream]

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.958
Drago!

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:15.561
Lucky shot.

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.899
This isn't going to be much of a contest.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.568
Look how high my power level is already.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.073
It's my turn.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.042
Gate card Set!

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.981
BOTH: Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.816
What do they think they're doing?

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.418
If they shoot at the same time,

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:43.055
then Drago will lose because his power level is lower!

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.326
DAN: Bakugan Stand!

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:48.894
Drago!

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.396
ACE: Bakugan Stand!

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:51.730
Percival!

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:54.300
Whoa, did you catch that curve?

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.469
Dan must have put some spin on the ball when he shot it.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.605
Pretty proud of yourself, huh?

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:00.839
[laughs]

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:02.007
Laugh it up...

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.409
I'm just getting started!

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:04.810
GAUNTLET: Ability card, set.

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.445
ACE: Ability Activate!

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.547
Darkus Driver!

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:21.860
Not so fast!

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.262
Ability Activate!

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.531
Burning Dragon!

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.206
What happened?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.841
GAUNTLET: Power level increase.

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:36.942
Snap!

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.677
His power's still higher than mine!

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.380
Dan, a little help please?

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.148
Okay! Gate Card open!

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.784
Pyrus Reactor!

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:51.390
GAUNTLET: Power level increase.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:52.625
Ha!

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.896
Not finished yet!

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.064
Clever but not clever enough...

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.199
Let's go!

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.767
Ability Activate!

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.102
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.604
ACE: Tri-Gunner!

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:13.912
[roar]

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.384
GAUNTLET: Power level increase.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.685
Get ready...

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:20.886
Drago!

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.055
Ability Activate!

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.890
Burning Dragon!

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:27.593
[roar]

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.869
That's the third and final attack!

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:39.038
Their powers are even.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.205
Think again.

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.975
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:44.843
Pyrus Slayer!

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.680
GAUNTLET: Drago power level increase.

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:48.747
No way!

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.183
He used a combination Fusion Ability?

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.918
I'll crush that!

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.753
Ability Activate!

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.922
Night Explorer!

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.458
GAUNTLET: Power level decrease.

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:02.628
No! It's not enough!

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.641
Now we're even.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.044
How long can they keep this up?

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:21.547
They're evenly matched so it's anyone's guess.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.848
Watch out...

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.350
Neither one is going to give in

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:28.354
so they could end up obliterating each other.

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.589
Gate Card Set!

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:36.395
Let's finish this, Percival.

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.430
Once and for all!

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.632
I'll show you power!

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:45.003
Are you ready to kick some Bakugan, Drago?

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.373
You can count on me, Dan!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.942
Okay! Let's do it!

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.643
Bakugan Brawl!

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:03.589
Now!

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.830
Percival!

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:16.235
Dragoooo!

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:20.072
[roar]

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.123
GAUNTLET: Power levels equal.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:57.476
How long can they keep this up?

00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:58.944
Unbelievable!

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:01.980
Those two have been battling for over three hours.

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:04.249
This has gone too far.

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:05.617
Come on...

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.586
Bet you've had enough, haven't you?

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.054
Just give up!

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.155
Huh!

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:13.826
I'm just getting started!

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.128
Ready for another rumble?

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:17.563
Let's do it!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.367
Let's finish them off.

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.802
You bet.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.671
Bakugan...

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:26.972
Braaaaawwwl!

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:30.809
[screaming]

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.180
Dan! Ace!

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:44.790
[\u266a]

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.725
[groaning]

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:54.566
[laughing]

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.934
Man, you're off the rim!

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.337
Ha! And you're not?

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.239
You fought well, Percival.

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:03.108
We'll settle this another time, Drago.

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:05.277
After we get some rest.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.080
[laughter]

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.886
Looks like we have two new members.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:21.026
DAN: Dimension Controller? What's that?

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.830
There are three Dimensions: Alpha, Beta and Gamma...

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:28.100
Their power changed the Bakugan back into balls.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.035
If we were to destroy those controllers,

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.370
would that change the Bakugan

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.539
back to their former selves?

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.107
It's worth trying.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.876
Battling Vexos will only get us so far...

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.313
We need to hit them where it really, really hurts...

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:44.516
That's why we've gotta wipe out all three Controllers.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.251
But Each of the Dimension Controllers

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:48.520
is in the center of a city.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.423
So...

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.792
That means we have to hit the enemy in his lair.

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.861
What do you think Dan?

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:03.201
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.503
[loud gulp]

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.271
Sounds like my kind of mission!

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.273
Now that's the stuff.

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:09.374
I'm in!

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:12.110
Gotta love a guy who doesn't over think things.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:13.845
Brace yourself everyone.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.480
We're taking off!

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:17.716
What's going on around here?

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:18.884
An earthquake?

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.759
Next stop, Alpha!

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.895
DAN: No way! This building is on the move?

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.296
MARUCHO: Do all the buildings move?

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.398
Must make it hard for the mailman to find your address.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.499
Relax.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.468
The base turns into a tank.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.537
This is off the chain.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.439
I think you'll like our technology.

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:43.976
Even someone as slow as Dan can operate it!

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.011
Alright!

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:48.647
This just keeps getting better and better!

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.783
Right Marucho! Some kind of hero you are!

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.652
Whoooaah! Let me down! I'm afraid of heights!

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.954
I mean it, Dan. I might drool on you!

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.656
Seriously, I'm getting airsick!

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.959
THINKING: Dan and Marucho are always there for each other.

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.264
Like brothers.

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.769
We're going... Vexos hunting!

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:14.239
with my heroes Master Dan and Master Marucho!

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.841
Those Vexos don't stand a chance

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.943
against Dan and Drago.

00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:19.678
But that doesn't stop Shadow Prove

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.747
from trying to take us down.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.782
I'm pretty sure I can take him.

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.517
Then again, maybe not.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.852
He's pretty tough.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.353
Check out \"Get Psyched!\"

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:32.357
next time on Bakugan Battle Brawlers New Vestroia!

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:35.761
You don't want to miss this!

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.895
Bakugan Brawl!
