WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.242
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.845
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with him

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.180
the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.217
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.252
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.688
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.423
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.092
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.861
DAN: Their energies were caused the Bakugan

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.930
to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.565
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.800
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.335
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.138
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.541
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.476
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.711
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.479
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:47.881
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.783
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.151
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.219
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.555
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.893
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.862
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.030
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:13.106
[\u266a]

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.975
ELICO AND VULCAN: [Screaming]

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.677
BRONTES: What are you doing to them Gus?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.745
Stop it!

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.079
We've always been loyal Bakugan.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.015
What did we do to deserve this?

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.750
GUS: Quit your whimpering, Brontes...

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.785
You are one of our soldiers now.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.354
We have no tolerance for weakness or cowardice...

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.989
You really should be thanking me

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.892
after your Master tossed you away like worthless trash.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.893
BRONTES: [gasp]

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.961
GUS: When this is over...

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.262
even you'll be amazed with the results.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.897
Now be quiet and hold still.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.566
This may sting a little.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.740
BRONTES: [screams] Gus! Please!

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.776
Make it stop!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.552
SPECTRA: Don't they know struggling just makes it worse?

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.522
BRONTES: Make it stop.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.931
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Spectra Rises.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.466
SPECTRA: Chaos Ability X.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.301
With this card we can force the evolution of any

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.103
Bakugan in our possession...

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.706
making them our battle weapons.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.841
GUS: It's brilliant, sir.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.610
SPECTRA: Helios is growing quite nicely into his new

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.478
battle armour.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.013
He's on his way to becoming the most powerful

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.349
Bakugan that has ever lived.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.783
He will be the instrument that I will use to crush

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.552
those who tried to destroy me...

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.786
All that's left is...

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.822
...to capture the Perfect Core Energy from Drago.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.024
GUS: That will mean another visit...

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.692
with my old friend Dan Kuso.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.094
SPECTRA: Correct.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.262
SPECTRA: I have a feeling...

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.130
we will also be seeing some of our old Vexos

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.299
teammates in the next little while, Gus.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.333
GUS: What?!

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.768
SPECTRA: When the Resistance defeated the

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.603
Vestals and destroyed Vespalace, King Zenoheld

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.539
and the Royal family managed to escape

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.073
and go into hiding.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.775
GUS: Well what about the Vexos?

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.177
Did they go with him?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.411
SPECTRA: Of course they did...

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.380
Who else would do Zenoheld's bidding?

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.415
I don't imagine he's going to sit in exile for long,

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.650
though...

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.019
I'd be willing to bet my entire stable of Bakugan,

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.621
that he's got his eyes on the same prize as us...

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.823
Too bad for him, we're going to beat him

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.425
to the punch this time...

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.861
I wonder who will be more surprised by our attack.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.729
Zenoheld or the Battle Brawlers?

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.206
DAN, MARUCHO AND MIRA: [grunt]

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.377
BARON: Master Marucho!

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.546
Master Dan! Mira! You made it!

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.315
DAN: Hey guys. What's happenin'?

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.150
MARUCHO: Hey! Where's the red carpet?

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.351
MIRA: Wow guys.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.552
This place is amazing.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:40.687
If I didn't know better, I'd think we were still

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.754
at Marucho's house.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.789
ACE: Are you kidding me?

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.224
Even Marucho's dog house is bigger than this.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.859
MIRA: Hah, you're probably right, Ace.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.728
MIRA: But seriously, it's like a fairytale...

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.264
it's a magical palace you'd see in a story book.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.366
KLAUS: If this is a magical palace, then it is

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.134
greatly in need of a princess.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.235
MIRA: Huh?

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.837
KLAUS: Are you interested in the position?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.272
Princess Mira?

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.107
Why yes, that does have a nice ring to it...

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.476
Greetings, I am Klaus Von Herzen...

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.011
Welcome to my home.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.412
KLAUS: [smooch]

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.413
ACE: Dude!

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.048
MIRA: Um... hi there.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.483
DAN: This guy is cheesy.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.884
Why do girls always fall for it?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.920
MARUCHO: Oh please, you wish you were that smooth.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.388
DRAGO: Can we get down to business?

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.389
DAN: Huh?

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.824
Oh yeah, you're right.

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.626
Why don't you guys fill us in the Vexos attacks.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.660
MIRA: Dan's right...

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.794
they're probably out there right now plotting

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.129
their next move.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.667
SHADOW PROVE: This is what happens when you send a boy

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.402
to do a man's job.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.671
Ha Ha!

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.172
He gets beaten by an Emo ninja...

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:34.507
... and an overgrown peacock!

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.942
Embarrassing!

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.378
PRINCE HYDRON: Hey, hey. Why the sad faces kiddies?

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.512
Oh, that's right...

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.015
... you failed against the Battle Brawlers again.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:45.318
Honestly guys, do I have to do everything around here?

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.853
LYNC: You got something to say, Hydron?

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.788
MYLENE: Lync! Leave it alone.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.089
LYNC: [grunting]

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.393
PRINCE HYDRON: Where was that fire when you were battling?

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.963
SHADOW PROVE: Hah!

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.231
You think you're a tough guy 'cause you beat

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.532
a newbie like Baron?

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.434
Listen Hydron, why don't you and the rest of the

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.404
ladies sit back and watch a real master at work.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.172
Maybe you'll all learn a thing or two.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.508
Time for Daddy to go out and bring home the bacon.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.842
Yeaaaaaaahhhh!

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.944
VOLT: Sit down.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.379
VOLT: I'm going next.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.251
MIRA: Well, luckily for us the Vexos have only

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.586
managed to take the Haos Energy so far.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.021
WILDA: That we know of for certain.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.456
Who knows what's happened to Shun and Ingram since

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.325
they left for New Vestroia.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.426
DRAGO: That's a good point...

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.094
If only we had some way of contacting them

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.562
to find out for sure.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.663
ELFIN: Oh, no.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:31.798
Do you think they're alright?

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.932
I really hope they are!

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.400
DAN: Forget this waiting around business, man.

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.601
It's making me crazy...

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.137
Let's attack them in their secret hideout!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.338
ACE: Secret hideout...

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.373
good idea.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.342
Any idea where that might be, genius?

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.776
BARON: Guys.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.446
How do they keep getting the drop on us...

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.414
It's like they magically appear out of thin air.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.483
Without any warning.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.684
MIRA: The Mother Palace...

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.019
They're probably transporting themselves

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.187
from there.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.455
That means they're hiding out somewhere in this

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:56.522
dimensional universe.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.857
MARUCHO: Klaus, can we reconfigure your

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.258
trans-dimensional communications system

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.861
to identify and track dimensional anomalies?

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:03.896
If so we could use is to locate their point

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.265
of origin and find out where they're hiding.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.402
KLAUS: Unfortunately, I don't think that will be possible.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:10.536
ELFIN: Why?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.871
I thought your foundation was at the cutting edge

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.306
of technology!

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.640
SIRENOID: That's like asking us to re-tool your

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.376
microwave so you can cut your lawn with it.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.944
Just because they're both pieces of machinery

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.746
doesn't mean they can be used for the same purpose.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.314
DAN: Enough...

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.715
I'm not gonna just sit here and wait for the

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.183
Vexos to attack!

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.651
DRAGO: Dan...

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.653
Huh?

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:28.721
KLAUS: Well Dan...

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.956
it looks like you're not going to have to wait

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.125
after all.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.164
DAN, MIRA, MARUCHO, ACE, BARON, KLAUS: [grunting]

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.402
DAN: Volt?

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.571
VOLT: Pyrus, Subterra, Darkus, Aquos.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.773
Well, well.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.441
Looks like all the attributes I have on my list

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.143
are right here in front of me.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:53.746
VOLT: There's nothing I love more than one stop shopping,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.582
especially when it comes to attributes.

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.650
DAN: Hah!

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.018
If you think you've actually got a chance of

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.319
beating all of us by yourself, then you're even

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.121
sillier than that haircut makes you look.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.689
SPECTRA: Insulting a man's hair?

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.591
That's just downright impolite.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:08.361
SPECTRA: Hello Dan Kuso.

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.996
DAN: Spectra!

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.899
VOLT: You're still alive?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.267
DAN: [shocked]

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.068
SPECTRA: That's right... Relax.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.570
You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.906
I promise you I'm flesh and blood, Volt.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:21.874
I know you must be overcome with happiness,

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.777
especially you fled the crumbling palace

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:27.413
and left me for dead.

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.048
SPECTRA: I hate to spoil your plans...

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:30.349
... but I've got some business to settle

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.617
with Dan, here.

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.152
DAN: Spectra.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.520
SPECTRA: That's right!

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:35.888
I beat you once, Dan...

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.857
and I'll have no problem doing it again.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.592
VOLT: Hey, not so fast Spectra.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.561
This is my battle... get in line.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.962
ACE: They're fighting?

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.530
What's up with that?

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:45.598
BARON: I dunno.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.867
I thought they were on the same side.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.235
SPECTRA: Anyone who gets in my way will be an enemy,

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.504
whether they're Brawlers or Vexos.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.740
Either way, I will crush them and leave them in the dust.

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.976
VOLT: I won't let you bully me, Spectra.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.177
GUS: Really?

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.212
He just did.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.813
GUS: You talk a big game, Volt,

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.081
but when it comes down to it...

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:05.017
you're a disloyal coward.

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:07.086
VOLT: What? Is that...?

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.087
Brontes!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.388
Where did you find him?

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:10.823
Why is he with you?

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.360
Why do you have Brontes?! Answer me!

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.162
VOLT: Gus!

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.197
What did you do to my Brontes?

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.699
GUS: Your Brontes?

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:21.000
That's very funny Volt...

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.468
Why do you care so much about something that you

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.437
so easily tossed away?

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.873
I've modified him to better suit my purposes.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:27.940
VOLT: [shocked ]

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.742
What do you mean, \"modified\"?

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:30.877
GUS: Well...

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.511
I don't want to sound dramatic, but I guess

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.146
in a way you could say...

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.948
I took away his soul.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.651
VOLT: [grunting] Brontes.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:39.919
GUS: Ha.

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.420
SPECTRA: Dan...

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.555
are you ready to have some fun?

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.056
DAN: Bring it on, frosted tips!

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.057
MIRA: Dan!

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.125
I want in on this too.

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:47.193
DAN: Really?

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.394
MARUCHO: That goes double for me, Dan!

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.495
DAN: Are you sure?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.997
[gasp]

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.064
ACE: Hey guys!

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:53.299
Hold on a second!

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.400
SPECTRA, MIRA, DAN AND MARUCHO: Gauntlet Power Strike!

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.507
DAN: Spectra's gonna face a real triple threat!

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.642
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.347
SPECTRA: Being back from the dead has never felt so good.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.983
DAN: Gate Card, Set!

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.818
DAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:15.187
Pyrus Cross Drago!

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:29.735
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.570
SPECTRA: Drago... you've grown up.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.941
You're still no match for what I'm about to unleash...

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:38.077
I call Helios MK-2.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.712
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:41.814
Helios stand!

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:53.492
HELIOS: [evil growl erupts into roar]

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.927
DAN: What the... ?

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.395
MIRA: Helios has evolved too!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.298
DRAGO: Helios. You've changed.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.833
HELIOS: Don't think you're special just because you

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.970
were gifted an attribute energy by the ancients.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.771
DRAGO: But your evolution wasn't natural.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.206
There's something wrong.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.908
HELIOS: There is nothing wrong with me.

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.209
I assure you...

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.844
I'm just as powerful as you...

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:14.146
IF NOT MORE!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.881
DRAGO: He's gone mad.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.984
SPECTRA: No more talk!

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.652
Ability activate!

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.487
Defuse Quasar!

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.057
HELIOS: [roar]

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:27.893
DAN: Hah!

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.295
Ability activate!

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.263
Superior Shield!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.298
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaahhhh!

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.335
SPECTRA: Not so fast, Brawler...

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.870
Ability activate.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:40.940

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.776
Fire Reflector!

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.811
DRAGO: [roar]

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.613
MIRA: Good call, Dan.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.115
He's deflecting Helios' attack!

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.716
MARUCHO: Drago's getting him back!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.052
DAN: Helios is messing with a whole new Drago

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:54.754
this battle!

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.789
HELIOS: Is that all you've got?

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.325
SPECTRA: Ability activate!

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:01.260

DRAGO: [pained cry]

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:11.037
DAN: Drago!

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.038
MIRA: Wow...

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.572
Helios really packs a punch.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:14.840
MARUCHO: Are you ready, Elfin?

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.409
ELFIN: I was born ready!

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:17.610
MARUCHO: That's what I like to hear.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:18.844
Hang on Dan.

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:20.246
Help is on the way.

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.214
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.383
ELFIN: Comprised of equal parts Sun, Wind and Rain

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:27.186
this Bakugan has got it all going on.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.388
Please put your hands together for the debut

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.524
of Aquos Elfin version 2!

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.928
DRAGO: Elfin!

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:37.063
ELFIN: Ohhhh, Drago!

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.364
The sound of your big, strong voice sends shivers

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.932
up and down my spine!

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.233

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.678
Nice one!

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.679
Thanks a lot!

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.080
DRAGO: Yes, nice save.

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:29.515

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:30.716
HELIOS: Hah!

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.218
Let's fight!

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.986

HELIOS: [roar]

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:45.364
MIRA: His attacks are so devastating.

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.500
MARUCHO: Mira! Tandem attack.

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.902

DAN: This Command Card rocks...

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.663
It immobilizes the opponent Bakugan as well

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.698
as blocks any new abilities to activate

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.567
which is just awesome.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.069
What do you think of that there Spectra?

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:25.337

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.324
SPECTRA: Alright!

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:48.394

I've never seen you back down from a fight so easily.

SPECTRA: Don't worry, Dan.

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.743
I'm not leaving for good.

Guess I'm a bit wobbly.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.464
DRAGO: Spectra and Helios both fought

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.533

You ready for your turn?

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.639
VOLT: There's nothing I'd love more than to crush you

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:43.108
and to take Drago's attribute energy...

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.744
but I won't kick a man when he's down.

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:46.979
MARUCHO: Wow!

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.447
Volt actually did the honourable thing.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.582
DAN: Looks like...

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:53.151
Spectra's his own boss now.

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:57.456
SPECTRA: His powers surpassed even those of my perfect Helios.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:00.158
You certainly keep life interesting, Dan Kuso.

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:04.863

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:15.607
Except I ain't looking for the three little pigs.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.110
SHADOW PROVE: I'm collecting Bakugan attributes.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.545
This will be like taking candy from a baby.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:23.215
Hey, looks like Alice has found a friend.

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:26.084
SHADOW PROVE: The one in red is acts pretty tough,

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.586
but I wonder if her Brawling is as strong

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.087
as her kung fu.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.789
SHADOW PROVE: You'll have to tune in to find out.

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:33.759
