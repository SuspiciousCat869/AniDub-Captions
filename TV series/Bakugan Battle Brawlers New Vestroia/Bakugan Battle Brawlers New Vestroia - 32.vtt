WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.309
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia, King

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.444
Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.247
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.949
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.317
Bakugan.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.985
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.688
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.323
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.159
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.128
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.697
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.499
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.800
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.435
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.104
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.541
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.778
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.613
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.014
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.749
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.184
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.219
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.954
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.826
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.829
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.130
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.606
SPECTRA: Now Gus...It's time.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.675
GUS: Yes sir...as you wish.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:20.079
SOLDIER: Launching broadcast jammer.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.687
FANS: [woots and revelry]

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.522
PEOPLE: Huh?

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.523
Who's that guy?

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.025
SPECTRA: Greetings citizens.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.561
I am Spectra...I'm sure many of you remember me as

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.663
the leader of the Vexos.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.971
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Shadow Attack

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.239
SPECTRA: It's true.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.508
I was the leader of the Vexos...

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.677
SPECTRA: ...but that is no longer so...

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.479
SPECTRA: ...Like you, I was deceived

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.646
by the Royal Family.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.616
SPECTRA: King Zenoheld and Prince Hydron are planning

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.886
to conquer all nations across every dimension.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.754
SPECTRA: When I learned of their plan to build a new

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:06.326
evil empire, I could no longer be part of the Vexos.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.096
SPECTRA: They branded me a traitor, but I don't care.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.265
ACE: Hah...can you believe the nerve of this guy

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.334
taking over the airwaves with his lies.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.469
DAN: Spectra's putting on a good performance.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.905
But I just know he's up to something rotten.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.173
MIRA: Keith, why?

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.242
SPECTRA: Vestal is in danger...from the evil

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.910
King Zenoheld.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:31.150
SPECTRA: Vestal is in danger...

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.652
ZENOHELD: Hmmph.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.621
PRINCE HYDRON: Why that filthy traitor!

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.724
How dare he try to jeopardize our mission like that.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.859
ZENOHELD: Let him babble to the Vestals if he wants...

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.428
no one will trust a former member of the Vexos.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.763
Much less a traitor.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.064
SHADOW PROVE: You forgot to mention loser and bad

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.900
dresser too, oh yeah!

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.835
MYLENE: Oh man...What a dweeb.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.903
SHADOW PROVE: Ooooooh!

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:50.904
Snap.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.106
He is a dweeb isn't...hang on.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.275
SHADOW PROVE: You're talking about me aren't you?

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.409
You should talk!

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.344
Who's the one who lost to a guy in a ruffled shirt?

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.680
SHADOW PROVE: I'll show that loud mouth Mylene.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:02.015
Let me go next.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.216
KING ZENOHELD: You've have much to learn in the way

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.684
of manners, but the others have been

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.586
disappointing...Very well...

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.188
You may go.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.656
SHADOW PROVE: Yeaaaaahhhh!

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.958
SHADOW PROVE: Watch the master at work!

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.027
SOLDIER A: The transporter has locked in on the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.328
destination coordinates.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:19.432
Begin power up in three, two, one...mark.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.267
Transporter is at full power.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.402
We are ready to go.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.870
SHADOW PROVE: Oh yeah!

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:29.242
SOLDIER A: Transport commencing, now!

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:36.282
SHADOW PROVE: That was awful quick...huh?

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.283
SHADOW PROVE: What happened?

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.551
You knuckleheads messed it up!

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.586
I'm still here!

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.254
How can you be so useless?

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:42.255
ZENOHELD: What's this?

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.790
Why did the transport fail?

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.191
This should have been easy.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.292
SOLDIER A: Yes, sir.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.695
Normally it would be, but it seems our transport

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.897
signal path to Vestal is being jammed by a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.366
transmission from the Vestal Destroyer.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.302
ZENOHELD: Spectra, no doubt...humphh...he's such

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.937
a thorn in my side.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.674
GUS: Our signal interference was

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.009
successful, sir.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.478
GUS: We've managed to block the Royal Palace

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.147
from transporting anyone aboard to Vestal.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.149
SPECTRA: Excellent news...

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.151
I can battle Dan without any interruptions from

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.420
Zenoheld or the Vexos.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.422
SPECTRA: I will be the one who defeats Drago...and

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.059
this time no one will get in my way.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.631
MIRA: I remember something Keith said to me...

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:27.767
SPECTRA: Once I create my Ultimate Bakugan Warrior,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.804
I will over throw the Royal Family and take Vestal.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.406
Anyone in my way will be destroyed.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.308
DAN: Yeah, but that was before we had the powers

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.843
of the Six Ancients.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.845
ACE: We beat him once...It sounds like he's turning

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:40.847
his attention to overthrowing Zenoheld

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.016
and the Vexos now.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.151
MIRA: Maybe but we can't be sure it all isn't part

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.855
of his larger plan...In the beginning, my brother

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.723
infiltrated the royal family because he

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.959
suspected that Zenoheld was lying to the people

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:56.929
of Vestal.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.498
MIRA: Once Keith learned the truth about the

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.100
Bakugan, something inside of him changed.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.503
He became obsessed with capturing the Perfect Core

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.139
Energy which he would use to create his Ultimate

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:08.941
Bakugan and then rule the world.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.309
MIRA: And with that...

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:13.179
MIRA: ...Spectra was born.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:14.814
DRAGO: So now we must be on guard for attacks from

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.149
two enemies.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.184
Zenoheld and the Vexos who are after the Pyrus Energy

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.819
Attribute.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.622
And now Spectra who wants the Perfect Core energy.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.656
ELFIN: Gee, Drago.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.058
You sure are Mr. Popular.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.726
DRAGO: There is no humour in this, Elfin.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.727
ELFIN: Oh...

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.728
DAN: Doesn't matter...

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.129
DAN: Anyone who challenges us is an enemy...

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.632
No matter what they're after, they're gonna have

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.067
to fight us to get it.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.301
DAN: Bad news for them is...

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.869
DAN: ...they're gonna lose.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.005
PRINCE HYDRON: Not being able to travel to Vexos is

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.306
a problem for us.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.607
PRINCE HYDRON: That's where the Brawlers with

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.909
the Attribute Energies are.

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:44.310
How are we supposed to take their powers now that

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:47.814
Spectra has blocked our path?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.184
ZENOHELD: Hmmm...there has to be a solution...Perhaps

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:53.886
if we can't go to Vestal to face the Brawlers then

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.022
we can have them come to us.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.624
MYLENE: But, they'll never come here.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.727
ZENOHELD: No, not here, Mylene...We'll take the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.295
battle to their home.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:04.764
MYLENE: Oh I see...we will lure the Brawlers off of

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.833
Vestal and back to Earth, right into our hands.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.602
ZENOHELD: This way we'll get the drop on the

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.104
Brawlers and leave that insolent fool, Spectra in

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.972
the dust.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.174
ZENOHELD: [laughter]

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.510
Shadow Prove, go!

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.120
ALICE: It's so peaceful here.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:30.289
HYDRA: Yes...at times I'm reminds me of my home on

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.291
New Vestroia.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.693
ALICE: Do you miss it?

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.361
HYDRA: Now and then.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.164
But I always feel at home with you, Alice.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.366
ALICE: I feel the same Hydranoid.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.804
DR. MICHAEL: Hmmm?

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:45.905
DR. MICHAEL: That's odd.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.440
The sensors are saying that a dimension gate has

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.308
opened nearby.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:50.409
DR. MICHAEL: But the Dimension Transporter

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.378
System isn't powered up at the moment.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.379
[gasp]

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.413
DR. MICHAEL: Oh No!

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.681
Someone must be transporting themselves

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.717
from another dimension using another system.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.152
Which means that...

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.620
DR. MICHAEL: They're Vexos!

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:01.754
DR. MICHAEL: I've got to warn Alice.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.656
She's in danger!

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.891
ALICE: [grunt/stretching reax]

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.159
I'm hungry.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.027
I wonder if Grandfather's back with lunch yet.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.429
SHADOW PROVE: Yeahhh.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:12.398
I'm hungry too, Alice.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.934
For battle that is.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.236
ALICE: I guess we should head back to the house and

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.638
set the table.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:19.639
SHADOW PROVE: [loud growl]

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:20.740
SHADOW PROVE: [growl]

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.341
Leaving so soon?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.110
What's the rush, little lady?

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.978
ALICE: Oh...hi there...

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.780
ALICE: Are you lost little doggie?

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:28.848
SHADOW PROVE: Little doggie?

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.016
I'm a werewolf!

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.417
ALICE: A werewolf with red nail polish?

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.718
SHADOW PROVE: What? Are you kidding me??

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.620
You should be terrified right now.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.088
ALICE: I'm really sorry.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.191
SHADOW PROVE: You'll be sorry alright.

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.326
After I take your Bakugan in Battle!

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.895
[laughter]

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.297
ALICE: Vexos!

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.598
....You're no werewolf.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:46.966
SHADOW PROVE: This wolf's about

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.467
to steal your picnic basket.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.702
[maniacal laughter]

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.539
ALICE: Shadow Prove wants to brawl,

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.107
I need your help, Hydranoid!

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.446
ALICE: [panting, exertion reax]

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:01.547
SHADOW PROVE: Hey, where you goin'?

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.182
We were just starting to have fun.

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.183
[howl]

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.918
HYDRA: Alice. Why are you running?

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:06.919
We can beat him in battle.

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:08.421
ALICE: Hydranoid, I can't...

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:09.488
HYDRA: Yes you can.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.357
You were given a Gauntlet by Mira.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.692
ALICE: [panting reax] Hydranoid, please, please.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.060
I can't go back there.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.528
I just can't.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.396
ALICE: I put my days of Battling behind me when I

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.999
laid my Masquerade identity to rest.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:22.668
ALICE: [panting]

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.838
ALICE: [sigh]

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.341
I think we finally lost him.

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.243
SHADOW PROVE: [Low growl] ALICE: Wait.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.945
Did you here something?

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.146
SHADOW PROVE: [another low growl]

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.214
ALICE: Did I imagine it?

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.749
ALICE: Maybe my ears are playing tricks on me.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:37.884
SHADOW PROVE: [growl]

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.852

SHADOW PROVE: [frightened reax]

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:44.790
SHADOW PROVE: Heeeyyy!

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.259
What's with scaring me like that?

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.828
Can we quit stalling at get to the battle,

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:49.829
already?

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.564

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.432
SHADOW PROVE: [slurp]

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.301
I can taste my victory already.

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.203
ALICE: [gasp, cowering reax]

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.838
SHADOW PROVE: [laughter]

00:08:58.871 --> 00:08:59.839
Hmmmm?

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:04.043
SHADOW PROVE: Ahhhh!

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.311
Not the kidneys!

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.646

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.481

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.749
CHAN: Hey Alice. What's up?

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:12.418
Klaus asked me to check in on you, so I brought this...

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.253
... just in case.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.588
ALICE: A Gauntlet?

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:16.589
SHADOW PROVE: [grunt]

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:18.991
Another Bakugan Brawler, eh?

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:22.261
Two for one...Today must be my lucky day.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.397
CHAN: Are you ready to do this, Alice?

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.499
ALICE: Uh...I don't know if I can.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:33.506
HYDRA: I need to even the score ...I cannot back

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.976

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.445

ALICE: Masquerade...

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.323

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.457
give in that...

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.125
ALICE: .... I might not come back.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.501
HYDRA: That's it Alice.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.470

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.238
SHADOW PROVE: Hah...let's go.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.640

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.442
GAUNTLET: Gauntlet, activate.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.743

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.572
HYDRA: So this is Hades...Ingram told me

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.141
about him...My imposter.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:44.477
HYDRA: I want to destroy him.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.212
ALICE: I understand...let's go.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:48.447

HYDRA: [mighty roar]

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:03.095
HYDRA: You're a pale imitation who's about

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.065
to feel the wrath of a true Hydra.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.066
SHADOW PROVE: Hah!

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.300

SHADOW PROVE: Looks like the original Hydranoid

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:37.630
isn't such a big deal after all.

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:40.032
Hades is better and stronger in every way...

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.601
but why keep talking about it, when I can show

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:45.304
you in painful detail again and again.

One should always laugh and take pleasure in their work.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:12.298
This is why, evil forces, it gives me great joy

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:15.734
to vanquish you with my mighty blades of fire!

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.573

same time.

00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:50.136
