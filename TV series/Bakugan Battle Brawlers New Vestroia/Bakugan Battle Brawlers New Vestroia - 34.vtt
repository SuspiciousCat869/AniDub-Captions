WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.242
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.811
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.280
with him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.384
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.219
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.755
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.456
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.226
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.328
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.764
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.532
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.700
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.435
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.641
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.610
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:44.878
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.646
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.047
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.816
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.251
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.319
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.521
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.059
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.962
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:03.997
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.074
[all grunting]

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.876
DAN: Whoa. Is...

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.877
this the place?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.878
MARUCHO: Yup.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.346
This is my rooftop rose garden.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.347
ACE: Yeah...

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.582
of course it is.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.317
KATO: Master Marucho, welcome home.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.053
KATO: Your friends have been anxiously awaiting

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.555
your arrival.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.490
RUNO: You're heeeeerrre!

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.692
JULIE: Welcome back guys!

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.827
DAN: Hey guys.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.428
Shun... you're back.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.097
BARON: Master Shun, are you okay?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.298
We were so worried.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.066
RUNO: Shun ran into Lync on New Vestroia and now

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.901
Alice has been attacked.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.269
DAN: Yeah, we heard.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.704
That's why we rushed back.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.940
SHUN: We should get inside and bring each other up to speed.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.942
DAN: Let's go.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.777
OPERATOR: King Zenoheld, sensors indicate a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.879
Dimensional Gate has opened on Earth.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:53.980
ZENOHELD: Hmmph.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.748
I see the Brawlers haven't wasted any time.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.816
Go Mylene.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.117
And don't come back empty handed.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.252
MYLENE: Yes sir.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.286
I won't fail you.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.421
LYNC: Neither will I...

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.455
The Brawlers are really gonna pay this time.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.428
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Earth Invaders

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.198
MARUCHO: It doesn't make any sense.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.000
We all know the Vexos are after the attribute

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.836
energies the Six Ancient Warriors gave us.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.371
SHUN: It's a trap, just like luring me to New

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.806
Vestroia was.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.374
BARON: But why bring us all the way back here when

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.409
they could have kept fighting us on Vestal?

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.512
MIRA: Maybe the Vexos changed their strategy

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.580
when Spectra showed up again...

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.616
It was pretty clear when we saw Spectra and Volt

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.385
during our last battle, that they aren't allies anymore.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.654
ACE: I wouldn't be surprised if Spectra had a hand in this.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.323
ACE: I can't see the Vexos going to the trouble of

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.792
Dimensional Transport unless they had no choice.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.661
MARUCHO: Maybe Spectra did something that forced them

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.763
to take the battle off of Vestal.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.398
DRAGO: Whatever the case, the fact remains that our

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.333
enemies have come to Earth.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.535
DAN: Drago's right.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.403
Sitting here playing guessing games isn't helping us.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.138
The Vexos are coming for us, so we've got to

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.540
prepare ourselves for some heavy duty battle

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.174
with those creeps.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.809
RUNO: Maybe we shouldn't be so gung-ho to fight them.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.511
I mean, what if we lose?

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.712
DAN: [shocked] What?

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.114
RUNO: They already have the Haos Energy, and they

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.282
came close to winning a couple others.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.550
MIRA: Runo's right.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:04.684
We have to be smart about this.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.885
If they capture all the energies...

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.287
SHUN: ...then the Bakugan Termination System will

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.855
become fully operational...

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.426
SHUN: ...and all of the Bakugan that we fought so

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.928
hard to free...

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.397
...will be completely wiped out...

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.831
forever.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.667
SHUN: I saw the horrible thing with my own eyes

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.403
when I was in New Vestroia.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.138
SHUN: It's only partially functional...

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.707
but it's still turning the Bakugan into balls.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.142
DRAGO: Oh no.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.443
ACE: I can't believe it.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.678
Just when they were finally free...

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.813
the Vexos better run when they see me coming.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.415
RUNO: And that goes double for me, Ace...

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.649
I'm so mad!

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:37.850
JULIE: Don't worry, Runo.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.252
We'll teach those Vexos a lesson.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.553
DAN: Uh...

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.689
does that mean you guys are actually planning on Brawling?

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.357
JULIE: Well, it makes perfect sense...

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.925
Since Runo and I don't have any attribute

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.227
energies to lose we should be your first line of defense.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.564
Then you guys can fight only when it's absolutely necessary.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.733
TIGRERRA: I am ready to fight, m'lady.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.468
GOREM: And I've got our back too!

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.170
WILLDA: No, it's far too dangerous.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.605
BARON: Listen to Willda.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.340
The Vexos are fighting with Mechanical Bakugan

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.808
and they're crazy powerful...

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.277
Not just any Bakugan can beat them.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.979
RUNO: Are you saying that my Tigrerra and Gorem

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.247
aren't good enough to fight along side of you?

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.248
JULIE: You better take that back, Baron!

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.249
Right now!

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.718
BARON: Easy guys, that's not what I meant.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.486
ACE: What Baron's saying is that we've already

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.555
fought the Mechanical Bakugan so we know what to expect.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.956
PERCIVAL: Trust us.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.324
Fighting one of them is serious business.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.592
RUNO: Oh yeah?

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.661
Well messing with us is serious business too, Percival!

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.830
ELFIN: But we evolved and have superior strength.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:25.231
PREYAS: So you're better than me?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.833
ELFIN: I was better than you even before that!

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.301
PREYAS: You evolved into a jerk!

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.303
SHUN: You know, Runo may just have a point...

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.605
Battling the Vexos is too risky for us now.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.308
MARUCHO: They'll be expecting us to come after them.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.677
Maybe it's time for us to switch strategies too...

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.912
We should hide out for a while and spend our time

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.581
planning a sneak attack.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.815
MIRA: Good idea...

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.218
we'll have the element of surprise on our side for once.

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.587
DAN: I dunno guys, it sounds to me like we'll be

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.155
a bunch of sitting ducks.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.424
BARON: Yeah guys, what happens if they find us?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.825
MARUCHO: Don't worry, everyone.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.027
Leave that to me.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.995
MARUCHO: I always plan for all possible scenarios,

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.297
so a while ago I found a way to create a barrier shield

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.366
using dimension wave technology.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.035
DAN: A barrier shield?

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.603
MARUCHO: It's kind of complicated to explain how

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.405
it works so it's best if you try and imagine it as

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.140
an invisibility cloak.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.475
As long as we stay in this house, the Vexos will

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.978
never be able to find us.

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.046
PREYAS: Nice one, Marucho!

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.414
ELFIN: You're such a smart cookie!

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.584
KATO: Sir... the button.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:19.619
MARUCHO: Okay...

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.988
time to disappear.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.938
MYLENE: This place is huge.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.873
Finding the Brawlers won't be easy.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.208
MYLENE: We should get started...

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.177
let's go.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.745
[beeping]

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.814
LYNC: Hmmm... Whah? Wait a second!

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.282
MYLENE: What now.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.983
LYNC: The Brawlers' signal just disappeared.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.218
MYLENE: What?

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.221
LYNC: [sigh] So now what?

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.989
MYLENE: We should split up Lync...

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.761
Maybe we'll have better luck picking up their signal again.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.362
MARUCHO: All systems are go!

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.631
Looks like the barrier shield is working.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.799
SHUN: Nice job...

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.302
now we sit back and try and wait the Vexos out.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.470
DAN: Uggggghhh...

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.038
exactly how long do we have to wait?

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:14.240
MARUCHO: I wouldn't be in a big rush to leave if I were you.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:15.575
Sorry, Dan.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:16.676
DAN: Huh?

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.411
ACE: Don't forget Spectra is after Drago's perfect

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.079
Core energy too Dan.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.748
BARON: That's right Master Dan.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.782
Don't forget...

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.617
if the Vexos followed us to Earth then Spectra

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.219
won't be far behind.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.954
MARUCHO: The Vexos and Spectra...

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.089
Each of those guys is tough enough to fight on

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.958
their own, but if you've got both of them coming at

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.292
you all at once...

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.861
You and Drago can't leave.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.330
DAN: Awww come on, man.

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:39.999
I came here to battle not bury my head in the sand.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:41.300
DRAGO: There will be plenty of time for battle

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:42.702
later, Dan.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.036
For now we wait.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.371
JULIE: Come on, Dan.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.106
Why the long face....We can have fun...

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.941
think of it as a big slumber party!

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.577
GOREM: Happy thoughts will help the time pass.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.912
DAN: Alright...

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.447
I guess if I had to be stuck somewhere there are

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.449
worse places than Marucho's house.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.717
JULIE: What'dya say, Dan.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.585
Wanna head down to the bowling alley with us?

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:00.920
RUNO: Let's go!

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.789
TIGRERRA: There's no point in fighting them, Dan.

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.490
DAN: Okay, I'm in.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:08.995
DAN: Hey... Mira, come with us.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.797
MIRA: Um... well... uhhh...

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.736
MIRA: These next few days are sure

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.906
gonna be interesting.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.475
PEOPLE: Wild Lines: - Wh is that woman?

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.710
- Why is she dressed so strangely?

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.846
- She's kind of scary looking.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.948
MYLENE: I knew we'd attract attention here.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.317
MYLENE: Hmmmm.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.586
PEOPLE: - Whoa, what is she wearing?

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.589
- Is that a...

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.592
no it can't be.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.628
- What an odd woman

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.201
MYLENE: I hope Lync was smart enough to know

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.503
he'd need a disguise too... huh?

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.505
LYNC: That'll be five dollars, please.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.207
Thanks...

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.742
Here's your change.

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:57.743
Thanks very much.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.579
Please come again.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.048
LYNC: We appreciate your business.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.051
Come out, come out wherever you are, Brawlers.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.019
FEMALE CUSTOMER: Excuse me, sir.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.955
LYNC: Yes, may I help you?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.089
FEMALE CUSTOMER: I'm looking for some flowers

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.257
to take to a dinner party.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.358
LYNC: Of course.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.193
How much were you looking to spend, ma'am?

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:17.730
MYLENE: What on Earth is he doing? Goofball.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.300
MYLENE: We're coming for you, Brawlers!

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.639
LYNC: You can run but you can't hide, Brawlers!

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.508
DAN: Man, I can't keep sitting around doing

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.943
nothing but eating.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.880
DAN: This waiting is driving me crazy.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.348
BARON: What's the plan Master Dan...

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.850
so are we gonna send Runo to battle the Vexos first,

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.151
or what?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:42.221
RUNO: [gasp] I don't believe you Dan Kuso!

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.556
DAN: Runo, please...

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.725
Don't blow this way out of proportion, okay?

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:46.993
It's just that-

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.561
RUNO: -you think I'm a lousy Brawler!

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:50.563
Boy, you got some nerve.

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.673
MIRA: Huh? Runo?

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.380
MYLENE: We're never going to find them this way?

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.115
[beeping]

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:12.919
VOLT: It's their signal.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.622
RUNO: I'll show Dan what a great Brawler I am... yup...

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.624
Those Vexos, they're not looking for me so they'll

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:20.192
never see me coming.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:26.532
RUNO: Hmm?

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.601
RUNO: This looks like a good short-cut.

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:33.706
MIRA: Runo!

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:34.941
MIRA: What are you doing out here?

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.042
It's dangerous.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.343
We should go.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.245
RUNO: But I need to prove to Dan that I'm just as

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:40.980
good a Brawler as the rest of you.

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.648
Don't worry, Mira it's not like Tigrerra has an

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.884
attribute energy to lose or anything.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.385
MIRA: Runo, you don't understand how serious

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.954
this is.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.222
If the Vexos ever found you here it'd be bad.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:54.760
LYNC: I spy with my little eye...

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.762
VOLT: ... something that starts with the letter M!

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:59.131

MIRA: They're Vexos!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.807
