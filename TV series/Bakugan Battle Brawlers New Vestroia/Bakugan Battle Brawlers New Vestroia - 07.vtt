WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.241
Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.442
to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.611
So we joined up with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.612
Resistance.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.048
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.818
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.254
Every battle makes us stronger and brings us

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.523
closer to our goal.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.291
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.460
Controllers to free the Bakugan!

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.263
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.865
We're ready to roll...

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.400
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:44.944
[\u266a]

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:54.587
[\u266a]

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:16.843
[\u266a]

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.413
Finally... there it is.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.582
Alpha City, New Vestroia!

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.284
Here we come!

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.285
Okay...

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.319
Follow me.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:32.392
This duct goes underground and comes up inside the city.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.696
This way we can sneak into the city undetected.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.331
[effort sigh]

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.133
How did you find this, Shun?

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.836
I've been casing the area for a couple of days.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.304
Nice work, Man.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.939
Great to have you on the team.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.073
Let's go!

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:51.177
[\u266a]

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.214
Wow! That's seriously awesome ninja action...

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.715
Now it's my turn...

00:01:55.748 --> 00:02:00.253
[various \"martial arts shouts\"]

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:05.692
I don't think he has the ninja thing down quite yet.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.760
Uh, don't you think we should follow them?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.130
Yeah!

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.465
This rocks!

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:21.541
[\u266a]

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:25.345
I can't pass up this chance to talk to my father.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.983
But I'll have to give them the slip to do that.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.687
You... you seem troubled, Mira.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.089
I'm fine.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.124
Well, I'm right beside you.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.492
Thanks a lot.

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.194
[\u266a]

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.064
[\u266a]

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:48.434
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Cyber Nightmare\"!

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.304
[effort]

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.940
Man, I never thought we'd get here.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:54.974
[frightened yell]...

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.242
What the?

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.644
oh no!

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.747
Battle of the Bakugan!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.149
Many will compete but only one will rise victorious!

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.450
[awed gasp]

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.620
You won't want to miss a minute of the action.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:10.089
See you there, Brawlers!

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.094
[frightened yell] [frightened yell]...

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.429
[frightened yell]

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.635
[panting]

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.837
Whoa! Looks like we got here in the middle of rush hour.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.806
How about a little warning next time...

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.107
Shun.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.242
Sorry, dude...

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.410
Check it out.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.978
Wow... Awesome.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.347
This is where I used to live.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.450
My father still works here.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.852
It's not what I was expecting.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.888
I know what you mean, Dan.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.526
I thought a city full of Vestals would look more

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.261
evil-like, you know?

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.496
Yeah, but everyone looks like us.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.365
It doesn't make sense...

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.702
How come they don't understand about the Bakugan?

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.037
Battle of the Bakugan!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:02.208
The world's top brawlers in the ultimate smackdown!

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.643
Cool! Can't wait!

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.345
It's gonna be the best...

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:07.680
But no one can take on Spectra.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.915
No way!

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.783
My brother's gonna crush them all.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.085
Whoa! He's a brawler?

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.121
Yeah, he's gonna win for sure, this time.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.657
And then he'll become a member of the Vexos!

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.992
Sweet...

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.861
When I grow up I want to join the Vexos too.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.364
I want to be just like Spectra.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.033
I'm gonna be just like Shadow!

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.201
I guess...

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.236
the Vexos are their heroes.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.437
It's weird...

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.574
I don't want to blame them for getting excited.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.543
But everyone needs to learn the truth.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:41.481
Bakugan are intelligent beings who deserve to be free.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:43.716
Remember. It's not their fault...

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.953
I was the same until I found out.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.789
[extreme pain scream]

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:56.029
Oh darn! I lost again.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.363
[indulgent chuckle]

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.866
You're just not following through, Mira.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.468
You corner your opponent but for some reason you lose

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.537
focus on the final attack.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.140
Well... I just want to beat my big brother...

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.141
So there!

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.175
Just chill.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.210
You're learning fast, Short Stuff!

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.546
[good natured giggle]

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.184
[good natured chuckle]

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.587
Oh Keith...

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.289
This is whacked.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.857
We've got to make them understand...

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.860
Bakugan are alive, feel pain and should be set free!

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.195
That's right...

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.365
We'll tell the Vestals the whole truth and then they'll see...

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.067
Good plan, Elfin?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.468
Sure, sure.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.303
But maybe just to be on the safe side,

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.706
we should destroy the Controller first.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.074
Yeah.... Yeah...

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.075
I'm with her.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.210
Where is the Controller?

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.345
Over there.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.549
The dome in the center of the city is the Battle Arena

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.218
where all the Bakugan tournaments take place.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.021
And that tower on the top is the Dimension Controller.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.491
What are we waiting for?

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:00.026
Let's get to work...

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.561
Come on, Shun.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.296
Hold on...

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.498
I want to check out the Controller first guys.

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:06.799
Have you lost it?

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:10.103
That Controller has got to be destroyed right now.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.238
Just give me a minute...

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.440
I want to try something.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.909
You should give Shun a chance, Dan...

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.879
After all, he got us into the city, didn't he?

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:20.947
Whatever...

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.181
Let's just get going!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.583
No! I can't join you.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:27.186
There's something I have to take care of... alone.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.321
What the...

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.323
Mira! Stop!

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.691
Weird.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.600
It was foolish to think he'd be here.

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.303
Mira. You're back.

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:47.206
You're still doing homework?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.409
Mira... Check this out.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.544
What is it?

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.346
Another lame video?

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.781
Or a secret love note?

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.149
Here.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.284
Hey thanks ... sis.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:14.200
Everything is just the way he left it.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.974
There must be some clue here.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.776
Something to tell me where he's gone.

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:30.716
I know...

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.352
if I just keep looking...

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:41.227
It's just... I feel like something is wrong.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.831
I hope he's out there fighting to free the Bakugan like me.

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.332
What do you think, Wilda?

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.467
Does that make any sense to you?

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.502
Well...

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.770
I...

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.805
Wilda?

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.740
Who's there?

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.209
Mira...

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.777
You've come back.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.345
Father!

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:00.646
Well I'm glad...

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.215
you have come to your senses.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.316
Never!

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.618
If it means enslaving the Bakugan!

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.088
No need to get so upset, Mira.... Why can't you just

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.256
enjoy your good life?

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.557
No way...

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:15.161
That life depends upon the misery of others.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.196
...Enough.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.765
Father, where is Keith?

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.101
Tell me! You know something...

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.570
don't you?

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.411
Mira, your brother... He is no more.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.381
Please take my advice...

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:38.050
And just forget that you ever knew him...

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.353
Monster... How could you?

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:45.558
[phone ringing]

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.126
Yes?

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.861
I'm on my way.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.331
Hold it!

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.066
Are you saying something happened?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.101
Tell me!

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:58.237
Pull yourself together!

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.472
Mira...

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:02.675
This is all that I have to say on the matter.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.176
If you know what's good for you...

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.648
you will clean up and learn to behave ... Lock up when

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.350
you leave.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.286
Father...

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:17.623
Come back! I swear I'll find the truth...

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.126
We'll be back in a flash. Right, Mira?

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.160
Right!

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.098
Let the Brawling... begin!

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.172
You're sure the Trans System has reached the projected numbers?

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.240
Yes sir.

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.775
... See? Checks out.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:36.976
Excellent work.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.045
We'll begin the experiment... immediately.

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.579
BOTH: Yes sir!

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.461
THINKING: What are you up to this time, Father?

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.868
Now where'd they go?

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.244
[high-pitched, sonic squeal]

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.713
[surprised gasp]

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.823
W-What is that thing?

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.024
Trans System active...

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.159
energy level steady at 2500.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:36.736
[angry squeal/roar]

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:38.637
Raise it to 3000.

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.673
What? All at once?

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.274
There are strict guidelines.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.577
We're on the threshold of something great...

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.112
Increase power!

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.080
Yes sir! Increasing power.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.857
[pained moan/squeal]

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:07.933
[\u266a]

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:16.308
[\u266a]

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.046
[thrilled, slightly maniacal laugh]

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.782
It worked! We did it!

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:26.452
The power of a Bakugan...

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.554
In a cybernetic body...

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:31.957
We've created a new Bakugan!

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.726
It can't be...

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.295
Vestals creating Bakugan?

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:38.164
But why, Father? Why?

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.605
DAN: Man, security here is tighter than Shun's jeans.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.278
We won't even get close with all those guards around.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.946
Wait! Look over there, Master Dan!

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:55.047
Huh?

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:56.515
It looks like they're doing a mock battle

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.417
before the tournament starts.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.019
Where? Where?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.788
Ah! There they are!

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:05.591
[bird cry]

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:09.695
You see that?

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:12.131
Just what I thought.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:14.066
The Battle Arena and the Dimension Controller

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.602
seem to be synchronized.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.070
Synchronized?

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:22.007
So this is what you wanted to check out, Shun?

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.075
Yeah...

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:24.677
We'll take advantage of that link to destroy

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.046
the Dimension Controller.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.448
Let's get out of here first and then I'll explain.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:31.951
Maybe we should wait until Mira gets back.

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:34.553
I can't believe she ditched us like that...

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.056
Mira! Yo Mira!

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.290
Come in.

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.758
Dan...

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:40.926
Please keep it down.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.128
Keep it down?

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.295
We've got Bakugan to save...

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:44.597
Remember?

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.532
Things are a lot worse than you think...

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:47.933
Get here fast.

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:50.069
What? Are you all right?

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.104
Just tell us where you are!

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.039
Scored us a ride!

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.341
Come on!

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.076
Follow our friend's signal and hurry!

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.544
Welcome to Happy Cab!

00:12:58.577 --> 00:12:59.879
We're kind of in a hurry...

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:04.283
So step on it.... Is there a \"Go\" button around here?

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.351
Oboy!

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:07.453
Fasten your seatbelts, that's the rocket boost!

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.193
Woo hoo!

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.529
I feel the need for speed!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.903
I can't believe it...

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.905
This is like a nightmare...

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.007
[recoil from sudden glare]

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.308
[cocky/mocking laugh]

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.177
...Lync!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.246
You thought you were so smart coming here... Mira.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.383
Your father's a genius, you know...

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:41.754
But it's too bad for you that you didn't inherit his brain...

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:44.023
We've been following you ever since you went home

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.891
and you never even noticed.

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:48.928
Amateur...

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.062
Dumb moves like that

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.097
are why your little crusade is doomed ...

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.632
But I'll help you out.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.635
You'd like to see what your father's been up to here,

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.271
wouldn't you Mira?

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:02.675
Well take a good, long look.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.945
Good news; a new day is dawning for the Vexos...

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.080
And I'm gonna show you why.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.416

[dismissive laugh] Just in time...

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.321
Now you can lose in front of an audience, Mira.

Go Ventus Altair!

What is that thing?

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:10.776
I've never seen anything like it.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.711
It's a cybernetic Bakugan...

Oh don't act so surprised...

Vestal science can do anything...

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:29.128
And Altair is living proof!

Wait Dan!

This is my mess to clean up.

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:44.209
But Mira...

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.512
That's an order, Dan...

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:47.780
I have to do this.

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:49.181
Maybe she's right Dan.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.582
It's her father who did this.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.551
Keep it in the family, right?

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:53.719
Understand?

I need you Wilda...

Never fear Mira...

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:05.384
Its energy endurance is failing.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.886
The booster system can't handle it...

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.823
Double Ability drains too much power.

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:14.226
It's causing an energy feedback to three systems.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.528
You, increase server capacity...

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.130
Raise it thirty percent!

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.698
Raising levels.

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:22.734
MIRA: Anyone know what's going on?

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.603
No... but we should hit him now.

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:27.673
He's right. Time to pull Altair's plug!

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:28.974
Baron's right, Mira!

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.142
Do it!

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:32.110
Ability Activate...

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.345
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:36.215
Now... Apollon Head, go!

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:39.651
Let's show this fake what a real Bakugan Trap can do!

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:43.622
[frustrated, pained squeal/feedback]

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.624
MARUCHO: Baliton's got him now!

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.863
Okay, you've had your fun.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.130
Time for...

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.266
...Another Double ability!

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:55.734
Another Double ability?

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.436
That kid is wild!

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.670
Professor!

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:03.008
No. This will yield important data Do it, Lync!

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.244
Destroy them both!

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.112
MIRA: Father?

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.347
Spinal Saucer...

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.682
Plus thunder Fire!

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.688
Look at that Power Level!

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:18.223
Incredible!

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:22.561
[\u266a]

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.162
Snap! This looks bad!

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.898
Mira... Get down!

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:26.965
Wilda!

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.033
Too late!

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.768
Shock 'em Altair!

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:33.805
[extreme pain squeal/roar]

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.075
[\u266a]

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.544
Hey! What the..!

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:47.386
[defeated squeal/roar]

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.959
The Booster system overloaded.

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:56.395
Everything's shutting down.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.531
That's it then...

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.968
Shut down all systems immediately.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.203
Done Sir.

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.273
That's it?

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.442
It turned back into ball form.

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:13.779
[sigh] Oh well...

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:15.180
Big deal...

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:18.116
It's just another broken Bakugan...

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.284
You got lucky.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:20.552
You don't even care?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.820
Why?

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.489
Soon Professor Clay will perfect it.

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:25.691
[gasp]

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:26.825
So don't sweat it.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.727
I'll finish this off the next time we get together.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.596
See ya later, los-e-nator!

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.598
DAN: Take your broken toy and go home!

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:33.932
[gasp]

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.734
MIRA: Father!

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:38.704
What's wrong with you?

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:43.242
THINKING: How could you care more about a Cyber Bakugan

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.544
than your own daughter?

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:51.149
Professor, here is the data from the battle.

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:52.918
[appraising grunt]

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:55.554
THINKING: Once I make the modifications on Altair,

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.756
based on this data, he will be the most powerful

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:00.626
Bakugan in the universe!

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.062
[evil chuckle to laugh]

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:09.501
Hey, this is Ace.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:10.736
You know that Shun?

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:11.903
Well, I don't like him.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.472
Too quiet for my taste.

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:16.608
But now, in order to destroy the Dimension Controller,

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:20.078
I have to team up with him for the Bakugan Battle Tournament.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:23.248
But when things get nuts, I don't know who to battle;

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.418
the opposing team or this Ninja-wannabe who's supposed

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.487
to my brawling partner?

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.889
Get a front row seat, next time

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:34.559
on Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.294
See you there, Brawlers!
