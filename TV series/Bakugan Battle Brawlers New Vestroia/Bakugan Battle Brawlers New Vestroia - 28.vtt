WEBVTT

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.295
Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:11.493
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought with

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:14.325
him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.191
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:19.090
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.788
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.754
But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and transferred

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:25.953
their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.252
Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:30.584
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:32.583
The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands and the

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:33.783
stakes are high.

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:35.415
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:45.477
[\u266a]

00:00:45.477 --> 00:00:55.106
[\u266a]

00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:12.698
Those blasted Ancients may think they've foiled me

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.330
with their little trick but they are sadly mistaken.

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:20.493
They have done nothing more than prolong the inevitable.

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:23.759
The Six Attribute Energies that I require to power

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.457
the Bakugan Termination System will be mine.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.022
They may have defeated me on New Vestroia, but the

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.288
Bakugan and their Brawlers, will not stand

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.987
in the way of my latest conquest.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.119
I promise you that.

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:40.117
King Zenoheld, it seems most logical that the

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:42.783
Bakugan Resistance are the ones whom the Ancients

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.982
entrusted their powers to.

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.847
Given that the Resistance is comprised of both

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.113
Vestals and Earthlings, this would have allowed

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:51.545
them to hide their energies in two different, distant

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.611
locations, making them more difficult for us to find.

00:01:54.644 --> 00:01:56.543
What and interesting theory, Mylene.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:58.275
Well done.

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:01.007
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.973
Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.005
crush them under my heel.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.072
Yes sir.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.305
I want you to start with a trip to Vestal.

00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:10.836
Since the Vestals were once my subjects, their

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.368
traitorous actions should be punished.

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:14.834
Of course, sir.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.234
I have just the person in mind for the job.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.399
Once again, Mylene.

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.731
You've impressed me.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:23.664
I couldn't have chosen better myself.

00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:29.494
[\u266a]

00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:32.759
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Revenge of the Vexos\".

00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:37.857
[\u266a]

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.989
Hey Drago.

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:40.689
How you feeling?

00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:41.921
Incredible.

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:43.654
I've never felt so energetic.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:45.919
Well, I'm glad at least one of us feeling okay

00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:47.486
this morning.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.618
I couldn't sleep last night, thinking about

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:51.050
Zenoheld and the BT System.

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:52.982
Try not to worry, Mira.

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.082
I know.

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.315
I just wish there was a way to get in touch with

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:57.481
Baron and Ace to see if everything is okay on Vestal.

00:02:57.514 --> 00:02:59.313
I hate not knowing.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.812
Well, it's not like you can send them an email or

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.145
a text message.

00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:03.444
Don't make yourself crazy.

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:06.477
Let's just have to hope for the best until we know for sure.

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.842
When I received my Attribute Energy along

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.407
with Willda, Elfin and Ingram, it caused a change in us.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.139
We've never been stronger or more ready for battle.

00:03:15.172 --> 00:03:17.337
It's probably the same for Nemus and Percival.

00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:18.537
They'll be fine.

00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:20.103
Mmmhmm. I know you're right, but I feel like something

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:21.869
really bad is about to happen.

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:26.734
Catch you later, Mom.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:27.866
Baron!

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:28.999
Huh.

00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:30.032
Sweetie, could you be a dear and pick me up a few

00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:32.230
things I need to prepare dinner? [baby talk]

00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:33.264
Sure Mom.

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:34.363
Hey, big brother.

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.562
Huh? Oh hi, Maron.

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.028
Watcha doin'?

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.361
Helping Mommy water the flowers.

00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:41.326
Where are you running off to, Baron?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.992
Well, I was gonna hang at the mall, but mom needs me

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:44.424
to get some stuff.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:45.658
What are you building?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.156
Well, it's getting so crowded inside, I thought

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.489
I'd build a mini-guest house for Nemus.

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:52.721
That's very kind of you but unnecessary since

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:53.953
Baron and I will...

00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:55.852
What he means is, that's a great idea, Dad.

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:57.884
[Laughing]

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:00.683
[Laughs]

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:01.883
Hmmm?

00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.982
Are you going to Earth again, like last time?

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:05.348
No, no,no, silly.

00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.747
I'm just going to do some grocery shopping for Mommy.

00:04:10.212 --> 00:04:14.177
Well if Maron had her way, we'd all live together forever.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.776
Isn't that right, sweetie?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.909
Hah, imagine that.

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.841
Baron why haven't you...

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:19.975
Uh, we better go.

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:21.540
Don't want to keep Mom waiting.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:22.540
See ya!

00:04:22.573 --> 00:04:24.639
See you later guys!

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:26.872
You don't understand.

00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:28.470
I have to wait for the right moment.

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:30.170
When I tell them that I'm planning on moving out,

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.869
it's gonna break their hearts.

00:04:31.902 --> 00:04:33.435
Then why move out at all?

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:35.000
You have a lovely family.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:37.566
And your brothers and sister look up to you like a hero.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.332
Yeah, I guess you're right, they do, but...

00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:42.930
You just got home after being away for so long.

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:44.096
What's your hurry?

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.596
Enjoy some time with your family.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:46.628
Yeah, maybe.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.161
I started thinking about this, because Ace always

00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:50.093
tells me to grow up.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.126
Grow up.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.559
Uhhh...

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.991
He's right. You need your independence. It's time.

00:04:55.024 --> 00:04:57.257
Time for what? I don't understand.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.989
Leave the boy alone, Percival.

00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:02.021
If he wants to stay he wants to stay.

00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:04.220
I'm just saying, Nemus, that since receiving the

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:06.652
Attribute Energies you and I have evolved.

00:05:06.686 --> 00:05:08.518
Why can't Baron evolve too?

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.517
So all that stuff last night with the Six Ancient

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.649
Warriors really did happen?

00:05:12.683 --> 00:05:13.882
I wasn't dreaming?

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:15.515
Take a look at Percival and Nemus.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.313
If that was a dream they wouldn't look like they do now.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:20.412
And I'll bet the same is true for Willda, Elfin,

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.978
Ingram and Drago.

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.144
King Zeonheld's hatred for the Bakugan isn't the only

00:05:24.177 --> 00:05:25.842
thing that's grown stronger.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.175
I feel it too.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.541
Me too.

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:30.440
If Zenoheld and the Vexos want to challenge us, then

00:05:30.473 --> 00:05:31.973
I am ready.

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:33.106
Well, hopefully it won't come to that.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.339
Think fast.

00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:35.938
Whoa...ahhhh

00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.038
I bookmarked some apartments I

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.469
definitely think you should go and see.

00:05:39.503 --> 00:05:41.102
Awesome, thanks man.

00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:43.267
Wow these are really sweet places.

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:47.299
Check it. This one even has a ping-pong table.

00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:48.499
Trust me, Baron.

00:05:48.532 --> 00:05:49.698
You're gonna thank me.

00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:52.130
A big time Brawler like you needs his own sweet

00:05:52.163 --> 00:05:53.696
bachelor pad.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.362
But how will you pay for it, Baron?

00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.595
I don't think your allowance is enough to

00:05:56.628 --> 00:05:57.761
cover rent.

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.459
Ahhh, he's right.

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.760
These places are kind of expensive.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.891
Maybe I can stick it out a little longer at home.

00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:06.256
[Screams]

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.523
[Gulp/horrified]

00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:09.655
I'll find myself a part time job to make some extra cash.

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:11.388
Who'd hire you?

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.687
All you do is play videogames and eat

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.352
cheeseburgers.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:17.285
I know, imagine if I could get paid for that?

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:19.217
Get a job bagging groceries.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.716
Ahh!

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.716
Huh?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.049
Groceries.

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.248
I was supposed to pick up some for my Mom for dinner tonight.

00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:27.380
Oh man, she's gonna be so mad at me, I'd better go.

00:06:27.413 --> 00:06:28.546
Okay.

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:30.711
Nemus, If we hurry we can get the stuff and still

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:32.011
make it back home.

00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:33.077
Catch you later, Ace.

00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.177
Thanks for the apartment listings.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.276
I'll let you know how it goes.

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.408
That boy's got a head full of rocks.

00:06:37.441 --> 00:06:39.041
Yeah, but a heart made of gold.

00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:43.472
[\u266a]

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:45.238
...then he said he'd call me but he never did.

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.104
What a jerk.

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:48.436
Huh?

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.201
Ahhh, very nice.

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:54.367
Hey, check it out.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.900
Is that who I think it is?

00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:56.999
What?

00:06:57.032 --> 00:06:58.899
Over there, by the glasses.

00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:00.397
Who does that look like to you?

00:07:03.596 --> 00:07:05.629
I'd forgotten how peaceful Vestal can be.

00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:08.161
Everyone is so happy and carefree.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.425
Well, I guess that's about to change.

You're back!

00:07:15.423 --> 00:07:16.689
What did you bring us?

00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:17.823
Yeah, whatcha got?

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:19.122
Hey guys.

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:22.087
Hey Baron? Do you think you can take me to the park?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.253
The park?

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.785
Mommy says we're running out of room, so I though

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.085
we could take the extra flowers to the park.

00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:29.650
Okay, sounds like a good idea.

00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:31.116
Let's go to the park and play.

[Rowdy and giddy laughter and chatter]

Baron, I'm sensing something...

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.271
Huh?

00:07:55.304 --> 00:07:58.303
Whoa!

00:07:58.337 --> 00:08:00.202
Hello Baron.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.266
That looks like...

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:06.565
It can't be.

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.031
What's the matter, Baron?

00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:09.531
What's with the face?

00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:12.497
You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:16.794
Prince Hydron?

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:19.960
The new and improved Nemus is about to be put to the test.

00:08:19.993 --> 00:08:21.126
Stick around to see him in action.

00:08:23.424 --> 00:08:24.390
Dryoid's gonna do some serious damage.

What are you doing here?

00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:34.885
No need to bother with titles, Baron.

00:08:34.918 --> 00:08:36.785
I'm not a Prince anymore, thanks to you and the

Well then what do you say, Brawler?

00:08:42.715 --> 00:08:44.948
Well then, do you think you can take a break from

00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:48.213

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:51.777

We'll see who the boy is.

Don't worry, he may look big and scary, but you've

evolved, Nemus buddy.

Hang on a second.

Nemus, what's happening?

00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:34.899
It's a command card that sucks up whichever

Attribute Energy I tell it to.

Face it, Baron...

Nemus is no match for my mechanical Dryoid.

Give up now and spare him the pain.

You got it, buddy.

What did he say?

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:58.688
Not an attribute change?

I don't believe he's shown us his full powers yet.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.753
We'll win this one.

00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:41.118
Bakugan Brawl!

00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:43.718
Bakugan Stand!

00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:47.949
[Mighty roar]

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:51.814
Bakugan Trap Hoas Piercian.

00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:57.878
[\u266a]

00:16:57.911 --> 00:16:59.910
Double ability, activate!

00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:01.842
Ability card, set.

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:06.273
Electrocution Plus, Bakugan Multiplier.

00:17:06.307 --> 00:17:14.103
[\u266a]

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:15.602
Easy, Dryoid.

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:17.568
Wait for it.

00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:20.767
Haaahhhhh!

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.463
[\u266a]

00:17:27.497 --> 00:17:28.596
Hmmmph.

00:17:28.629 --> 00:17:32.361
Ability Activate, Murasame Blade.

00:17:34.193 --> 00:17:36.026
Come on!

00:17:37.492 --> 00:17:41.889
Fusion Ability, Activate, Shoo Dragon Fly.

00:17:43.622 --> 00:17:45.555
[Pain/exertion]

00:17:47.654 --> 00:17:51.451
Fusion Ability Activate, Geki, Grit Demon!

00:17:54.517 --> 00:17:56.483
[Pain]

00:17:56.516 --> 00:17:58.415
Nemus! Piercian!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.080
The end is in sight.

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.946
Any last words, Baron?

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:05.912
Gate Card, open!

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:07.544
Silent Land!

00:18:10.242 --> 00:18:11.242
The Silent Land

00:18:11.276 --> 00:18:13.908
Gate Card renders one's opponent immobile.

00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:16.540
It also nullifies the ability they are using.

00:18:16.573 --> 00:18:18.605
So now, your mighty Bakugan is nothing more

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:22.570
than a helpless baby.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:25.868
Ready Baron? It's showtime!

00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:28.967
[Pain]

00:18:29.001 --> 00:18:31.166
Nemus! Piercian!

00:18:31.199 --> 00:18:33.632
[Laughing]

00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:35.564
Stop it.

00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:36.930
[Pain]

00:18:36.963 --> 00:18:38.396
Stop it.

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:40.328
I said stop it Hydron, now!

00:18:40.362 --> 00:18:42.094
The Brawler wants it to stop.

00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:44.759
Let's grant him his wish.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.258
[Howl in pain]

00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:50.357
Nemus!

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.521
[\u266a]

00:18:55.554 --> 00:18:59.919
And now it's time for me to take...your Haos energy.

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:05.049
[howls, pain]

00:19:05.083 --> 00:19:15.111
[\u266a]

00:19:15.111 --> 00:19:20.909
[\u266a]

00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:22.242
King Zenoheld.

00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:25.240
Sensors indicate we've just acquired the Haos Energy.

00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:28.572
I knew I could count on you, Hydron.

00:19:31.204 --> 00:19:33.103
Hmmph.

00:19:36.368 --> 00:19:39.700
Baron, are you okay?

00:19:39.733 --> 00:19:41.032
Nemus?

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:42.665
Baron, I am sorry.

00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:45.264
I thought I was strong enough but I just couldn't...

00:19:45.297 --> 00:19:46.363
[grunt]

00:19:46.396 --> 00:19:48.596
...and now we've lost the precious Haos Energy.

00:19:48.629 --> 00:19:49.995
Don't to be sorry Nemus.

00:19:50.028 --> 00:19:52.261
You fought a hard battle and showed your bravery.

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:53.893
[Laughs]

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.092
How pathetic you are Baron.

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:58.357
Quit trying to put a brave face on your defeat is

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.356
humiliating, take your lumps like a man.

00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:03.288
Get out of here!

00:20:03.322 --> 00:20:05.321
Big brother.

00:20:05.354 --> 00:20:07.819
Who was that strange man you were yelling at?

00:20:07.853 --> 00:20:08.986
Him?

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:12.684
He's...uh...

00:20:12.717 --> 00:20:13.916
What happened?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.349
Is Nemus okay?

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.715
I'll be okay, little one.

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:17.981
Thanks for your concern.

00:20:18.014 --> 00:20:20.680
In fact, I think I'm starting to feel better already.

00:20:20.713 --> 00:20:23.479
[Giggles]

00:20:23.512 --> 00:20:24.878
[\u266a]

00:20:24.911 --> 00:20:26.910
Another noisy battle like today's will surely alert

00:20:26.944 --> 00:20:29.176
the remaining Bakugan to our presence.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.409
Work on your stealth.

00:20:30.442 --> 00:20:32.475
You're just jealous that I was the first to capture

00:20:32.508 --> 00:20:34.740
one of the Attribute Abilities, Mylene.

00:20:34.774 --> 00:20:37.206
Get used to it.

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.839
Hmmph.

00:20:38.872 --> 00:20:46.334
[Ooohing and ahhhhing]

00:20:47.468 --> 00:20:48.600
Hmmm.

00:20:48.633 --> 00:20:50.399
You realize that today was just the beginning.

00:20:50.432 --> 00:20:52.498
Zenoheld has challenged us to a new battle.

00:20:52.531 --> 00:20:53.665
I know.

00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:56.030
Listen up, we'll find a way to contact Master Dan

00:20:56.063 --> 00:20:59.595
and the others, we'll fight the Vexos!

00:20:59.628 --> 00:21:01.993
Spoken like a true Brawler!

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:05.592
I think perhaps you already have grown up.

00:21:08.957 --> 00:21:09.924
After we freed New Vestroia things were

00:21:09.957 --> 00:21:11.923
supposed to get back to normal.

00:21:11.956 --> 00:21:15.189
But I can tell you, life on Vestal is anything but.

00:21:15.222 --> 00:21:17.288
First Mylene showed up with this giant Mechanical

00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:19.920
Bakugan and these little Robot Attack Drones that

00:21:19.953 --> 00:21:21.752
started swarming Percival.

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:24.751
They might be tiny but boy did they pack a wallop.

00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.483
Then some weird Mermaid thing floated up out of the lake.

00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:28.582
Crazy.

00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:30.514
And wait, who's this guy?

00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:32.214
Bakugan, brawl!

00:21:33.513 --> 00:21:35.012
Let's go Percival.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.912
I'm right behind you, Ace.

00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:46.973
[\u266a]

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:56.601
[\u266a]
