WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.142
DAN: Not long after we freed New Vestroia,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.311
King Zenoheld came out of hiding, and brought

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.214
with him the Bakugan Termination System.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.250
It's a machine designed to destroy all of the Bakugan.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.152
But in order to power it he needed the attribute

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.688
energies of the Six Ancient Warriors.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.323
DAN: But the Ancients tricked Zenoheld and

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.892
transferred their powers to six Bakugan.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.294
DAN: Their energies caused the Bakugan to evolve into

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.563
more powerful versions of themselves.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.465
DAN: The fate of the Bakugan is in our hands

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.600
and the stakes are high.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.335
But we're ready to fight!

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.138
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.541
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.576
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.811
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.579
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.047
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.816
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.217
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.253
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:57.090
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.959
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.862
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.264
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.218
DAN: So this is the place, huh Spectra?

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.319
ACE: Incredible.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.588
We're actually inside the Vexos nerve centre.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.056
So cool.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.758
BARON: I've heard stories about how big it is,

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.728
but now that I see it with my own eyes...oh man!

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.665
MIRA: Whoa, this place is more heavily fortified.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.100
DRAGO: It's too quiet.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.401
I don't like it.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.836
SHUN: We better start looking for the Bakugan

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.572
Termination System before the Vexos realize we're here.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.610
MYLENE: You called sir?

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.445
MYLENE: Your message sounded urgent.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.948
ZENOHELD: Mmm-hmm...Look behind you.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.750
SHADOW PROVE: Huh?

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.319
VOLT: Brawlers?

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.154
MYLENE: But how did they find this place?

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.156
PRINCE HYDRON: That weasel Spectra, no doubt.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.059
ZENOHELD: What a wonderful surprise he's brought us.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.628
LYNC: Oh boy, this should be awful interesting.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.563
SHADOW PROVE: Someone's about to go down, real hard...

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.598
Yeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.304
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Avenging Spectra.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.808
DAN: Alright guys...Pitter-patter.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.443
The clock is ticking.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.178
MIRA: Dan, this place is massive.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.213
How do we even know where to start?

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.381
DAN: Hey Spectra.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.516
How 'bout a little help?

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.851
Taking down Zenoheld is a good thing for both of us.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.453
SPECTRA: The bet we made was to show you

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.154
the location of the palace, Dan.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.657
Not do your dirty work for you.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.858
DAN: What?

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.059
MARUCHO: Come on, Spectra.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.327
You in a bad mood?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.862
What's with all the attitude, huh?

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.231
SPECTRA: It appears that... you think we're partners,

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.333
but let me assure you, we're not.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.602
GUS: Master Spectra has honoured his part of the bargain.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:50.937
Now get lost.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.338
We owe you nothing more.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.307
DAN: Huh? I don't understand you guys.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.009
We should be united on this.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.944
SPECTRA: You're a fool to think we could ever be

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.579
united on anything.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:00.847
Let's go, Gus.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.682
GUS: Yes, Master Spectra.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.553
BARON: Man, those guys are a couple of real jerks.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.787
ACE: For Sure.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.055
BARON: Yup.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.823
MIRA: Are you guys really that surprised?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.625
C'mon we need to start our search.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.830
DAN: Yeah.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.632
SPECTRA: Come now.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.402
Is that any way to greet your former leader?

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.603
Oh, that's right.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.104
You left me for dead.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.472
MYLENE: Yah, well

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.107
...should've stayed that way traitor.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.542
GUS: [growls]

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.144
ZENOHELD: It's been a long time.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.712
Welcome home, Spectra.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.213
SPECTRA: This wretched place could never be home

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.915
to me, Zenoheld.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.684
PRINCE HYDRON: Hey, watch your mouth, Spectra.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.185
ZENOHELD: Enough, Hydron...

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.188
I don't understand why you're so hostile, Spectra,

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.959
after bringing me the wonderful gift of the Brawlers.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.560
SPECTRA: Bringing them here was a gift to them...

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.962
not you.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.698
They're here to destroy your precious BT System.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.865
VOLT: What's that?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.167
SHADOW PROVE: Yeaaaaahhh.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.602
And I'll bet you came along to help them,

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:56.636
didn't you?

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.904
GUS: [growls]

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.339
MYLENE: Let's all calm down.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.341
SPECTRA: Mylene is right, Gus.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.009
GUS: Yes, Master Spectra.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.478
PRINCE HYDRON: Father...Let me go.

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:06.946
I'll capture the Brawlers.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.548
ZENOHELD: No need to panic, Hydron...

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.184
The Brawlers pose no real threat to the BT System

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.852
or our plans.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:15.688
SPECTRA: Are you sure about that, Zenoheld?

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.157
Enough to bet your future on it?

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.560
ZENOHELD: Worry not, Spectra.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.031
DAN: Oh man, it's gotta be around here somewhere.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.165
DRAGO: Dan.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.167
We can't just keep wandering aimlessly like this.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.169
ACE: We're too exposed out here.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.038
We could be caught by the Vexos.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.140
MIRA: Ya, Drago and Ace are right, Dan.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.842
MARUCHO: Perhaps we could devise a better grid

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.710
for our search pattern.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.212
SHUN: If we were Zenoheld...

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.948
Where would we hide the BT System?

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.616
DAN: Up there, probably.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.451
BARON: Where it's really hard to get at.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.819
MIRA: Quick, let's hop in that.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.994
ROBOT DRIVER: Input destination, please.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.929
DAN: Take us to the BT System.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:58.564
ROBOT DRIVER: Sorry, you do not have the correct

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.700
authorization for that destination.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.068
DAN: Of course not.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.804
MIRA: Here, let me try something.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:07.106
ACE: It's working.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.241
MIRA: Yup.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.576
I managed to override the internal security system.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.577
DAN: Okay.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.546
To the BT System and step on it.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.350
ROBOT DRIVER: Buckle up 'cuz....

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.518
...here we...

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.153
...GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.426
ZENOHELD: Now then, Spectra.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.261
I'm sure you wouldn't have come all this way unless

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.662
you wanted something.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.897
So what is it?

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.498
GUS: How dare you sit there so smugly, after you

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.333
falsely accused Master Spectra and framed him...

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.235
I'm gonna make you pay.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.337
ZENOHELD: Come on.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.571
Out with it.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.506
SPECTRA: Alright, since you asked so nicely...

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.842
I want you to leave the Brawlers alone.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.277
ZENOHELD: What's that?

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.479
My boy, you've got to be kidding me.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.748
SPECTRA: I promise you I am very serious;

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.417
but if you do this, we can start again.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.186
I will wipe the slate clean and forget that you

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.121
ever falsely accused me.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.456
MYLENE: Falsely accused you?

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.224
SHADOW PROVE: What's this trash you're talkin', traitor?

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.592
Huuuuuhhh?

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.494
PRINCE HYDRON: Enough!

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.596
I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.331
ZENOHELD: It seems you've gotten things backward

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.833
here, Spectra.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.102
It is you who is hurling the false accusations...

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.770
What is clear, however...

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:14.240
is your undeniable betrayal of the Vexos.

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.309
What do you have to say for yourself?

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:18.144
PRINCE HYDRON: Let's hear you lie your way out of this one.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.178
GUS: Silence!

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.713
I will not allow you to mock Master Spectra

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:21.814
any further!

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:22.982
SPECTRA: Gus!

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.450
What did I say?

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.651
GUS: But sir...

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.919
SPECTRA: No buts.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.121
We're here to negotiate...

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.123
We don't have time for this childish bickering.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.758
GUS: I'm sorry, Master Spectra.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.559
SPECTRA: I'll say it again.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.795
SPECTRA: I want you to leave the Brawlers alone...

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.530
if you know what's good for you,

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:38.831
you'll listen to me.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.500
ZENOHELD: I see time has done nothing to lessen

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.701
your arrogance.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.270
I think it's time you were on your way, Spectra.

You're lucky my father, King Zenoheld,

I doubt it.

to battle me with, little man?

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:04.277
GUS: You're a fool to underestimate Vulcan.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.013
After my reprogramming he has only one function:

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.948
Loyalty to Master Spectra.

as I thought you were, my cocky young friend.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.485
GUS: Friend, you say?

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.420
You obviously have me mistaken

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.522

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.791

never able to conquer New Vestroia...

GUS: What?

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.758
