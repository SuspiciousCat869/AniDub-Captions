WEBVTT

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.141
DAN: Marucho, Drago and I were on a mission

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.776
to save New Vestroia.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.011
So we joined up

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.912
with the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.815
Mira... Ace... And Baron.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.285
Now we can battle the Vexos and free the Bakugan!

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.087
Every battle makes us stronger

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.957
and brings us closer to our goal.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.626
Now we just have to smash all three Dimension Controllers

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.461
to free the Bakugan!

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.497
How hard can that be?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.432
We're ready to roll...

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.933
Bakugan Brawl!

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.338
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.643
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.713
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.148
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.949
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.384
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.420
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.257
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.126
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.264
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.635
Enough insolence.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.370
Ability Activate!

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.838
Drill Impact!

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:19.412
[pained cry]

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.148
GUS: That is why you'll never be good enough to defeat me!

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.150
Say goodbye, Dan Kuso.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.719
Dan! Look out!

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.457
So ends the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.094
[pained groan]

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.628
DAN: Just in time, partner.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.796
[annoyed grunt]

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.031
Behind you!

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.508
Drago!

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.877
[panting]

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.978
Whoa!

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.913
Are you all right, Dan?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.182
What's going on?

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.750
Who's attacking?

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.453
Did you just wake up from having a nightmare?

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.388
Yeah, I guess I was...

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.756
Sorry to wake you.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.291
Some nightmare you had...

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.361
Every single Vestal on the planet must have heard you.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.030
You'd have bad dreams too

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.900
if you lost a Bakugan Brawl as badly as Master Dan did.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.135
Nice one.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.436
You know what Marucho.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.471
Baron is right...

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.706
Drago...

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.174
Time to start training...

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.109
In the middle of the night?

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.845
Drago! Drago?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.181
Hey guys...

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.116
You seen Drago?

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.988
For the first time, I wonder if I have the strength

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.823
to do what must be done.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:40.760
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.629
in \"Return of a Friend\"!

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.135
Wayvern...

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.438
You sacrificed your life to save our world

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:55.708
and I will protect it to my last breath...

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.809
But...

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.845
I can't do it alone...

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.680
DAN: Drago!

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.714
There you are...

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.349
Why are you all alone out here?

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.717
Just... thinking.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:06.953
Me too...

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.454
Now let's get to work.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.293
He woke you too...

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.460
Are you worried?

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.662
[dismissive chuckle]

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.130
Not about him...

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.065
But if he brawls at this hour...

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:23.102
The released power could give the Vestals a fix on us.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.742
DAN: Nice move, Drago!

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.877
[confident roar]

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.579
Ability Activate!

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.447
Okay...

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.149
Now I'm bored...

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:39.018
Wake me when the Vestals attack, okay Mira?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.155
[amused chuckle] Right...

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.923
Pretend you don't care.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:53.232
A toast to the famous Six Warrior Bakugan...

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.169
The most powerful Bakugan of each attribute.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.004
And you're all mine.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.374
[laughs]

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.142
So tell me...

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.411
Why do I have only five?

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.549
Spectra!

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.653
What is going on?

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.655
You defeated the human and yet I still have

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:18.992
no Pyrus Dragonoid in my collection.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.093
SPECTRA: Why yes...

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.428
My apologies to you Prince Hydron.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.763
HYDRON: You're supposed to be the best Brawler

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.465
on New Vestroia.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.000
So prove it.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.068
I understand your frustration...

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:33.006
I will not fail but these things take time, my lord.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.540
Well ok then...

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.643
I'm counting on you Spectra...

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:39.245
It would be unwise to disappoint me.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.315
I expect to hear good news from you soon.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.421
You spoiled little brat.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:51.557
I take complete responsibility Master ...

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.127
My failure has caused your continued disfavour.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.294
Not so...

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.596
You accomplished much...

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.930
Gus.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.467
Our spoiled Prince is just throwing a childish tantrum...

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.203
He wants his new toy.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.938
Careful, Master...

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.442
You never know who could be listening in on us.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.177
Let them listen.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.445
Come.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.746
There is much to do.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.782
Of course... Master Spectra.

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.223
ACE: If we follow this valley

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:27.193
we should get close to the city undetected.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.328
I can have us there by sundown, guys.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.997
Pedal to the metal!

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.565
[big bite/chewing]

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.367
So does this mean that we're actually going to

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.436
go into enemy territory now?

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.904
It's about time we started destroying

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.173
those Vestal Dimension Controllers...

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.641
[laughs] Oh man!

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.509
The Vexos are gonna freak out!

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:44.644
Dan!

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.812
Stay focused.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.280
Hold on...

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.414
I have...

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.749
something else to discuss.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.017
[shivering]

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.719
Is something wrong?

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:53.886
Nothing...

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.121
I just have to go.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.490
[annoyed sigh] Too much information.

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.659
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.572
[satisfied sigh]

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:14.207
GUS: Greetings, Dan Kuso.

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.111
DAN: Gus?

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.379
What is a Vexos doing here?

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.781
How did you get into our headquarters.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.983
Whah?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.386
I get it... You're just a hologram.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.588
I warn you...

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.623
Today I will take your Drago away.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.791
As if!

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:34.193
I understand if you refuse my challenge.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.796
After losing to me once you're probably afraid.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.231
However...

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.967
If you do have the guts to take me on again, human...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.870
My little spy will lead you right to me.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.372
DAN: Come here, you.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.307
I'll take you on...

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.409
This time I'll slap you down for good!

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.611
Are you nuts?

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.212
You want to postpone destroying

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.781
the Dimension Controllers...

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.417
and go off on some kind of wild goose chase?

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.286
My brother will be a big help if we can find him.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.354
Let it go...

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.990
We've had too many distractions already.

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.359
We're supposed to be freeing the Bakugan!

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.727
That is what I'm doing!

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.728
Ooookay.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.496
Let's all just take a deep breath here.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.898
Forget it, Marucho...

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.001
Once those two start they can go for hours.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.036
DAN: Drago...

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.538
Dan?

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.639
Let's blow.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:21.207
We're going? Where?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.009
Gus challenged us to a rematch...

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.077
So now we have to go meet him.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.512
Sounds like a trap.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.914
I know it does...

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.850
But it's another chance to free Vulcan from the Vexos.

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.185
I'm in.

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:35.321
But shouldn't we tell Marucho and the others?

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.089
Please don't fight, guys.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.559
Seriously, you're worse than a couple of two year olds.

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:40.793
How about a group hug?

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:43.462
Or a sing-a-long maybe? Guys?

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.630
Let's not.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.898
They're kinda busy right now...

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.202
Besides this is a one on one Bakugan Battle.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.736
ACE: I'm not negative!

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.105
In fact, I'm positive your plan is ridiculous.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.541
DAN: We'll be back before they know we're gone.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.679
Okay, Bugface.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.447
Now show me where Gus is.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.389
You made it.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.490
You bet...

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:13.659
This chance was too sweet to pass up.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:16.262
I really hope you've been practicing, Gus...

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.597
I won't go easy!

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.664
[derisive laugh]

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.900
Your overconfidence will be your downfall.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.402
BOTH: Gauntlet Power Strike!

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.539

Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.812
Scorch'em, Drago...

GUS: You were fools to face us again.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.811
Now you'll see why.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.780
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

[derisive laugh]

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.290
Your last-second ability saved Drago...

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:54.126
But you lost precious Life Points in the process.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.730
Are you okay... Drago?

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.498
DRAGO: [groan] I've felt better.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.734
But you've lost half your life points.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.135
Sorry, my friend.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.470
Not a problem...

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.772
We're just getting started!

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.441
DAN: One rematch, coming up!

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:09.642
Right Drago?

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:10.743
DRAGO: Believe it!

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.148
VULCAN: Let's get brawlin'!

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:17.817
It's my turn to start...

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.218

[battle roar]

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.366
Interesting...

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.001
This Drago...

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:39.905
he had once been the perfect Dragonoid Bakugan.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:43.676
And then he became the core of New Vestroia...

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:47.880
How could he return to Bakugan form after that?

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.815
Good question...

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:52.618
Helios, I have a very good feeling...

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:56.022
that if we engage this Bakugan in battle ourselves

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.257
everything will become clear.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.760
SPECTRA: Bakugan Stand!

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:03.662

Scorpion!

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.882
It's the Bakugan Trap.

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.785
It's my turn to take you down in one move.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:28.220
GAUNTLET: Ability Card Set.

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:48.240
I will never let that human take Vulcan.

[cocky laugh]

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.724
Looks like we're even.

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:06.792
GUS: That's alright.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.428
I haven't even begun to brawl.

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:12.231
I'm through playing around with you...

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.601
I'll handle this, Gus.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:16.936
This is my battle.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.904
Who are you? ...Or what?

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:22.074
I am Spectra Phantom...

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.276
Leader of the Vexos.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.645
You think I'm impressed by that?

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.347
[dismissive laugh] Not much.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.350
So back off, Spectra \"Leader of the Vexos\".

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.686
I've got a battle to finish with Gus.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.221
[amused chuckle]

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.756
You should learn to be more respectful

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:38.624
of your superiors...

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.793
It is an honour for an amateur such as yourself

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:42.194
to lose...

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.263
to the top ranked brawler.

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.398

Bakugan Stand!

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.478
Now... Bring out Drago.

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.914
Nobody... tells me how to brawl...

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:03.382
But since you're...

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.985
asking for it, I'll battle you...

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.520
Ready... Drago?

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:08.587
Ready!

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.356

THINKING: That Dragonoid is magnificent.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:21.367
Now to put him to the test and see what he's got...

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.669
Double Ability Activate.

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.504

Plus Item Core!

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.679
No way!

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.282
He's split in two and doubled his power level.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.816
Give me a break...

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.386
I want to make a little detour, that's all.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:42.988
No way... It's pointless.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.757
I call a cease-fire...

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.992
You need to look at this.

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.394
What's that?

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:51.363
That's gotta be Drago!

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.965
MARUCHO: Dan must have slipped out

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.334
and got involved in a Bakugan Battle.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.336
I hope he's not battling Gus.

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.704
He needs us.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:03.309
[screech]

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.911
THINKING: This Dragonoid's

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.279
attack powers and defense skills

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.014
are nothing remarkable.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.150
Perhaps it's time to wrap this battle up

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.086
and deliver my gift to Prince Hydra.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.988
Take this!

Plus, Burning Tornado.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.431
And don't forget Fusion Ability!

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.499
Pyrus Slayer!

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.601
What the...?

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.836
That's a Triple Ability!

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.671

[gasping pain] Vulcan's wiped out my Ability.

DAN: The difference in our power levels

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.687
is more than 500 points!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.623
Prepare to meet your doom!

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.928
Ah man, now who's attacking me?

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:57.763
[panting]

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.198
What is that?

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.933
No way... It's him.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:08.040
DAN: Yes! It's Shun!

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:32.865
GUS: [gasp] It can't be.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:35.401
Sorry I failed, Master Spectra.

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.735
It's fine...

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.570
I'll take it from here...

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.439
Helios... Are you ready?

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.041
HELIOS: I am, Master.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.175
Let's go.

Drago! What... is it?!

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:02.328
I don't know, Dan, but this one is powerful!

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.797
That's Helios.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.365
It's you, Shun!

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.801
No! You mean Shun Kazami?

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.936
So how's it going... Dan?

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:12.104
Okay...

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.772
Except for a problem named Spectra.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.140
I can't wait to meet him...

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.476
Whaddya say we show him how it's done?

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:19.912
Sounds good to me... Partner...

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:23.048
Hey Spectra, it's time to get this party started!

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.750
Hmm...

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:27.886
THINKING: If that Dragonoid can use Triple Ability,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.124
he's probably got other powers he's hiding from me.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.827
Ability Activate!

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.096
Claw Thunder Position...

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.831
Kagenui!

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.680
THINKING: I must see all the Dragonoid's powers...

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:58.283
Ability Activate!

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.785
General Quasar!

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.598
[snarling roar]

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:15.801
And to think you were once the perfect Dragonoid...

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:19.204
Now you're no better than that Tigrerra I crushed.

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:20.406
What?

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.474
You were the one who took Tigrerra?!

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.876
That's right.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.378
And Tigrerra cried for mercy.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.679
Just like you will.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.481
[fiendish laugh]

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.184
I will make you pay for that!

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.622
Drago! What's wrong?

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:40.192
Is he telling me to use this card?

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:44.163
[battle attack roar]

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.798
Magnificent!

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.932
Come on...

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.200
Don't hold back.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.601
Show me everything you've got!

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.271
Ability Activate!

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:54.740
Strike Dragon!

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:57.009
[battle attack roar]

00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:09.688
[\u266a]

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.957
GAUNTLET: Power Level exchange complete.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:24.102
GAUNTLET: Spectra Life Gauge Zero.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.839
Way to go, Master Dan!

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:29.741
Excellent work, Helios...

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.376
Let's go, Gus.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.780
Right away... Master Spectra.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.315
DAN: Come back anytime

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.517
and we'll give you a free lesson in battle brawling.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.320
Now that I have seen the powers of the Dragonoid...

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:45.591
I can't allow it to be just a plaything.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.464
DAN: So where have you been, Man?

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:54.900
You just disappeared off the face of the earth.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:57.202
It was... really weird...

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.805
I was up in the mountains by myself...

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.708
working on my ninja skills...

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:05.110
When suddenly a crack in the dimension appeared

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.478
in front of me.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.948
[scream]

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.084
SHUN: I was sucked into it and the next thing I knew...

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.386
I landed here.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:17.289
Wherever here was.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.491
Where am I?

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:22.294
And how did I get here?

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.196
It's hard to say for sure...

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.431
But maybe when we Vestals arrived in New Vestroia

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:29.568
it created a distortion in the dimensions.

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.436
Makes sense...

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.906
And it would explain why we couldn't get through

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.340
to you on Earth.

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:38.477
Then pretty soon after that I met Ingram.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.813
[frightened screaming]

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.286
INGRAM: [gasp] What's happening?

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.790
Thank you for saving me.

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:53.759
I will always be indebted to you.

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.260
My name is Ingram.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.796
And I am Shun Kazami.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:00.732
Shun, are you a Vestal?

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.301
A Vestal?

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.837
You mean the guys who are sucking up all the Bakugan?

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.105
No way, man...

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:08.307
So what's the deal?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.676
Who's hoovering up you guys and why?

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.546
SHUN: Ingram told me about the Vestals.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.815
And from that moment on,

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:19.484
I devoted myself to freeing the Bakugan.

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.087
Hey Shun.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.589
Was that you who saved me and Elfin

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.924
when I battled against Mylene?

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:36.134
[\u266a]

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.036
I hoped that was my brother.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.504
You've got to face it... Mira...

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.707
Come on...You'll see your brother

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.176
when he wants to be seen and not before.

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.344
But Shun...

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:46.812
Why did you disappear?

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.747
Why didn't you just show yourself after the battle

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.482
and then come join us?

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:51.717
Sorry Dan...

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.219
I had to get back to something extremely important.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.354
What could be more important

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.888
than your old brawling partners?

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.624
We're almost there!

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:01.493
Alpha City New Vestroia!

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.662
Hey, just where I was heading...

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.465
I'm going to break in and find Skyress.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.102
It's Mira here.

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.603
We finally arrive in the city and right away

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.839
Dan and the others put together a plan

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.607
to destroy the controller.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.542
But I don't join them.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:20.445
I have something I have to take care of by myself.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.581
But can I handle it alone?

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:26.385
And the Vexos have something new up their sleeves.

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.021
Could it be a mechanical Bakugan?

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:31.390
Don't miss the next episode.

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:33.592
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.360
See you then... Brawlers!
