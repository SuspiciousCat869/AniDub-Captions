00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.808
When the Vestals invaded New Vestroia and captured

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.544
all the Bakugan, they didn't count on Drago and

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.681
I returning to free our friends.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.250
Time to get... serious!

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.285
So we joined the Bakugan Battle Brawlers

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.887
Resistance!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.690
Together we have a chance to defeat the Vexos, take

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:27.594
back New Vestroia and save the Bakugan once and for all!

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.895
[battle squawk]

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.263
Let's go, Drago!

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.932
Bakugan... Brawl!

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:45.245
[\u266a]

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:54.888
[\u266a]

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.834
Bakugan Brawl!

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.603
[ready for battle roar]

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.472
Okay, you want Drago?

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.974
Bakugan Brawl!

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.711
Stand Pyrus Drago!

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:22.649
Oh No!

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.883
That's Drago?

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.351
What have they done to you?

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.523
Are we too late?

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.960
[threatening battle roar]

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.434
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Gone, Gone Bakugan\".

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.538
[evil, ready for battle roar]

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.207
Drago!

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.375
[threatening growl]

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.643
Horrible...

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.845
That's Drago?

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.446
Not the Drago I know.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.981
[wary growl]

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.150
[bestial growl]

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.188
[attack roar]

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.389
Drago stop!

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.091
Listen to me!

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.826
It's Dan, your partner!

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.961
Incredible...

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:11.831
Even Drago could not resist the power of the Vexos.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.099
It doesn't matter...

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.467
Drago's still Drago...

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.436
No matter what happens, he and I will always be

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.238
connected. I know it!

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.973
I'll never give up on him!

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.241
You hear me Drago?

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.609
I'm not going to give up!

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.078
[considering growl]

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.613
He hears me!

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.048
[threatening, evil roar]

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.419
Master Dan, watch out!

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.021
[warning roar]

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:37.090
Drago attacked me?

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.291
[attack roar]

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.627
[effort/tackling]

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.564
[head butting roar]

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.934
[closed-mouth, smug laugh]

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.103
Bakugan are no more than animals...

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.905
I am Drago's master now.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.907
He is under my complete control.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.974
[animal-like growl and snort]

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.243
Talk all you want. He can't hear you anymore.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.246
Yeah, that's what you think...

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.381
Come on Spectra...

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.850
go ahead, laugh it up!

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:07.153
I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face!

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:10.323
And after I tear you apart I'm gonna change Drago

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.524
back to himself!

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.126
You hear me?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.495
That is a promise.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.763
Pathetic earthling.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.797
You're welcome to try but...

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.266
you and that fossil Bakugan don't stand a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.435
chance against the Perfect Core combined with the

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.805
Forbidden Card: Chaos Ability X!

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.206
Ability... Activate!

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.008
Deinococcus X!

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:34.948
[\u266a]

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.318

[lust for battle roar]

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.023
Drago Power Increase!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.260
Keep it together Drago. We're gonna save you!

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.761
Ability Card Set!

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.963
Ability Activate.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.464
Maximum Nova!

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.633
[powering up roar]

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.435
Apollonir, increase 200.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:58.237
Nice try but my move isn't finished yet.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.207
Have you forgotten what the Forbidden Card does so soon?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.044
It pushes Bakugan past their limits to the extreme.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.615
Of course, they pay a price for infinite power.

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:11.517
[powering up roar]

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.952
No way!

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.055
Master Drago's Power Level has gone up even more!

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.223
Bonus.

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.892
And thanks to Deinococcus X ability, Drago's Power

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.630
Level will always be 200 more than his opponent's level!

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.498
Your move.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.800
How is Dan supposed to beat that move?

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.235
Spectra's cornered him.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.571
This battle's going downhill fast.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.072
Just how many abilities does that Forbidden Card

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.741
have anyway?

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.477
That's too much for one Bakugan, Spectra.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.978
You're overloading him!

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.213
Hah!

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.981
What's the point of having power if you're afraid to

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.282
use it?

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:46.019
That's why you'll never beat me!

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.854
Let's go, Drago!

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.622
Ability Card, Set!

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.424

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.230
Drago power increase 200!

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.132
Oh no! Watch out, Dan!

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.668
He can't raise Apollonir's Power Level...

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:02.902
They're through!

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.037
Maybe not...

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.272
I've still got cards to play!

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.241
Ability Activate!

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:09.876
Neo Valute!

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.716
You forgot that ability Neo Valute brings the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.253
opponent's power level down to Apollonir's base level!

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.655
That makes Deinococcus X kinda useless doesn't it?

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.923
[angry roar]

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.224
Top this, poser.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.794
It will take Drago's Power Level down to zero!

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.563

Saiam Low!

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:40.940
Come Drago.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.910
It is time to return to your friends!

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.845
[defiant roar]

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.049
Drago's Power Level is dropping!

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.118
Dan's found a way to beat them without hurting his

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.453
best friend!

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.987
Awesome move, Dan!

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.390
[frustrated/weakening roar]

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.858
Enough of this!

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.360
Ability... Activate!

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.298

[powering up growl]

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.779
What is this?

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.047
Can't you tell?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.616
Drago is stealing your Power Level and any chance

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.419
you had of defeating us!

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.122
Relax. It'll all be over in a minute.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.723
Oh you've got that right!

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.960
Ability Activate!

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.661
Dispel Roa!

[frustrated growl]

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.000
We're back to square one!

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.435
I don't believe it!

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.906
Dispel Roa returns all Bakugan Power Levels to

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.307
their base level!

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.943
And that means Apollonir is gonna leave Drago in

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:52.278
the dust!

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.715
I'll shake some sense into you!

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.784
[effort]

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:01.888
[struggling]

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.895
Most impressive...

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.997
But futile.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.033
You can't win Drago back unless your Power Levels...

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:17.470
are at least 500 more than his.

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.305
It's up to you, Apollonir.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.306
Hmmph!

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.508
That's the best the dragonoid can do?

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.812
Spectra, let me finish the old one.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.480
I will demolish him!

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.881
You want to battle?

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.150
Don't be so anxious, Helios...

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:35.188
Why don't you sit back and enjoy the carnage!

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.889
Gate Card, Set!

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.294
You'll never take Drago!

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.896

[ready for battle roar]

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.038
I know you're in there, Drago!

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.641
And I'm never going to give up until I win you back!

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.511
Bakugan Brawl!

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.812

So full of hope.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.518
But how will you feel after you see what this

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.386
Forbidden Card does?

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.088
Ability Activate!

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.156

[powering up roar]

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.497
He's using another Forbidden Card!

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.270
Oh no!

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:25.538
Drago!

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:30.176
[in pain/struggling]

[fierce roar]

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.985
Can it be?

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.254
He's forced Drago to summon the power of the

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.889
Perfect Core!

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.223
[threatening growl]

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.791
But how?

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.960
With one of these, you old fool!

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.662
Fusion ability Activate!

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.565

[catching breath/recovering]

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.881
No! Drago used a Darkus Ability!

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.884
He's full of surprises now!

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.786
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.422
Fusion X!

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:21.460
[defiant/angry roar]

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:22.695
Impossible!

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.370
[extreme pain]

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.306
This time it's a Ventus ability!

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.808
But how can a Ventus ability do all that?

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.009
It's Spectra!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.479
He's forcing Drago to access the Perfect Core

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:44.283
within his body so he can use the powers of all six

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.584
attributes!

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:46.819
All six?

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.054
Oh snap!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.322
[cocky laugh]

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:50.589
... Now you get it!

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.525
Drago's perfect...

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.961
The other Bakugan we experimented on couldn't

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.063
handle so much power...

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.232
As long as I have Drago and the Forbidden Cards we

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.834
are unstoppable!

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.538
[threatening/powerful roar]

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.841
The Perfect Core does have unlimited powers.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.510
If Drago were still the perfect dragonoid he'd be

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:15.314
able to access all six attributes with ease.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.249
But he's not anymore.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.454
We gave Drago a temporary body and split the Perfect

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:25.958
Core's powers between he and New Vestroia.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.661
He should not be able to use all those abilities

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:29.729
right now.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.664
How is this possible?

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.265
It's the Forbidden Card.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.735
It forces him to absorb more and more power.

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:38.804
If Apollonir cannot stop it, Drago's body will burn

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:42.174
out and the Perfect Core may be lost forever.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.011
Apollonir and Dan must not fail.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:48.447
Or it's the end of New Vestoria.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.017
Destroy them, Drago!

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.985
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.321
Subterra X!

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:59.658
[angry roar]

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.564
[extreme pain/being struck]

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.233
Apollonir!

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.601
Stop it...

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.302
You gotta stop it, Drago!

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:13.506
Fusion Ability, Activate!

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:14.974
Aquos X!

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.024
This is so intense!

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:34.393
Apollonir's getting slammed!

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:37.463
Then I'll put him out of his misery!

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.265
Fusion Ability, Activate!

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:41.200
Haos X!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.573
[powering up roar]

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:49.575
[in pain/exhausted groan]

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:51.143
[weak but defiant roar]

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:57.817
[attack roar]

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.222
[extreme pain]

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.459
Drago...

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.764
[plaintive wail]

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.299
What the?

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.900
Drago's crying!

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.235
Drago?

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:18.170
You're tearing him apart!

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.405
Drago!

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.107
[weakening/plaintive wail]

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.509
The Power of the Forbidden Cards and the Perfect Core

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:25.044
are too great.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:28.380
The combined energy is burning out Drago's new body.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:29.915
He doesn't have much time.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:31.050
[shocked gasp]

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.184
What?

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.687
The new body we gave him wasn't meant to contain so

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.754
much might.

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.423
I'm afraid Drago could...

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.058
Drago could die!

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.861
Oh no!

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.929
What? What can I do?

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:47.133
[plaintive wail]

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.467
Drago!

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:52.638
[plaintive/weakening wail]

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:55.207
Stick around.

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.976
This may be Drago's last stand!

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.478
[\u266a]

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.413
Could this be my final battle?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.415
[pained roar]

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.450
Are you serious?

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.684
Drago... could die?

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.053
[pained roar]

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.289
He can't ...No way...

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.024
No. no. no...

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:15.060
Apollonir, we have to do something!

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:16.262
There may be a way.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.963
But it's risky...

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:22.535
If I transmute myself back into pure energy, I may be

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.538
able to enter Drago's body and absorb the extra

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:26.872
power.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.674
How do we make that happen?

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:32.411
We'd have to use Dragon Proudia, but...

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:33.445
But what?

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.713
Come on, man...

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.516
I'll do anything I have to to save Drago.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.120
For one thing, once Dragon Proudia is activated and I

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:44.256
become pure energy, I will not be able to attack or

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.457
defend at all.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.525
And then?

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.895
It will be up to you to throw me into Drago.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:52.398
But you'll only get one shot.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:56.835
You must hit the Perfect Core in his chest dead center.

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:59.471
There's no room for error...

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.507
Dan, do you understand?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.975
You can count on me...

00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.945
The only thing that matters is saving Drago.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.546
No, listen to me, Dan.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.081
This is not a game.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.517
If you miss, you may make his condition worse.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.853
You could end up taking Drago's life yourself!

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:14.954
[horrified gasp]

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:18.023
...But I can't risk that!

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:21.927
If we lose Drago, this world will be thrown into chaos.

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.129
The Perfect Core will not be able to hold the planet

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:25.197
together.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.833
And the collapse of New Vestroia will be upon us

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:29.768
once again.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.905
Well, Dan?

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.173
He's thinking...

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.475
Just look at them, Master Spectra...

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.345
They're so scared they don't know what to do.

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.779
Don't be a fool...

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.948
They're just weighing their options...

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:45.284
They don't want to harm their precious Drago ...

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:46.952
[fiendish laugh]

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:50.155
Drago will happily tear them apart.... Nothing

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:53.158
will be the same from here on!

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.960
Ability Activate...

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:56.495
Neo Legend X!

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:06.505
[\u266a]

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:07.806
[horrified gasp]

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.843
Snap! That's too much power for one Bakugan!

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.945
The energy of all six attributes in the Perfect

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.914
Core is pouring into him.

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:18.884
Neo Legend X combines all six attributes into one

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.654
invincible, bone-crushing ability...

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:25.024
So the question is, Dan Kuso, what are you going

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.558
to do now?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:31.163
[fiendish laugh]

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.265
Keith, what has happened to you?

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.069
Why are you doing this? Why!

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.638
[cries of pain]

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.977
[mighty battle roar]

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.046
Spectra! How can you do this?

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.447
Can't you see?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.716
All this power is destroying Drago.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.184
[evil laugh]

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.887
If the dragonoid doesn't survive then it just means

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.488
that he wasn't worthy...

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:59.858
Then I'll just have to find another Bakugan who is!

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.227
Worthy?

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.196
You monster...

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.831
That's it!

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.200
[evil chuckle]

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:11.337
[mighty battle roar]

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.473
We've got to make our move, Apollonir.

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.841
Are you sure?

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.477
There's no turning back once we begin.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.346
Drago is suffering.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.082
Even if I have a one percent chance...

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.550
I've go to do it.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.552
He's my battle partner and best friend.

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:27.820
End of story!

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.855
Drago! Help is on the way!

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:33.192
[mighty battle roar]

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.561
Very well then.

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:37.029
Let's do this...

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.398
Ability Activate!

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.233
Ability Card Set!

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.469
Dragon Proudia!

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.536
[mighty battle roar]

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:53.012
[\u266a]

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.146
What are they doing?

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.881
It's nothing I've ever seen.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.953
... Like it or not, I'm taking back Drago!

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:01.954
[battle attack roar]

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.689
[gasp] Wha...?! Is that a fork?

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:04.857
[intensifying battle attack roar]

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.091
He's gone nuts!

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:07.192
No way!

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.194
[intensifying battle attack roar]

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.462
The fool...

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:13.298
What does he think he can do against my greatest weapon?

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:14.933
It's now or never!

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.902
[battle roar]

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.003
Listen up, Spectra!

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.271
Drago's not your slave!

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.873
Not now! Not ever!

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:22.007
What!

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.610
He and I have a bond that you can never break.

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:27.279
A bond that will last until the end!

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.751
Together Drago and I will save New Vestroia!

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.555
Yes, Dan...

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:38.424
You can do it!

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:39.458
Yeah!

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.726
Show 'em what you're made of!

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:41.827
Go, Dan!

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.262
Get psyched, Master Dan!

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.931
[intense breathing]

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.400
[battle roar]

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:49.401
[intense breathing]

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:52.071
Draaaaa-goooo!

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.906
Drago... What are you doing?

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:57.276
I order you to eliminate that fool immediately!

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:59.845
[battle attack roar]

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.081
[horrified gasp]

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:05.918
[leaping effort]

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:12.357
Drago!

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:19.398
[intense running breathing]

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.034
Almost. Almost.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.035
[winding up breath]

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:24.736
Draaaaa-goooo!

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.674
[mighty throw effort]

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:29.808
What?

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:30.943
Oh no!

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:32.077
[gasp]

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:38.383
[intense pain]

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.421
Dan!

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.492
[groan]

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:51.463
Don't fight me, Drago.

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:53.565
[intense pain]

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.235
Power Level 27000 exchange complete.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:19:09.314
[groaning]

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.240
It is done.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.009
Yes, Apollonir came through.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.444
And young Dan has hit his mark.

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:42.481
Finally he and Drago will be reunited.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:47.553
Wow! He... did it.

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.121
Master Dan is my hero.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.455
Most awesome brawl...

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.723
... Ever!

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.493
What are we going to do now that Drago is gone?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:58.063
Never mind ... I got all the data I needed Gus.

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:00.832
The next time Dan Kuso and I meet, things will go

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.867
differently.

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:04.203
[gasp]

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.538
See you later, Battle Brawlers.

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:10.042
He doesn't look defeated.

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:13.045
Oh, Keith, what horrible plan are you going to come

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.047
up with next?

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.320
Drago?

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.521
Drago!

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.823
Drago, speak to me.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.192
Are you alright, pal?

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.564
Yes, Dan, I'm alright...

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:33.999
thanks to you.

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:36.368
I'm sorry I let you down.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.369
Aww...

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.638
No way you could let me down.

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.441
I'm the one who lost the battle and put you through

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:45.077
all that stuff with Spectra.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.145
I'm really sorry Drago.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:50.282
I'll never let that happen again.

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:53.652
If it's not my fault then it's not your fault either.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:54.953
Agreed?

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:57.689
Yeah, agreed...

00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.291
Partner...

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:02.294
[happy laughter]

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:10.168
Sure I got Drago back from that poser Spectra but now

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.771
I've got to go back to New Vestroia to help Marucho,

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.706
Shun and Ace.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.907
But I'm not alone.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.844
This time I'm taking the Battle Brawlers with me!

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:21.513
Nothing's gonna stop us from slamming those Vexos

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.282
down for good!

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.951
Except maybe a friend's betrayal!

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.853
Don't miss the next episode.

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.921
It's seriously intense!

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.057
Bakugan Brawl!

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.091
See you then, Brawlers!

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.762
What a ride!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:46.838
[\u266a]

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:56.481
