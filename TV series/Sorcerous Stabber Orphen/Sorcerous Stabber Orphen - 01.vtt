00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you for a while.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
That pendant is the one
they give to Black Sorcerers

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
who train at the
Tower of Fangs, right?

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Sure is.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
So if you have that,
it means you really did

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
study Sorcery there!

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
Then you learned Black
Sorcery from some

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
of the very best in the land!
Man, that's the coolest!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center

a Sorcerer or something?

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I am kind of interested.
Mom's from a Sorcerer family.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
If it runs in your family,

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
there's a chance that
you have a knack for it.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
Wow, do you mean it?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
Yeah, in fact I can
sense it in you.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
Then, do you think you can
teach me to use Sorcery?

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I could, though we would
need to talk about compensation.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.818 position:50% align:center
That's enough of that.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna weasel out
of your tab by tricking my son

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
into taking your phony lessons,
so don't try it.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
If you were that
good of a Sorcerer,

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't have to scrape out
a living making shady loans

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
to sketchy Dwarves, would you?
And I'm betting that line

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
about him having the
knack was a lie, too.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.585 position:50% align:center
That's harsh, man.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
I've been completely honest
with you guys this whole time.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.674 position:50% align:center
So what exactly makes
you think Majic

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
might have a talent
for Sorcery, anyway?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
There are Sorcerers in
his mother's bloodline.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
And what's more.
He has pure, sincere passion.

[gasps]

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
That's the most important
part of Sorcery.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
It's worth trying, at least.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.902 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Yeah, that's the truth.
But for me...

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
Welcome.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
Wow. I won't be your
only customer for once.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
Hey, buddy,

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
I've got a deal you're
not gonna wanna miss.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It's you two!

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN grunt]

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
That cop from before must
be gone by now, right?

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
Come on, the coast is clear.

00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN groans]

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
Why are you getting me
involved in this?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
You keep complaining

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
about not having
your money back yet.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
So this killer deal is my
way of paying it off!

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Your cut'll be half the profits.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
Why would I take a job from you
when you're the one who owes me?

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
Fine then! Have fun
covering your tab, pal.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I only have
a tab because of you!

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
Screw it, I'm in this monkey
suit, now what am I doin'?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.447 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
You'll know when we get there.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.367 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's weird. Uh.
So, where is everybody?

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN] I heard that something
showed up in a village nearby.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.456 position:50% align:center
What does "something" mean?

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
I don't know the answer to that,

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
but whatever it was, people are
scared to go outside.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
Who cares? Let's keep moving!

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
You better not've dragged
me into some kinda

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
shady business.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.426 position:50% align:center
[door clatters]

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Have we learned anything new?

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
"Because if we haven't,
then I've been waiting

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
for nothing this
entire time." Right?

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
Do you still not understand
that reading people's thoughts

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
unbidden is an abuse
of your abilities?

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
One should always make
use of the abilities

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
they've acquired.

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.989 position:50% align:center
And what if you weren't able?

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:40.116 position:50% align:center
My answer to that echoes
the thought that passed through

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
your mind just now. Indeed.
I would become like him, or her.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Hm.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Can you not imagine
an ability overpowering

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
the one who wields it?

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] When you speak of that,
do you refer to us?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
To follow your thinking
to its conclusion,

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
it seems one would have
to indict Sorcery itself.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
That's not my point.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
I'm fully aware of the value
of our training as Sorcerers.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
But the purpose
of that training,

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
the reason we risk our lives
for it here, is to allow us to

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
bridle the terrifying power
granted by Sorcery.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
Not to further
augment that power.

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
Perhaps that is so,

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
but your power has been
greatly augmented, hasn't it?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
Enough that you're now known
as the Keening of Death.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
I would prefer it if you didn't
call me by that nickname.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
Do you not get the sense we're
like children showing each other

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
the parlor tricks we've learned?

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
Yet surely you can't deny that
there is value in your title.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Right, Tish?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
I don't like that
nickname either.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.840 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
On that note, what shall we call
her, after five years missing?

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
The Chaos-- No.

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
The one once known
as the Chaos Witch.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
O Wind! Hyah!

What a monster.

But we have to take it down.

We've been ordered by the elders
of the Tower to annihilate it!

[SWAINE]
Where is it going?

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Across the mountains
to Totokanta.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN gasps] Back home in
Mebrenst, you wouldn't find

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.203 position:50% align:center
a single soul who doesn't
know the name "Burplewarts"!

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.121 position:50% align:center

That's my name?

[VOLKAN laughs]
Come now! I know sitting

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.377 position:50% align:center
in front of these beautiful
ladies is nerve-wracking,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
but surely you can at least
remember your own name,

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
Mr. Warts!

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
And being from Mebrenst,
I'm sure you belong

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
to a well-established
line of nobles, yes?

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
Nobles? Ah!

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes indeed!

and make his own fortune.

May I ask how?

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
Manufacturing sleeping pills.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN gasps]
Why that?

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Sleeping pills?
That's our sales pitch?

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
Just go with it!

You know all that fancy Sorcery,

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
so some improv shouldn't
be that hard, ya schmuck!

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center

in this goofy-looking

in front of these women

in their giant mansion
with no explanation,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
and make me pretend to be
a guy named "Burplewarts?"

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
Hey, Volkan never told me
anything about his plan,

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.055 position:50% align:center
so this whole scheme
is news to me, too!

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.474 position:50% align:center
Of course, 'cause this trick
is far too elaborate for me

a couple of simpletons li--

Yeah, Mom and Mariabelle

Shut up!

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN, DORTIN gasp]

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could improvise
our way out of this mess

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
if you'd shut up a minute
and stop trying to pin

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
your dumb scam on me!

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH laughs]
I get it now!

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
This whole thing was
a bit, wasn't it?

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
And in a few seconds, someone's
going to walk in with a big sign

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
and tell me where your
comedy troupe is playing.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right, Miss!

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
Fraud gets you a
15-year sentence, by the way.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN gasps]

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
I was coerced into doing this!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
But still.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
That part about you being a
Sorcerer was true, huh?

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Uh, don't worry about
the damage to your floor.

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
I repair thee.
Scars of the Sunset.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
That's so cool! Oh wait,
that just reminded me.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
Another Sorcerer
came here before.

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
Really? Is that so?

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
Yeah. To see Dad.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what a Sorcerer
would've wanted from him,

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.717 position:50% align:center
but I guess he was
helping them out.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
Ah. I should mention
my father passed

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
from an illness two years ago.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to hear
about your loss, Miss.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
I remember him saying
he had come from Tafrem.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
And he had this
weird-looking pendant on.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
Well, the Tower of
Fangs is in Tafrem,

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
so that makes sense.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
The place is crawling
with Sorcerers.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
I might know who he was
if you describe him to me.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
Could you?

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Uh. I remember
the guy being pretty built.

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
Long black hair tied
back into a ponytail.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
We've just entered
the city of Totokanta.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
Hello, Master.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:20.809 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON]
Heartia!

00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
You know him?

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
He's one of Childman's former
students, and secretary at the

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
local Continental Sorcerers'
Association branch.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
When was it? Tell me!

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
It was a pretty long time ago,

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
way back before I
even started school.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
Though now that you mention it,

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
somebody like that also showed
up about five years ago.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
They apparently came to deliver

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
something important
to my father.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Is that it?

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Huh?

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
I think there's a
chance that it was...

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[UOAR]
Hurry!

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Hey. Let's get outta here!

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN gasps]

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
Mr. Burplewarts!

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
My name isn't Burplewarts.
It's Orphen.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
 As in... "an orphan?"

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's right.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
[TISHTINIE, MARIABELLE shouting]

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
Mom? Mariabelle?

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Sorcerer? Hey!
Come on! Let's get moving!

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
[TISHTINIE, MARIABELLE shouting]

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
[shouts] I've got no choice,
do I? It never ends!

00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH grunts]

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I request thine
invitation. Untrodden Gate!

Mom. Sis!

[gasps]

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Azalie! Hey!
Don't you remember me?

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
I've been searching for so long!

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

Azalie, wait!

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
That sword.

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
Over here!

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center

Stop right there!

[grunting]

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
Somebody's attacking us!

[ALL gasp]

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.445 position:50% align:center
Fire!

[shouting]

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I unsheathe thee!
Come now, Sword of Light!

[BOTH gasp] 

00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Hurry up and
use your stupid magic tricks

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
to take down that
monster already!

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.797 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
That's not a monster.

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Well, get rid of it
before I jab a butter knife

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
into your brain!
