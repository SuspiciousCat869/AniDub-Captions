00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] It's time.
Prepare to move out.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Hm? So you came in the end.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
The squad will be
marching shortly.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
We're going to need you to
take point for this fight.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
After all, we won't
have to write

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
a letter of apology
if you die. Let's go.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
You came, Krylancelo.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.919 position:50% align:center
Hello, Comicron.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.297 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
These are experienced Sorcerers.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Some of whom I know well.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
But I can't let that get to me.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.473 position:50% align:center
I'm going to protect her,
no matter what.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] In order to assemble a
squad with this many Sorcerers,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.325 position:50% align:center
someone would normally have
to seek direct permission

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50% align:center
from the King himself.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
I'm sure this isn't a
legal expedition.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
On top of that...

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
That guy walking in the back.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
Can he seal off
Azalie's White Sorcery?

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
I don't know,

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50% align:center
but the possibility alone made
him worth bringing to the fight.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
There's no guarantee
that one White Sorcerer

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
will be able to seal
the powers of another.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
This is a knife fight,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
and we stand a better chance if
we have a blade of our own.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
Then you launched this
mission knowing

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
that there would be sacrifices.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
Some of these people are
marching toward their deaths.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center
But you don't care how
many of them die

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
with Azalie's first attack
as long as there's

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
one of you left alive who
can land a killing blow.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] They are all
well aware of the risk.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.625 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The band of
Sorcerers walked on in silence

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
for what seemed an eternity,
though they knew the journey

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
would end when they
found their target,

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
and the quiet would give way
to the cacophony of battle.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
How much longer
do we have to walk?

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
If you can't hack it,
then go home!

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
We're happy to keep
your cut for ourselves!

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by, "my cut?"

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
If we captured that thing,

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
we could get heaps of
cash for it, no doubt.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
And we get a powerful
magic sword as a bonus!

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
Wait, say what?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
I had those fraud charges
dropped for a reason, you creep!

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
We're going to help Orphen,

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.126 position:50% align:center
so you can keep your
stupid schemes to yourself.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN grunts]
You wanna go?

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
You don't scare me at all.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.840 position:50% align:center
I'm better with a sword
than you might think.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
Wanna find out how my
school's Soldiers Club does it?!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
What kinda club is that?

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.013 position:50% align:center
Calm down, both of you!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
We're in more than enough
danger without you two

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
swinging your
swords around, okay?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
[low rumbling]

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
And please cut it out with
that creepy growling, too!

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50% align:center
I don't think that
was either of us.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center

[ALL scream]

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] These are the
best Black Sorcerers 

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
that the Tower of Fangs
has to offer.

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
Not to mention...

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
...one man who's
powerful enough

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
to go toe-to-toe with
the Thirteen Apostles.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
Childman.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.926 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Can I win this fight?

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Get it together.

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
I have to reach Azalie
before they do.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
Otherwise...

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
...she's going to die.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I feel it. She's close.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It would be insane
to call out to her here.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
But I never could have
made it this far

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
if I didn't trust my instincts.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center

Azalie!

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
She answered my call!

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Why'd she burn the forest?

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It's me, Azalie.
We have to go. Right now!

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
I was your friend.
Don't you remember?

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
She was clearing space
so that we could fight.

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
Gather at my command,
Shield of Amber!

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Have you really lost
yourself to that monster?

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Are you... trying to kill me?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Her magical
power is overwhelming.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I came to convince her to run.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] But if we fight,
I can't beat her.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I thought I'd
gotten away from you.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] You did, and that's
exactly why I brought you.

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
You're the tip of the
spear in this operation.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
[growls]
Bastard.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Here, Krylancelo.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
Heal!

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
I specialized in
Healing Sorcery.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

Now bind my enemies
and seal away those

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
forces which they would
bring to bear against me,

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
that I may triumph and
be preserved from harm.

[ORPHEN] I dance within thee.
Heavenly Castle!

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Without this,
they'll have no way

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
to track her if she
flees the battlefield.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center

That monster you keep
calling "Azalie."

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center

If you would stay and fight,

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
we might stand a
chance against her.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
If you had been back
there with us,

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50% align:center
maybe Comicron would still
be alive right now!

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.676 position:50% align:center
So please...

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna help you kill her.
I'll make her human again!

to change her back.

to use that sword was Azalie.

That was a Hairy Howler.

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
It startles its prey
with a loud roar,

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
then chases them
down relentlessly.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
Once the prey is exhausted,
it goes in for the kill.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.179 position:50% align:center
Now, would you care to tell
me what you're doing here?

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
I was worried about you,
so I came here to help!

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.354 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Heartia.
Everything you said is true.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
You have a point and
I can't deny it.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.318 position:50% align:center
But I still have to do
what my heart tells me.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
From here on out,
no more deaths.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
Don't come after me, guys.
Don't even move.

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Mm-hmm.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
They're all dead.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
No, look over there!

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
O Light!

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] She's casting a
spell to defend herself

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
from Master's attack.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
But she still isn't using
her White Sorcery,

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
even against that kind of power!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Could she have lost
the ability completely?

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
O Wall!

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, HEARTIA grunt]

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN grunts]

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Chainmail of Haloes!

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Are you trying to save me?

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I'm not going to stand
back and watch you get killed.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
But I'm still no match for her!

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You're one of the most
powerful Sorcerers alive,

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
so how is she holding
her own against you?

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
Hark, O Light!

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
No!

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee,
Sword of Light!

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] You're making
a lot of work for yourself.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
How long do you intend
to prevent our attacks

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
from landing?

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
I know there's a way
to save Azalie.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
I know that she
doesn't have to die!

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] You've become
a great man, Krylancelo.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
If the day comes when
I name a successor,

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
you'll be my first choice.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Now's not the time.

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.932 position:50% align:center
What are you doing...?

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
Childman...

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
I'll heal you soon,

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
but right now I have a
mission to complete.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Damn... you.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
O Chaos!

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
You can't!

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
Azalie.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.438 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie!

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Repair.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps, sobs]

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie. I'm here. It's Orphe--

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
It's Krylancelo.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to say?

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] I'll return this
sword to the Tower, Master.

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Mm.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Stop the coach.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
Show yourself.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
You knew I'd be waiting for you,
so let's make it quick.

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] What do you
hope to accomplish here?

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
Feel free to drop
the act anytime.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
You should know exactly
why I came here.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] I'm sorry,
but I haven't the slightest--

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
Some at the Tower
want you punished

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
for what they see
as your betrayal.

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
But the operation may have
failed had you not been there

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
to find the monster and
lure it into the open.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
In the end, I was
able to convince

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.401 position:50% align:center
the Masters to let you go.

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
You talk more than you used to.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
It's almost like you're not
really Childman at all.

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
When did you figure it out?

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
Right after you had landed the
killing blow on that monster.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
It had something left to say.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
Now, why did things
end up like this?

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:51.678 position:50% align:center
I at least deserve an honest
answer to that, don't I, Azalie?

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
If you get one, what then?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
I'll decide when I hear it.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
I like that response. When we
were reunited, I could tell.

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
You've gotten stronger.
I'm impressed.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
I had no choice. Still, it seems
I haven't gotten any smarter.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
You might be right about that.
But I don't mind.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's always been one of
my favorite things about you.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.125 position:50% align:center
Out of everybody I
trained with at the Tower,

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
you alone had the potential
to become a great Sorcerer.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
I've always believed that.

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
You were the only one I would
have wanted to be my partner.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
You were the only one who
ever truly understood me.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
None of the rest could
see through to the person

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
that I really am,
the way you could.

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
Five years ago.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] After our experiment
turned me into that creature,

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
and I fled the Tower,

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
my consciousness
faded in mid-flight.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
It took five years for
my senses to return.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
All the while, you had
been growing up.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
That boy, my little brother,
has become a man.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:10.006 position:50% align:center
How long has your consciousness
been inside Childman's body?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Since he awakened
and decided to hunt me down.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
It was a gamble.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I believed
that if I ever wanted

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
to return to my own body,
I would need the sword.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
That's why I let
Childman lead me to it.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Anybody cut by this
blade can be transformed

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
according to the
wielder's desires.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
But when I used it,
I lost my concentration.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
That's why I was transformed
into that monster.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
Now that I have it back,
I can take another gamble,

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
and hope that it will
return my body to me.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
There's your answer.
So, what are you going to do?

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I'm gonna end
this charade of yours

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
and avenge Childman's death.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.598 position:50% align:center
I never intended
for him to die.

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
If his life mattered to you,

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
you would have
found another way!

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
That's what the Azalie who I
believed in would have done!

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I've always
believed in you, too.

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
And if I were back
in my own body,

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
I'd give you all of me
to make you see that.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
Enough. How many ways are you
going to betray me, Azalie?

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] All I've been through
feels like some kind of

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
test now.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Like I'm having to prove myself
to the friends I've left behind.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
The day we set this in motion,

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
my life was forfeit,
but you're still alive.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
You can save her.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:49.939 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE grunts]

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I know you meant
to spare me, Azalie.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:13.755 position:50% align:center
But even if you didn't, you
could never have cut me down.

00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
I had something to protect me,
but only from a single blow.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
And you were the one
who first showed it to me.

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
It's a spell. "Be disarmed,
my foes," is how it's read.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
It seems like this ring
was meant to protect

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
the person wearing
it from an attack.

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
The ring.

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It was far too small to wear.

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
But just small enough
that I could swallow it.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If I cut you with
that sword, I would be able to

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
transform you into anything
I wished for, right?

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
Or I can leave you in Childman's
body if that's what you want,

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
though I don't know how long
it will last with that wound.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
It's up to you where
your life goes from here.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
Whatever you ask,
I'll give it to you.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Why did you spare me?

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
Because, he wanted you to live.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
No. You're lying. Childman had
been trying to kill me himself!

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
Think.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
Why would he take the risk of
coming for you personally?

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
Because, he wanted
his own body back.
