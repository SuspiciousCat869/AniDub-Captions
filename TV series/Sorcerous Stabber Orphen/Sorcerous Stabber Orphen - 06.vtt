00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.845 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] Then, in order to
protect that which is yours,

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
you would take my
powers for your own?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.267 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS]
O Master. Grant us protection.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
We beseech you to
safeguard our souls.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
O Master. Grant us protection.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.086 position:50% align:center
We beseech you to
safeguard our souls.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
Silence!

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.925 position:50% align:center
The shrine maiden shall now
deliver our Master's message.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:23.018 position:50% align:center
Calm your hearts, children.
You are safe.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
Calamity has passed.
Offer your prayers.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
And as to the Sorcerer.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
Should he make his heretical
presence known again,

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
I shall exterminate
him by my own hand.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS cheering]
O Master. O Master.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
Let us give our prayers to
the master who protects us.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
He has retreated into the forest
after driving the heretic away!

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
Prosperity to the
heart of this forest!

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS] Prosperity to
the heart of this forest!

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
Prosperity. Is that so?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.305 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS] Prosperity to
the heart of this forest!

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.313 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Who's there?

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. That attack was
carried out on my orders.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I was... attacked?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
But I miscalculated.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
I never expected or intended for
the dragon to try and maim you.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
I'm going to use my powers
to heal you now,

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
as much as I am able.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
And I ask that you
not defy MacDougal.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:40.345 position:50% align:center
After all, without him,
this village would...

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.352 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] What happened.
Where am I?

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
I... Who am I?

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
I feel pain. Where is it?
Am I drawing breath? From where?

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] It appears
you've awakened, Sorcerer.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
We're in a place where the true

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
Sorcery of the
Dragons holds sway,

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
and charlatans like you
are shunned and kept out

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
of decent people's sight,
as you should be.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
Now, what is your name?

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
You refuse to say.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] I'm sure it's just
a matter of pride for him.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
Explain yourself, Salua.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
That pendant around his neck

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
is the emblem of the
Tower of Fangs.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
The home of
Black Sorcery's elite.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
For such a man to be
captured so easily...

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
It would shame him.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] Hmph. Elite or not,
he stood no chance.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.783 position:50% align:center
Not against this weapon.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] I wouldn't be
so eager to use that.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
Have you forgotten your place?

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Not at all, MacDougal.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
You're the one in charge
of this village.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
MacDougal?

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
 And I ask that you
not defy MacDougal.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL exhales]
It would be simple enough

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.894 position:50% align:center
to execute you
right here and now.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
Sadly, the fact is that a
Sorcerer from the Tower of Fangs

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
intruded on our village.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
If I kill you,
I'll never know why.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
So I need you to
tell me everything

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
before we leave tomorrow.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
Or else, we'll pull out your
teeth without anesthesia.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL chuckles]

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
Prosperity be unto our
sad little Sorcerer. Hm.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Food for the kid, huh?

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
Earlier, when you told the
villagers that you would

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
exterminate the Sorcerer,

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
I heard the trembling
in your voice.

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
What? Well...

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
That could be a problem,
if you're supposed to be

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
a messenger of the divine.
It's not too convincing.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
But I... I was just...

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
Well, goodnight, Shrine Maiden.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
You're up. Are you in pain?

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.347 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
No, I'm okay.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
I brought you dinner,
if you need it.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Not right now.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
I have to admit.
When that gunshot hit me,

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
I was pretty sure that would be
the end of the road for me.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.241 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] But I was there to
heal you, thank goodness.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
Did you use Sorcery?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
The forest's power.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
Well, it was strong
enough to save my life.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
So, where is your family?

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
Family?

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
I mean... I'm sorry.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Do you live in this
place by yourself?

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] It's not safe for
me to appear in front of

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
others too often.

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
If I did, things could go awry.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
I'm only a tool,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
and my purpose is to keep
the villagers in line.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
I make an appearance
during our rituals.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:40.377 position:50% align:center
I deliver the Master's words
as they're given to me,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
and then I perform miracles
for the sake of the village.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
Then was healing my
wounds a miracle?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
That wasn't my duty
to the Master.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
It was a choice
that I made myself.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, your choice is
the reason I'm still alive,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
so thank you for that.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
Hey, think I could get
some different clothes?

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
[FIENA giggles]

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you're
enjoying this.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.527 position:50% align:center
No! I didn't mean to laugh.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50% align:center
I'm kidding, it's fine.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
Fiena. it's almost
time to leave.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you earlier?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:15.537 position:50% align:center
[FIENA grunts]

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] Then why haven't
you gotten ready yet?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
I was--

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
When you were wandering
lost through the forest,

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
trembling and alone in
the fog, who saved you?

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
Though you found me,
I was never lost.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
Really? What were
you doing, then?

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
I went into the
forest to find you.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm?

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] You say you were
looking for me? Ha, ha, ha...

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.120 position:50% align:center
Then I suppose it must be
fate which has united us.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] It's because
of your arrival here

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
that I've been able to put
this plan into action at last.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
The forest heard my wish,

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
and in response, it brought
you straight to me.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
Your Dragon Sorcery will
grant me what I desire.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
That power of yours
is going to lead us

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.100 position:50% align:center
to the heart of this forest.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
But that's not--

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
I wasn't asking you to
share your thoughts.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
Hey, enough already!

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
Shut up. I'll tell you
when you can speak.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
Majic, please don't.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] It's okay, he's not
gonna shoot me again.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
I said you need to
shut your mouth.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I have something to say first.

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
Fiena's a person,
and you don't own her!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
Hm...

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]
Stop this now, MacDougal!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
My hand...

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
How dare you defy me, girl?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
Let my life be
the only one lost.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
Foolishness! If
you turn against me now,

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
you know what will
become of the village!

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL grunts]

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
Be ready to leave
tomorrow morning.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC exhales]

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry about that.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
But I'd still like to
know where my clothes are.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. Your wounds
are all healed now.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
It's best if you leave
in the morning.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
We'll both go.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
I want you to come with me.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I can't.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
But why not?

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
If you stay here, they're going
to drag you into doing something

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
you don't want to,
aren't they?

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me,
you're in real danger.

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
I'm not leaving you here!

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
Majic...

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
Not when your face
is so full of sadness.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't be right.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
Earlier, when I got to see
you smile for a moment?

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
That's how it should be.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
I see now. You're a kind soul.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
I mean. I, just, uh...

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
But please understand there's
no way I can leave this forest.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
If it's because of MacDougal,
then don't worry.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.011 position:50% align:center
My master can deal with him.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
Your master?

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and there's another
girl we're traveling with.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
Her name's Claiomh.
She's a good kid on the inside.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:29.356 position:50% align:center
Sorry. There's something
that I forgot to mention.

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:33.568 position:50% align:center
How'd you get yourself
thrown in jail?!

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Stop screaming.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
My headache is
bad enough already.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
How can you help us escape if
you're lying there paralyzed?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you let
something like this happen!

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
I got hit by a powerful
mental attack.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
It's practically a
miracle that I'm alive.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
What's a mental attack?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It's Sorcery
used by the Deep Dragon.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
All I did was look in its eyes,
and it was over.

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
My mental control
training from the Tower

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
is what saved me in the end.
If not for that...

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
...I could have had
my mind scarred,

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
or been physically and
mentally destroyed outright.

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Instead I just lost
consciousness and my memories.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
I hope you know
this is your fault.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, right! You got caught
because you messed up

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
and now you're trying
to pin your failure on me!

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
I was being nursed back
to health after I sustained

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
a terrible injury during
my heroic effort to save 

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.495 position:50% align:center
my new friend, Fiena, here.

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.205 position:50% align:center
While you were messing around
and getting captured,

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
she was helping me recover from
a gunshot wound to the gut.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
Help me pay her back,
hurry up and heal,

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
and then we can all
regroup with Claiomh

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
and get the heck
out of this dump!

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
Trying to look tough for
a girl. How embarrassing.

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not. Shut up!
That's not what going on here!

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
It's just that she helped
me out. So I...

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Hm! You're at
that age, right, kid?

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps] I'm telling you,
you've got it all wrong!

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
Your name's Fiena, right?

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
Uh, it is.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Your healing
saved me, so thank you.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
Oh. Of course.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hold on. You healed him?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she pulled me
back from the brink,

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
and that must have required
incredibly strong Sorcery.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
Far beyond human ability.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] I'm going to use my
powers to heal you now,

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
as much as I am able.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
--[banging]
--[DORTIN, VOLKAN yell]

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.906 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Now it all makes sense.

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
The villagers knew to look
for a Sorcerer in the forest 

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
because you told them to!

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
Hey, hold on.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
You're not actually
aiming for us, right?

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Of course not.
I don't wanna kill you.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
Not yet. I'm gonna
take my time with this!

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN, VOLKAN yell]

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Master!
Not that I don't get it,

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
but you still need to
conserve your power.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
Listen to the kid, magic man!

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
What are you idiots doing?

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN gasps]
Big Bro!

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
We could use a hand here!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] Looks like you're
recovering well, Sorcerer.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
Good to see.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
I'm Salua, by the way.
And you are?

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Orphen.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Hmph! Orphen, huh? Heh.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Hm!

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
[BOTH shout]

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] So was the
paralysis just an act?

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I wish it was.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
[BOTH whimper]

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.658 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN grunts]

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN grunts]

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
Impressive. You're
not bad, Krylancelo.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
Really? Are we going in there?

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
Not a good idea.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
We're in Fenrir's Forest,
close to the Dragon's Sanctuary.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
This place is off limits.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
The royal family and the
Kimluck Church warned us.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
But they captured my friend,
and my manservant!

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
[RANGER A]
Come on, guys,

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
we should just report
it to the royal family.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
Let them deal with it.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
I thought rangers were
supposed to be tough,

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
so how'd they let you
three slip through?

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] You all can sit
here cowering in the forest.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
I'm going in.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] The Successor
of the Razor's Edge.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
That's the inscription
on your pendant.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
And your old nickname, too.
Right, Krylancelo?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
You were the first in line
to succeed Childman

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
as the most powerful Black
Sorcerer on Kiesalhima.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
The official story was
that you had disappeared

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
from the Tower of Fangs
five years ago.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
And yet, here you are.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
I told you to shut up!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] Well your way of
fighting is certainly crude.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That doesn't mean
much coming from a guy

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
with a knife in his hand.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
I thought that you were a
former ranger, but I was wrong.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
That's a glass sword!

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] One of only eight
on the whole continent.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
I see. You're a
Death Instructor.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Salua Solude.

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to know that
you're familiar with our work.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
It's a cute name for the
brutal team of assassins

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
working for the
Kimluck Church.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
When somebody steps out of line,

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
you get sent in to shut them
up quickly and quietly.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
The question is,

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
what are you doing here in
the middle of the forest?

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
I could ask the same thing
of you, though, Krylancelo.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
An elite Sorcerer from
the Tower of Fangs.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
Why would he show up here?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Enough already!

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
[SALUA grunts]

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
And the winner, by knockout,
is Miss Claiomh!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Where did you come from?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
The door right there.

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
I figured I could take him
out while you two were

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
glaring at each other.

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN sighs]
Why are you here?

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
You said to get the rangers.
I'm just doing what you told me!

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
I left them waiting at
the edge of the village.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
What I told you to do was to
go back to the ranger station

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
and wait for me.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Is that right?
It must have slipped my mind.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
Anyway. What're we gonna
do with all these guys

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
that are knocked-out.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Majic's here, too.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
Uh! Even the crime
dwarves showed up!

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]
Salua! And Majic?

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
What happened here?

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] A lot. Don't worry,
everybody's still alive.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
--Well?
--This girl's a shrine maiden.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
I need you to regroup with
the rangers and help them

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
clear a path through
the village for us.

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
No way! I know you wanna
get rid of me again!

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
Why can't you just let me stick
around and help you for once?

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
Because you're kind
of in the way.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
[growls]
You big jerk...! Excuse me?

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Understood. I'll go on ahead.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
Sorcery?

00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
Yes. It will wear
off by morning.

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
I have a request. Please run.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:07.230 position:50% align:center
Take Majic and Salua with you
and get out of this village.

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
I can't join you.
My place is here.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Hm. Well if you insist.
But this guy's with the Church.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
I know.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Mm?

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] I understand that
he's a Death Instructor.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:24.706 position:50% align:center
I learned that about him

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
when I looked into
his heart by accident.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
But he's also one of the
only people in this village

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
who ever spoke to
me as a friend.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
That's why. I'd like to
make sure he's safe.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.261 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Poor Majic just
can't catch a break.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
Salua came to kill MacDougal.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.564 position:50% align:center
A few years ago,
MacDougal left his position

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
as an instructor with
the Kimluck Church.

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
Then how'd he end up
becoming the chief

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
of a hidden village of
Dragon worshippers?

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
I know little about his history,
so I can't answer that.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
I was brought to this forest to
deal with the Deep Dragon 

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
who protects it. There's not
much else I can tell you.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
All I can say is
that he's a hero

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
to the people of this village.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
This weapon is the only
thing that will allow you

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
to fight against a
Sorcerer on equal terms.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Firearms have been
outlawed by the royal family,

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
but if you wish to defend
yourselves against the enemies

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.892 position:50% align:center
of the Dragons,

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
there's no choice but to build
more and learn to use them.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
Crush the Sorcerers.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
That's how we'll demonstrate
our loyalty to the Deep Dragon.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
It's not enough.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center
I need an even more
powerful weapon.

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] I must travel deep
into the heart of this forest.

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
To the Dragon's sanctuary.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
Okay, but if you go into
the heart of the forest,

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
you're gonna die.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
Yes, I'm aware.

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:59.092 position:50% align:center
The village will most likely
be destroyed tomorrow.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
So please get away quickly.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You're okay knowing
that you'll be killed?

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] Perhaps it was
always my fate to die here.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
But I regret nothing.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
In the end, I met Majic and
Salua, people who cared for me.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Every time. Every damn time.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
I meet some woman who
injects her ridiculous drama

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
into my cruel joke of a life!

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
Here's a little piece
of advice for you.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
When you're asking for a favor,

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
you really should try to
be more persuasive.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.770 position:50% align:center
You haven't convinced me.
I'm denying your request.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
But... But why?

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You're just a kid.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
You can't even break
free from my grip.

00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.864 position:50% align:center
I won't leave you to die.

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I wanna keep Fiena safe!

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.379 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Seriously?

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
You're gonna let some random
girl drag you into her issues?

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.343 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Well, that is what
my master would do, right?
