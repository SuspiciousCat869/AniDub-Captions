Whoa there!

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
This is it, huh? We've finally
reached Fenrir's Forest.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
They say you can find
any kind of beast here

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.816 position:50% align:center
or any kind of lifeform,
for that matter.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.319 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Eh. And we're going
all the way through it?

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center

[MAJIC hums]

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hey, Majic. What song's that?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.248 position:50% align:center
You've been humming
it this whole time.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Oh. I'm just
making it up as I go.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hm? Well, it doesn't bother me,

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
but you're still
keeping watch, aren't you?

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
Obviously, yeah.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:59.721 position:50% align:center
[humming continues]

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
♪ La, la, la, I disturb thee,
cage of la-la-light. ♪

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I love keeping watch.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Mm... Hey.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
I keep getting the feeling that
somebody is looking at me.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center
It's probably in your head.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
I bet it's because of that
ranger station we saw nearby,

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
but there's nobody
around here except us.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Really? Are you sure?

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid. I see you didn't
even notice I was here

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
until my boot landed
on your face.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
So does "keeping watch" mean
watching her bathe, huh?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
But I wasn't!
I've been sitting here

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
facing the forest
the whole time,

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
I swear!

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
Look, there's no way you're
gonna fool me on this one.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.261 position:50% align:center
I know all about that trick.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
The medium for Sorcery
is sound, not just words.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
You were just casting
a light refraction spell

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
and you used your humming
to keep it going

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
so you could get a peek at
Claiomh around that rock.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
Eh. Guess I'm busted, cause
there's no fooling you, Master.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
I am not your Master,
you got that?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
I'm just the guy who you're
paying to teach you Sorcery.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
Don't go thinking that
makes you my apprentice,

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.368 position:50% align:center
because it doesn't.

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
No, I'm pretty sure
that it does, actually.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Majic? Is someone there?

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
Never again, are we clear?

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
I can never tell what's
gonna set that guy off.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Majic! Are you
really keeping watch?

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.427 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Everything's fine!

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
You're s'posed to watch,
not look! You pervert!

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
Gather at my command--

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Are you kidding?

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
It took me three years and four
months to even grasp the basics

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
and I trained with the best
Sorcerers on the continent!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
This kid's had two weeks and
I never taught him that spell.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
He figured out how to manipulate
it like that all on his own.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
[groans]
If he keeps up that pace,

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
he'll become a full-fledged
Sorcerer in less than a year.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC groans]

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
If you ever try to peep
on me again, I'll kill you.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
You've got it all wrong! I only
looked because you called me!

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
you couldn't even manage

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
to dodge a few rocks.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
Well, some of us
can't use Sorcery

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
to help us in a fight, okay?

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hm. Too bad.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
but at least you've got
the look down, right?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
Dressed in all black like
a mini-Orphen wannabe!

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
'Course I am.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
He is my master, so why
wouldn't I dress like him?

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Yeah, but don't
you think borrowing his shirt

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
is taking it a little too far?
I swear, you're such a kid.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
It's funny you should say that
when you're wearing my jeans.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.791 position:50% align:center
So what does that say about you?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Heh! Well I'm at
least enough of an adult

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
to wear the same size
pants as you do!

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
That's a lie.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
I saw you altering the length
when you put them on earlier.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH laughs]

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] So, how long will it
be before we get to Tafrem?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Once we're through the forest,

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
it'll be about three more weeks.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
What kind of a place
is Tafrem anyway?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
Would ya stop shoving me?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
Tell me everything you
know about it, Master!

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
There's not all that
much to say.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted
to be a Sorcerer.

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
I dreamed of seeing Tafrem and
the Tower of Fangs in person!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN sighs] Tafrem's not
worth dreaming about.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
And neither is the Tower,
for that matter.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
Or even being a Sorcerer.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
Hey, why are we pulling
off of the road?

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Look, over there. That's a
ranger station, right?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It's best if we try
to keep out of their sight.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
If they know there are
Sorcerers in the forest,

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
they'll report it to
the Kimluck Church.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
But why the Kimluck Church?

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Both they and the Royal Family

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
are in charge of
guarding this forest.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
I don't know too much
about all that.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
They don't have very many
members in Totokanta.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
They're a powerful organization,

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
about as influential
as the royal family.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
That's right and they also
don't take kindly to Sorcerers.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Even now, you say.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Even now, you do not know?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
[FIENA gasps]

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
Ah, crap. I brought
more than enough food

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center
to make it to Tafrem
without stopping,

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think that I'd
have two extra mouths to feed.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.236 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] That's why I told you
we should have gone around

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
the forest and headed
straight for Alenhatam.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
That would've been the best
place for us to stock up.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, and eating
this much canned food

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
can't be good for your health.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN groans]
It's not like I want to,

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
but I don't have a lot
of options, now do I?

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
There's no way I'm eating
those chemistry projects

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
you call cooking.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
Don't you talk to me that way!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
Okay, everybody calm down.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
You two can relax here while I
go find us some food. Cool?

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
Well don't go too far from camp.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I'll be fine. It's not
like I'm gonna get lost.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
I'm not a little kid, you know.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hm?

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay, I'm definitely lost.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
Master's gonna give me
so much hell for this.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.954 position:50% align:center
And whenever I do anything
that gets him angry,

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
he always makes me do,
like, 500 squats.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
[hissing]

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Oh, crap, giant snake!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
Uh, Gather at my command.
Shield of Amber!

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I kinda can't believe
that actually worked.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.350 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
You're a Sorcerer.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.397 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] You were using Sorcery,
weren't you?

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh. Mm-hmm.
So who might you be?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
And what are you doing out here?

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] What about you?
Why are you here in the forest?

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh. I'm just...

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
I came here to find some food to
bring to my master, that's all.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
For your master?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Uh....

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
Well, at least he's the guy
who's teaching me Sorcery.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
Ah. That means you're
still an apprentice...

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so? I'm still in training,

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
but someday, I'm going to
be an awesome Sorcerer

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
just like my master!
Well, hopefully. Maybe.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
--[FIENA giggles]
--Uh?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Hey, your clothes...

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
Are you a shrine maiden,
by chance?

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
Mm. How can I explain?

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center

As I have said,

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
I am under the control
of the power of this forest,

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center

for you or your master.

Sorry, but I don't get it.
Anyway, um, what's your name?

My name is Fiena.

Fiena, huh? It's a
very pretty name.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center

What about yours?

Oh, it's Majic.
Good to meet you.

not on the maps.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
It's called the Sacred Heart.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
At least, that's the
name that we use.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center

a village nearby?

If I bring my master,

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
will they be able to spare
a bit of food for us?

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but you can't come.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL] Because your

This forest belongs to us

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
and right now you're
trespassing on our territory.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
There's a penalty for that and
it's even higher for Sorcerers.

the Kimluck Church?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
Dragons. Like that
one on your pendant?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
This creature doesn't exist.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
It was invented to symbolize
the power of Sorcery

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
and Dragons are the beings
who can use that power.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
Oh. Then are you a dragon?

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Come on, you don't call
human Sorcerers dragons.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
What are they even teaching you
kids in school these days?

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
I hated history class.

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] So you're saying
Dragon worshippers

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
hate Sorcerers,
but Dragons use Sorcery?

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
There's a long story
behind that.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
It began in the days
before Sorcery.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
That was the age of Magic.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
A power that only
the Gods could wield,

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
but six beast races were
able to adapt that power

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.519 position:50% align:center
for their own use.
That's the origin of Sorcery.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
And those six races that
learned how to use this power

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
later came to be
known as Dragons.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
The most intelligent among these
races were called the Nornir,

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
or Weird Dragons.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
They're also known
as Celestials.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
But their entire race was
female, so they had to mix

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
with the human population
to produce heirs.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
And their descendants are the
people we now call Sorcerers.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
Which means that
Sorcerers like you

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
are half human and half dragon?

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Basically.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
But when humans
started using Sorcery,

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
the Celestials became enraged.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
They were afraid of letting
us share in their power.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
They said that we had stolen it
from them just as they stole

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
Magic from the Gods.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
The Celestials convinced
the rest of the humans

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
to worship the Dragons.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
They turned these human
followers against the Sorcerers

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
in an attempt to eliminate them.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
These were called
the Sorcerer Hunts

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
and they continued until a
few centuries ago when

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
the Celestials vanished from
the Earth entirely except

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
for the immortals known as the
Aureors, who created Sorcery.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
There are still
people practicing

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
the Dragon Faiths today,
as you see,

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
but they're less hostile
towards Sorcerers now.

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
Outwardly, at least.

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
In a place this
secluded, though...

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing they've hardly
ever encountered

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
a Sorcerer in the flesh.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Just our luck.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
We stumbled into a place
where I'm totally unwelcome.

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Okay.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:09.816 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] What is that?
It's like a pillar of light!

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
It's Sorcery, without a doubt.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
But whatever's using
it isn't a human.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Could that be? A Deep Dragon.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
A Fenrir!

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Wait, a Dragon?
Right here in front of us?

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS]
O master....

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
--Claiomh!
--I'm ready!

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Listen. You need to run back
to the closest ranger station.

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
Tell them what we
saw and stay put.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
I'll take care
of Majic. Got that?

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Why do I have to leave?

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Shut up and go!

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
All right, I won't argue.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
But you're gonna
owe me for this, okay?

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Majic is probably
being kept in that tower.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
I have to get there
without the Deep Dragon

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
or the villagers noticing me.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.306 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL]
Who's there?

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
I see. Are you the Sorcerer?

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
I was surprised to
see a Dragon here.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.441 position:50% align:center
And now there's a gun.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
You realize they've been
outlawed by the Royal Family.

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
I am the law in this forest.
I'm the leader of the Sacred

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.909 position:50% align:center
Heart and I answer
only to the Dragon!

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.832 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee.
Sword of Light--

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
[SALUA]
Hm!

00:20:55.672 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
[VILAGERS shouting]

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
Now, flow thus. Angel Breath!

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
That's enough outta you.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It's... the Deep Dragon.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[MACDOUGAL gasps]
Our Master is here!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
Master. Please. Speak to me now.
Silent dragon. Warrior.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
Tell me why you stare!

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
This man is surely him.

00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:37.172 position:50% align:center
He who has come to
take what is yours.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
I can hear it. His voice.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.678 position:50% align:center
O... O Master!

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS]
O Master...

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:50.435 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Stop... this... voice!

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] Then, in order
to protect that which is yours,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
you would take my
powers for your own?

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:40.462 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] This detour is taking
way longer than I thought

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
it would, but Father did
always tell me that

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.341 position:50% align:center
slow and steady wins the race.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Is this really the time?
