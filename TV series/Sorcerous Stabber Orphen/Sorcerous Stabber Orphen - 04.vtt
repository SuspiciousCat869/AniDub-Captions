00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.388 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The continent's
greatest nexus of Black Sorcery,

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
the Tower of Fangs.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
It is known far and
wide as the crucible

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.770 position:50% align:center
in which the strongest
Sorcerers are forged.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] But even among
these elite pupils,

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
the talent of Azalie
Cait-Sith stood apart.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
She was known as
the "Chaos Witch,"

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
but Krylancelo proudly
called her his sister.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.458 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.378 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.547 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I give up!

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.007 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Really?

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to think you
like getting thrown around.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] You would need to
do a lot better than that

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
in a real fight.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
You only beat me
because I let you.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
If you'd lost, you would have
been in a bad mood all day.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you're
ready for another round?

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Don't you dare.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Tish.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
Cause trouble while
Master Childman is away

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
and it's a hundred lashes
with the whip for you.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
Understand, Azalie?

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
Come on, Leticia, cut me
some slack. We're family!

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Hm? Wait.
He left? Where'd he go?

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] He went with
Corgon to explore some ruins.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.396 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
And Forte?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] He's in the
library ignoring his duty

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
as class monitor, per usual.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
What about everybody else?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
Heartia and Comicron
are both late.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
Just like they always are
when Master is gone.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
I don't think
they'll ever learn!

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
You're not in any position
to be complaining about them.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
They don't cause half
as much trouble as you!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
Fine, I get it already.
I'll be good, I promise.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
Wait. Where are
you going, Azalie? Hey!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
Every time, I swear.
Honestly, what a pain.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
You got that right.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
Yup, That's how it's been with
her ever since we were children.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
Just like you!

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
You heard me, so don't even
think about giving me trouble!

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:50.939 position:50% align:center
Sure, got it.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
I'm going to patrol the tower.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Hmph. 'Cause it's
not like you ever

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.363 position:50% align:center
get in fights
with Azalie, right?

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
Listen to this, Krylancelo!

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
So, I met this girl from
one of the other classes.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.538 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Heartia. Don't you
go getting ideas either.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
I hereby forbid you from
approaching any of the tower's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
female students!

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.002 position:50% align:center
What? No fair!

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Every time you're
caught within five meters

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
of a girl, I'll hang
you upside down

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
by your feet for ten minutes.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
Please, Tish.
Where's your heart?

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
You always drop
whatever you're doing

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
to hit on any girl
who walks by.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
Well, excuse me for
falling in love too easily!

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON]
We're in big trouble!

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
Help me, you peons!

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA grunts]

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
Please refrain from
running in the halls.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Good deeds are
always so satisfying!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA gasps]

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You still breathing, Comicron?

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Hey, what's got
you all worked up?

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON gasps] You both need
to come with me right away,

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
and witness the terrifying
glory of my latest creation!

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.554 position:50% align:center
Hold it!

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A groans]

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
Another one of your
androids is on the fritz?

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
This is a huge problem.
Shut the thing off already!

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
Um. I can't.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
What do you mean you can't?

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.079 position:50% align:center
I'm not the one who activated
the mechanical soldier

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
mark-two prototype. It started
moving around on its own!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON]
Hm?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
Are you saying it was a ghost?

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
I don't know what it was,

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
but we're in trouble
if we don't stop it!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll deal with it!

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
O Wind!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA grunts]

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It could
destroy the whole school!

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
Embrace my surroundings,
Dancing Bronco!

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Hark, O Light!

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
Whoa, Tish?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
What's going on here?

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
You'd better have
an explanation!

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
That was awesome, Krylancelo!

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
You cut down my latest prototype
like a hot knife through butter!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
I see why you're called the
Successor of the Razor's Edge!

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
Oh, it was no
big deal, honestly.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Hm. Successor of
the Razor's Edge.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Krylancelo! Come on. Wake up!

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
Time to go. Let's move!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.925 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You still haven't said where.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
I didn't even know we had
someplace to be today.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
You'll see when we get there.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
Long trip, huh?

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
You got that right!

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Hm. Wait, Raindust?
Oh, yeah, that's today!

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
You finally remembered.
That's right. Today's the day.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
It's time to visit their
gravesites again.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
It's all falling apart.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
A total ghost town.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
Once the bandits took over,
it was inevitable.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
But that's the way it goes.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.654 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] There's the orphanage.
I barely recognized it.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.657 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me too.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
When we were little.
That place was my castle.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN giggles]

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE, LETICA chuckle]

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center
I remember that winter day
when you first showed up

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
at the orphanage, it was
freezing cold just like this.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
You were still a little baby.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
They had you all wrapped up
in a pink blanket,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
and I'd never heard
anyone cry so loud.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh.
What a pretty pink color.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tish, come quick!
The baby's here!

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
Hurry up! You're gonna miss it!

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
If I remember right,

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
Tish was helping with
the laundry out back.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
I don't think she had any
idea that you had shown up.

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
They made a big fuss over you.
Sorcerer kids are special,

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
so everybody always gets excited
whenever a new one appears.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
Says the Sorcerer kid.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you
remember it that clearly.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
It was such a long time ago.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't remember
very much from back then,

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
but my memory from when
you first showed up

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
will always stick
out in my mind.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
'Cause, really, there's no way
I'd forget the day when I met

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.491 position:50% align:center
my adorable little baby
brother for the first time!

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
I see. Then what about the
day they came to take you

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
and Tish away to the Tower?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
For some reason, I don't
remember that nearly as well.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that you do?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie! Tish! Come back!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Uh... Mm-mm.

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
Ah. Not so much, no.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
Then why bring it up,
ya little goofball?

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Next year,
it'll be Tish's turn.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
Azalie? Where'd you go?

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
Azalie?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

[grunts]

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
Everywhere we go, she figures
out how to make trouble.

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
 And it's Azalie.
She could've gone anywhere.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
Maybe she stopped for a nap
in an abandoned house.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center

Krylancelo.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.519 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Who's there?

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
Your sister... is here with me.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
If you want her back,

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
you must return
to the orphanage.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you're gonna
make demands,

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
you can at least tell
me who you are first!

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.909 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
I would advise you to hurry.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
If you do anything to Azalie,

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let you
get away with it!

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It's still quiet.

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Are they setting
an ambush for me?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
This is my only weapon.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
Before anything else, I need
to confirm that Azalie is safe.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
All I can do right now is...

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.909 position:50% align:center
Where's my knife?

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.252 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Guide my path,
Deathsong Starling!

[gasps]

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Where could they be hiding her?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
I need to find Azalie!

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.857 position:50% align:center
This can't be real!

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
You found me.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Where's Azalie?

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
Azalie, can you hear me?

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.123 position:50% align:center
Was that really... her head?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
What you've seen is the truth.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
It was... the truth?

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
But that...
that means Azalie is...

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
Damn you. You're gonna pay!

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
What...? What is this?

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
How can she be attacking me
without moving her body?

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN]
How pathetic.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
I expected more
from you than this.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Huh? I think my
opponent is a mental projection.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
And that means...

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
...the only thing keeping me
from attacking her is myself!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN] If this is the
best you can muster,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
then you'll never
be able, uh...

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
You truly never had the
strength to protect your sister.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I don't know if
this building will survive

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.599 position:50% align:center
what's about to happen.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN] Are you listening?
Answer me, Sorcerer!

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:40.148 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I have to close
my mind and erase myself!

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN] Whoa, holy crap!
Hold on a second!

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.527 position:50% align:center
Now, I crush thee!

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center

Primordial Silence!

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN gasps]

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.994 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
He actually won.
I couldn't defeat him.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I failed her.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
I wasn't strong enough
to protect her!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Hey, Krylancelo!

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Huh? Ah!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
Azalie?

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
But I... I-I saw--

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
Here. It's time for
us to head home.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE giggles]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] So that's it.
I see how it is.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
You're so cruel!

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
That was a dirty trick!

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:02.981 position:50% align:center
What was a dirty trick?

00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb!

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
You always tell me mental
projection is dangerous.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
Then you use it
for a cheap prank?

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
You sound kinda upset,

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
and you're looking a
little beat up, to boot.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone's been
giving you a hard time.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Oh, also. I might not have
mentioned it before,

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
but the spirits of my
ancestors haunt this town.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN growls]
Yeah... right!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
And I guess dropping wet rags
and buckets on people's heads

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.173 position:50% align:center
runs in the family.
I'm sure they're all so proud!

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
And now that I think about it,

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
the other day when
Comicron's android

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:35.180 position:50% align:center
started moving on its own...
That must have been you!

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
You were mentally
projecting yourself

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
with your White Sorcery!

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
You always take your
jokes way too far!

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. I found
this on the ground.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts] Did you?
What a strange coincidence.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
You happened to stumble
across my knife.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
I don't know how you haven't
gotten tired of doing things

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
like this. Seriously,
you need to grow up.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
At the very least,

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.127 position:50% align:center
you could apologize
instead of playing dumb!

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
--Do you have any idea how--
--Hey, thanks.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to know you worry
about me. So, thanks.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Don't try to change
the subject! Apologize!

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Come on, it's getting late.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
If we don't hurry, we're gonna
be sleeping under the stars.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
Like that's my fault!
You do this every time!

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
Whenever you run
out of comebacks,

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
you turn around and walk away!

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
I get it.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:35.990 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Don't brush me off!

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
Listen. The next time you find
yourself in this situation--

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
Really? You're gonna
do it again?

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
Just hear me out.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Next time, don't give
up the search, no matter what.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
Come find me.

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Why did you spare me?

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Because, he wanted you to live.

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
No. You're lying.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
Childman had been trying
to kill me himself!

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Think.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
Why would he take the risk of
coming for you personally?

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.125 position:50% align:center
Because... he wanted
his own body back.

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:32.088 position:50% align:center
He was the one who let you take
his body in the first place.

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
He had the power to stop you.

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
But what he really wanted was
to save you with his own hands.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
That... can't be.

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I wanted to show
him that I was a woman

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
worthy of him.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.904 position:50% align:center
I'll leave here and get
those years back.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Ow!

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Shh! He'll find us!

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that would be awful.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
How long have you known
we were back here?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
From the beginning.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, CLAIOMH]
Uh?

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
After I fixed up the mansion,

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
you offered me a free carriage
to take out of Totokanta.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
That was the tipoff.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
Impressive!

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.680 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no joke!

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
And even if I dumped you
in the middle of the road,

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.684 position:50% align:center
you'd find a way
to sneak back on.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH, MAJIC]
Yup!

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:29.729 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN sighs]
Guess I'm babysitting now.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
Well, you did say that you
would teach me Sorcery,

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
and then you skipped
town without even

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
coming back by the inn,
which was really rude.

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
I'm not traveling for fun.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
But anyway, I cleared
all this with my father.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Me, too! Or I left my
mom a letter, at least!

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Now that
I think about it,

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
why would you want to
come along anyway?

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.793 position:50% align:center
'Cause I really
wanna see the world!

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:55.213 position:50% align:center
Go places I've never been,
meet interesting people,

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
and learn everything
about everything!

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
He, he. And I've got a powerful
Sorcerer as a bodyguard!

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
So that settles that.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
I never actually agreed

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
to let either one of
you come with me.

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
I can pay you by the month.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
And I'll do the cooking.
I'm way better than you'd think.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
Whoa. I didn't know you
could cook, Claiomh.

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Wait, you two know each other?

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH chuckles]
Didn't I tell you?

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
Majic is three years younger,
but we're in the same class.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
And both of us are
members of the school's

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
Soldier's Club, too!

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
Back me up, Majic.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's all true,
and she orders me around a lot.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
Don't talk about me
like I'm the bad guy!

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Let's see, north is that way,

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
so I guess that puts us
right about here, yeah?

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
Okay. So where
are we going now?

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
To Tafrem.

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.222 position:50% align:center
Tafrem, huh?

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
Hey, the Tower of Fangs
is in Tafrem!

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
But first, we have to pass
through Fenrir's Forest.

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I'm so excited
to become a Sorcerer!

00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:42.088 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] But you'll be
making a lot of enemies.

00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:44.424 position:50% align:center
The royal family,
the Kimluck Church,

00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:46.885 position:50% align:center
and the race that
dwells in the forest.
