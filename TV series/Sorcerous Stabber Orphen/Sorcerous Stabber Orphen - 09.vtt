00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50% align:center
So. Anything to report?
Did you encounter our killer?

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
The assassin is Krylancelo.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
But at the same time, he's not.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
What does that mean?

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
There were two of him.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
The first looked no different
from the day he left.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
The second, I brought back.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.738 position:50% align:center
He looked about
five years older.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, he's all yours.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.705 position:50% align:center
So he has a doppelganger.
Is that what you're telling me?

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
I don't know who he really is or
why he would disguise himself

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
as Krylancelo from back then.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
And how do you see us
faring against this assassin

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
in a fight?

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] No one in the tower
would be a match for him.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
He's just as powerful
as our master expected

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.096 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo to become.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
The Successor of the
Razor's Edge.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Hm!

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.955 position:50% align:center
Now tell me who in
the hell you are.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
Like I said, I'm Krylancelo.
I'm the person who

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
Master Childman dubbed
"Successor of the Razor's Edge,"

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.755 position:50% align:center
and the only one who
he personally trained

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.341 position:50% align:center
in the secret arts
of assassination.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
There's no way you're
who you say you are.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.056 position:50% align:center
I never killed people. And the
same was true five years ago.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
I told you that I'm Krylancelo,
I didn't say we were the same.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
Then you shouldn't
be calling yourself

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
by my old name and
wearing my face.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Did they do you any good?

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
You're a failure who betrayed
every expectation placed on you.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
You couldn't be the Successor
of the Razor's Edge.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
Just a coward afraid to kill.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
So you left and
abandoned your name.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
I took it and became
what you couldn't.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:34.255 position:50% align:center
I am the only Krylancelo now.
I'm your potential realized.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
I exist to carry out
the will of one person.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Who is that?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Who do you think?

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
It's the only
person who matters.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
You know who that is.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.236 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO chuckles]
Well, see ya.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Wait! Hold on!

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center

[MAJIC]
Where's Leticia?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
She left for the tower
and hasn't come back.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
And Master turned down breakfast
and walked out the door.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
I have so many questions for him
about the Tower, and a lot more.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
Like, who's this Krylancelo
that Leticia was talking about?

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
I'm going out for a bit.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Where to?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
To look for somebody!

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
There's obviously
something bothering Orphen,

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
and I'm his trusty sidekick,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
so that means it's my job
to figure out what it is!

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Five years ago,

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
I left the Tower of Fangs
to search for Azalie.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE growls]

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
But my search went nowhere.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
I knew I couldn't come back, so
I became a loan shark to get by.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] It's all my fault.
I wanted to save her.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I'm going to
get those years back.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Getting those years back.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
Is this what you meant, Azalie?

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
Sending someone to
kill authority figures

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.648 position:50% align:center
using my name and my face?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
What are you after?

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
Where Black Sorcery is
purely physical in nature,

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
White Sorcery works on
the target's mind.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.708 position:50% align:center
Take this to heart.
There's only one true defense

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
against the power
of White Sorcery.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
And that is to fortify your will

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center

you a birthday present.

That's so sweet!
Thanks, you two. Truly.

You came at the right time!

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
Kids, I'd like you to
meet my friend Krylan--

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, he's from the Tower!

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
That's right. He and I trained
in the same class together.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
He was in the Childman Class?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
And now these two are
training under me.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
This is Tifis and his
little sister, Patricia.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
They're still early
in their training.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
I've been letting them
stay at my house.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
So you ended up an instructor?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
My name is Orphen.
It's nice to meet you.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
Orphen?

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS]
Wait a sec.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
I heard those two dwarves
talking about an Orphen,

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
but they're not Sorcerers
like you, are they?

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
Did you say dwarves?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
Yeah, apparently they
saw you show up here

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
and decided to come
in after you.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
And then they were all like,

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
"We're super hungry and
you gotta feed us!"

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
They seemed pretty sketchy,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
so we locked them up in
the shed just in case.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50% align:center
That was a good call.

She won't be getting back
to the tower till next week.

remember our promise?

The one that Azalie
came up with?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
We all agreed that if any one
of us was going to spend our

birthday with anybody else,

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center

secret from the others.

made any other plans.

even put their name on it,

but that's about it.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] He can't touch
his classmate, Corgon.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA scoffs]

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Forte.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
He has access to all
kinds of information

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
through the Childman Network.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
More knowledgeable and
connected than most of us.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
But in terms of Sorcery,
he's no match for me or Azalie.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
What's this about?

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
It's training.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
She's showing us where we
have room to improve, I guess.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Is this all you
two could manage?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50% align:center
Well, It shouldn't
come as a surprise

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
when you're up against the best
hand-to-hand fighter we have.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
It started as a three-on-one,
but she slammed me into the wall

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
and took me out
right off the bat.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Was there something you needed?

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you wanna go a round.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time, and it
couldn't hurt to get your body

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
moving and shake the rust off
once in a while, don't ya think?

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
A generous offer, but it
could actually hurt quite a bit,

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
and I'd rather leave
with my ego intact.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Master!

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
Remember.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.587 position:50% align:center
Training at my house
this afternoon, Krylancelo.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.630 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes sir.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
He's the only person master ever
invites to train at his mansion.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
Well, he is the Successor
of the Razor's Edge.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Krylancelo.

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:25.310 position:50% align:center
He's strong, fast, and precise
with his movements.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
But he's too naïve to
be a great fighter.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
So why would Master saddle him
with such an important title?

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Your moods are as unpredictable

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
as mountain weather.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
And what does that mean?

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.455 position:50% align:center
I just can't help but
notice something's been

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
bothering you all of a sudden.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
How many times do I
have to tell you

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
not to read other
people's minds?

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
I thought you were so cute
the way you used to be.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Mm! How can you not cringe

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
when you hear yourself say that?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
Listen. My answer hasn't
changed, it's not gonna happen.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
But my feelings for you
haven't changed either.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
Ugh. That's enough.
The issue here is Krylancelo.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
Azalie's training
has made him soft.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you tell he was
completely off his game

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:11.773 position:50% align:center
when we were sparring?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
I know you won't like this,
but it's important you hear it.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
Hear what?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.615 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] He let you smack
him around in training

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
because if he fought back
in earnest, you would be dead.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.078 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
That's how it's always been.
If he really wanted to,

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
he could crush you before
you knew what hit you.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
And he knows you couldn't touch
him at his full potential.

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
So he holds back.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
He's protecting you,
and that's the truth.

00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
So, why are we out here?

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
I feel like we've
done enough sparring.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
Gimme all you got.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
Beg your pardon?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
I said come at me like
you wanna kill me!

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.568 position:50% align:center
What's going on, Tish?
You're acting weird.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
Am I? Maybe the angels
talked me into it.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
It's hard to miss now that
he pointed it out to me.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
Hard to miss?

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
You're moving just
enough to keep

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
your vital points
out of my reach.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.221 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
Which means that Forte was
telling me the truth earlier.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
Back on your feet!

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
What are you saying?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.856 position:50% align:center
You can dodge as
much as you want,

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
but I'm gonna keep coming at you

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.443 position:50% align:center
until one of us
lands a clean hit.

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Don't do this.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
If you wanna end this
battle right now,

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
then you need to show
me your full power!

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA, ORPHEN grunting]

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] When he's forced
into a real fight,

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
it's obvious why he's called the
Successor of the Razor's Edge.

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.477 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Come in.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Hey Tish.
I had a question for you.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
That brooch.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
Oh, what's this say?

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
"To everyone's guardian angel."
I think Comicron wrote this.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Huh? He did?

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
I never knew.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
Everyone had their
eyes on you, Tish.

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
What the heck are you doing
here, you little miscreants?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
We're keeping watch!
Ya wanna fight about it?

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
--For what?
--For the assassin!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.941 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait, you guys too?

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Orphen asked us
if we could help him out.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
Orphen asked you?

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so deal with it.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
Now stow the sass and
get us something to eat!

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
I don't take orders from you!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN] Then I'll order
for myself-- Yoink!

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hey, gimme my wallet!

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] What is it you
wanted to talk about?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
Ah, that's right. It was
something about the assassin.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA sighs]

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
Do you have any thoughts on
the other Krylancelo's motives?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
It seems like most of the
Tower is out of commission.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.094 position:50% align:center
Besides the Childman class,

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
no one seems to be
in fighting shape.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
True, and now we're
down to Forte and me.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
Comicron died in an
accident two months ago.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Heartia is in
Totokanta for work.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:44.861 position:50% align:center
Corgon's a total mystery,
same as always. And Azalie.

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] But the real issue is
Master Childman disappeared.

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
It's been two months since
anyone heard a word from him.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Stop the coach.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Order has broken down
since he left.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
There's been a ton of infighting
between the classes.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
He left a void at the top and
everybody rushed in to fill it.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
Someone even slipped
poison into Forte's teacup.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
They didn't get him,
but he chose not to report it.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
He wanted to handle it himself.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
He thought that would help
him get things under control.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
That's how Master
would have done it.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.829 position:50% align:center
Then it seems the other
Krylancelo showed up

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
and started killing off Elders
in order to clear a path

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
for the person who would
become Master's successor.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
They've been able to evade
the Childman Network,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
and they're still
hitting their targets.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
There are only two people
who could do that.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
It's either Childman... or me.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.516 position:50% align:center
Well, which is it?

00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
You're saying that either
my kid brother or my Master

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
is trying to kill the elders?

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
The reason your kid brother
left in the first place

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
was that he wasn't
capable of killing.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
That fact hasn't changed.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
You can't mean it's Master!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
No, it couldn't be.
He's never coming back here.

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA gasps]
You know something, don't you?

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Man, this is a good
club sandwich!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.587 position:50% align:center
Stop snacking and
start searching, dwarf!

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
Hey, you first, jerk!

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
--Uh?
--[drumming]

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH, VOLKAN gasp]

00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
It's a Dragon Faith group.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
Guess this town has some, too.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
--[gasping]
--It's the assassin!

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center

--[DORTIN, VOLKAN gasp]
--[thudding]

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] You can't go quiet now
after everything you just said!

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
Five years ago, I lost the only
family I had ever known.

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.012 position:50% align:center
But I waited here and
did everything I could

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
to give you a home
to come back to.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
When Forte told me the
Childman Network had spotted

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo approaching,

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
I was sure you'd come to
take revenge for Azalie.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
But when I went to stop you
and take you into custody,

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
I realized that something
was going on.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
I saw Krylancelo,
five years older,

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
fighting another Krylancelo
who hadn't aged at all.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
Too bad. We were just about
to get to the fun part.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
But I won't fight both of you.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo is under my custody.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
Go ahead, he's all yours.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
I had no idea what to believe.
Which was the real you?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
Had you become a killer?
You would never do that, right?

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
The other me you saw.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
That's the guy I would have been
if I had stayed at the Tower.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
That Krylancelo was the one
Childman had always wanted

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
me to be.

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
The one people would call the
Successor of the Razor's Edge.

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Hey, Master!
Somebody just kidnapped Claiomh!

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
We didn't have a
chance to react!

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
The assassin came outta nowhere!

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
What the hell were you doing?

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
You told us to go find the
assassin and we did,

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
ya hot head! Then we saw
him carry her off

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
into that Kidman guy's
huge mansion!

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
What Kidman guy?
Wait, do you mean Childman?

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
Who is this assassin anyway,

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
and why does he
look like Master?

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Five years ago,

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
he was one of the top
Sorcerers at the Tower of Fangs.

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:43.850 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo was on track to
join the Thirteen Apostles.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
Wow, he was good enough for the
court to take notice of him?

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
They called him the Successor
of the Razor's Edge

00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
because Master Childman
was grooming him

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
to take his place at the tower.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
He must have been an incredibly
powerful Sorcerer, then.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
He was. But then
he left and became

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
the man who you
know as Orphen.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.536 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Okay, I'm lost.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] The assassin
is a stronger Krylancelo,

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
the one who stayed at the Tower.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
What's worse, Orphen's Sorcery
has gotten much weaker.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.629 position:50% align:center
Now he's trying to
lure me into the open.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]
Let me help you, Master!

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
If you go with him,
you'll only get in his way.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't let
him go by himself.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
This is my duty as his student!
I owe it to him to at least--

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Don't be stupid.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] If this guy's as
strong as you say he is,

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.603 position:50% align:center
can Master really
take him on alone?

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Orphen? Definitely not.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Then that settles it.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
He needs backup,
so I'm going with him!

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That's enough
out of both of you!

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
There's no time for this.
I'm going now.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
And I'm coming too!

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be fighting
the assassin, aren't we?

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
We called them Stabbers.

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
Sorcerers who underwent special
training at the Tower of Fangs

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
to become silent killers.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
You don't think...

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't have
killed Claiomh, would he?

00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
No. I'm sure she's still alive.

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
After all, he needs
her for leverage.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
I'm the one he wants dead.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
He's trying to use her to bait
me into coming after him,

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
and if he killed her now, I'd
have no reason to play along.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
But do you have any idea what
his ultimate goal might be?

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
And why is it that he would
suddenly show up now?

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
Good questions.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Well... a lot of big things
have been happening lately,

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
right before this
guy showed up.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
Tish still hasn't found
the life she wanted.

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.043 position:50% align:center
And I'm not sure if
my life is my own.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
I know there's an assassin
with the same face as me,

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
but it could be that
I'm really the imposter.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
The other one might be
the true Krylancelo,

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
and I'm just a cheap imitation.

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I'm gonna bring Claiomh back.

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
I'll settle things with my other
self and put an end to the side

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
of me that you didn't know.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Master always told
us that the paths of the

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.964 position:50% align:center
three goddesses
would never intersect.

00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:46.134 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] The three goddesses
of Past, Present, and Future.
