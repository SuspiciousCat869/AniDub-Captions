Huh?

Where'd you come from?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.847 position:50% align:center
[UOAR]
I was here when you came in.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.765 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Master Uoar Curlaine.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.978 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to know you haven't
forgotten who I am, Krylancelo.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
I came here to find Hydrant.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
Why would Milan be here?

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
As you know, he's no longer
a member of this class.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
And you know his
report was a lie!

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
That's how things work here.
Tish and I didn't kill anybody!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
Hydrant did that himself.
He waited until we were gone.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
I fought off the Dragon Faith
followers, but he murdered them.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
I have no good reason to
believe either of your accounts

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
over the other.
Don't waste your breath.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.594 position:50% align:center
is what my class saw
in the aftermath.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
By the time we reached them,

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
your assailants
were all quite dead.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
Turning a blind eye as always.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
Here's something you
can bet your life on.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
If you lay a hand on Tish or
that boy I brought with me,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
you're going to learn firsthand

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
what it means to be
hunted by a Stabber.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
You know better than
to forget who I am!

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
Nobody at this Tower would
forget you, Krylancelo.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.993 position:50% align:center
You were Childman's
crowning achievement,

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
the best of his many
accomplished pupils.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
Even a powerful
Sorcerer like Hydrant

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:25.043 position:50% align:center
didn't stand a
chance against you.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.962 position:50% align:center
And that was what led me
to realize my error.

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
I'd left a weapon of
terrifying power

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.550 position:50% align:center
where Childman could reach it.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.052 position:50% align:center
But lest you mistake my meaning,

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:37.263 position:50% align:center
I am more than willing to
destroy that weapon myself.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
And there would be no easier
time to do so than right now,

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.185 position:50% align:center
in Childman's absence.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
Forte's been trying
his best to avoid me.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
He can't stand getting
help from others.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
Well, I turned in
my application,

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
so it wasn't a total waste.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm? It's nothing.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
But lest you mistake my meaning,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center

the tower by the end of the day.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
How did this happen?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
Someone jumped
down from the roof

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
and stabbed Claiomh with
some sort of finger attack.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
With their finger?

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be okay. It's really
nothing to worry about.

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
You see 'em?

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS]
They were wearing a mask,

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
so we couldn't get a
good look at their face.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
Though, I'm pretty
sure the attacker

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
had on one of the
Tower's battle uniforms.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center

like a Stabber.

[LETICIA]
Then what?

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS]
They ran off. Toward the city.

For what? They'll escape!

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center

You can't go chasing after them!

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.643 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] I know you want
to find them, and we will.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
But the Elders definitely
won't let it slide

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
if you cause any
trouble in the city.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
I don't care about that.
Even if--

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
Why won't you listen
to what I'm saying?

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
Let me handle this.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
Look after Claiomh
while I'm gone.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.661 position:50% align:center
They're likely an assassin
from the Tower.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
I think I can handle
some third-rate Stabber

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
who had to ambush
a defenseless girl.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
They're not getting away.

strong, Tish, but--

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
Follow the plan.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Tsk!

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Let's get going.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
You got it. Come on.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] You can leave,
but Tish stays here with me.

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
It can't be!

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
No way. You're alive?

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Ordinarily,
I'd let Tish figure out

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
how to get out of
this mess herself.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
But this is a little different.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA gasps] It's you.
How are you here, Azalie?

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Fall back.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Tish!

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Tish!

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.934 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
What happened?

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA grunts]

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
You're up.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
So you're the one that
saved me back there, huh?

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
Guess I owe you.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Uh-huh.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
You know what?
It's funny, but for a moment,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
I actually mistook your
voice for Azalie's.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
Is Claiomh all right?

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She's resting.
How are you feeling, Tish?

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
When I found you,
you were already--

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
I mean, you were hurt pretty
badly, but I did what I could.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
I got there soon enough
to reattach your fingers.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
But I'm sorry.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
I couldn't reconnect the nerve
endings or get rid of the scars.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
Oh... If that's all it is,
then I'd say I got pretty lucky.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
Can't wait to get my
hands on those bastards.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Enough of that.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.582 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo. Promise me
you won't go after them.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
And let them get away with it?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Even after they almost
murdered you back there?

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
I know you're angry,

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
but getting revenge won't
accomplish anything.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
And I'd rather lose two fingers
than lose you again!

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
Then what the hell do
you want me to do?

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center
Get in touch with Forte.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
I don't know exactly what the
Uoar Class is aiming for,

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
but they made a mistake by
trying to kidnap me.

00:12:56.234 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
That alone should be enough
to put an end to them.

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
Forte has support amongst
the Tower elders.

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
He can have Hydrant removed,

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
and a spotlight put onto Uoar
and whatever unsavory things

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.331 position:50% align:center
he's been up to
with his students.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
He's been looking for an excuse
to take down Uoar for a while.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me, okay?

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
I bet if Comicron were here,

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
he'd be able to heal
my fingers like new.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] After he found
out Comicron died,

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Corgon left the Tower without
saying a word to anyone.

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Before I knew it,

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
almost everyone I'd
known had disappeared.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
If you're truly worried
about me, then promise me.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.617 position:50% align:center
Don't do anything foolish.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
Don't go chasing after revenge.
Don't leave the tower.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
Promise me you won't
leave me alone again.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.426 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Where are you off to?

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.719 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh?

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.601 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Azalie.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
Out with it!

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
Well, you're in a mood.
I'm just here for a chat.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's about time
I visited Tish's place.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Enough games!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
You know, if you're
already this worked up,

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.579 position:50% align:center
you'll never defeat
Uoar Curlaine.

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
O Radiance.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
You're going to the tower.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
To send out a messenger, right?

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Even if someone were
sent out, they wouldn't make it

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
very far before running
into an "accident".

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Uoar and his cronies
are on the final stage

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.976 position:50% align:center
of their plan.
It's about time for them

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
to start tying up
all the loose ends.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
No way. They're staging a coup?

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.401 position:50% align:center
Quite a few elders who
opposed the Uoar Class

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
have had "accidents".

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
They've already started
removing threats.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
But don't worry, I eliminated
a bunch of the elders

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
who had been secretly
supporting them.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.496 position:50% align:center
So that's why you're
hunting down Elders.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec.
So you knew about Uoar?

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
With Master Childman gone,

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
there is a power vacuum
in the Tower right now.

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
The Uoar Class is trying
to use that to take over.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
Ah, and we're in the way.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it seems their biggest
headache right now

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
is how to deal with
the Childman Class.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
They're searching for
one of Master's belongings.

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
Until they find it, wiping us
out isn't their top priority,

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
because they need us alive to
help them locate where it is.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
It's the Browning Family's
World Transcript.

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
The what? Browning...

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
[MASKED MAN]
I only want one thing.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
The Browning Family's--

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
And why are they
looking for it?

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] According to
the legend, over a thousand

00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
years ago, one of the gods,
Swedenborge, went berserk.

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
He tried to kill off
the other gods

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
so he alone could
rule over creation.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, Swedenborge became
known as the Magic King.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
Since the Kimluck Church
worships the goddesses,

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.559 position:50% align:center
the legend of the
Magic King is taboo.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
But, he left behind a book
containing secret knowledge.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Over the years,

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
that text became known
as the Transcript.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
[UOAR] Once the Kimluck Church
found the book, they hid it.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
Locked it away in the
World-Seeing Tower.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
Eventually, they decided
to place the Transcript

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:37.122 position:50% align:center
under the custody of one
of the heads of the Church.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
The Browning Family.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
But over time, the
Transcript left the hands

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
of the Browning Family and found
its way into the possession

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
of the Dragon Faith worshippers.

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
And the last known
owner of the book

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
is none other than... Childman.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
When I helped Master
with research,

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
I was basically his secretary.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
That's when I learned
about the Transcript.

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
[UOAR]
According to the legend,

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
that text contains
countless secrets.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
It is a marvelous artifact.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
And the true source
of Childman's power.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
Listen well. We must obtain
the Transcript for ourselves.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
And with it, the Tower
will be ours completely.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
That explains why the Uoar
Class has been attacking

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:22.000 position:50% align:center
the Dragon Faiths, and why
they tried to kidnap Tish.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
They want to use her
as a bargaining chip.

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
Do you know where this
Transcript is supposed to be?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
What will you do if you find it?

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
Put an end to this! I'm done.

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
If Uoar wants the damn book,
I'll just give it to him!

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
That won't work.
Don't be so naïve.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] We don't have
time to debate this.

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
Uoar and his students are
going to attack tonight.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
There's no turning
back for them.

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.651 position:50% align:center
They've essentially
betrayed the Tower of Fangs

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
by trying to kidnap Tish.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
If they allowed you to report
it to the upper echelon...

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Then the Uoar Class
wouldn't last a day.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
They'll be coming after you.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.915 position:50% align:center
Tish, Forte, and your
friends are in danger.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
And now that Hydrant
knows I'm still alive,

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm on that list too.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
They realize tonight is their
last chance to get rid of us.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I know we can handle
anything that Uoar throws at us.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
But can Tish?

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Didn't know you still cared.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
And here I thought you had
forgotten about your family.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]
Of course I care.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
Sorry. That was rude
of me to say.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
I'm at fault, too.
I should be around more.

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
You know what you have to do.

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
"Stab" Uoar Curlaine.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
Tish asked me to do
the exact opposite.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
It's because she doesn't
understand you.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm always right
in the palm of your hand.

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.177 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
You make it sound like
I'm not helping you out!

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
You've gotten stronger
after facing your old self

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
and your moves are much sharper
now, like they used to be!

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
Now you actually
match your title.

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.235 position:50% align:center
The Successor of
the Razor's Edge.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
This is Nornir's Legacy.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
It allows its user to teleport.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
To answer your question
about the Transcript,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
I gave it to your
student to hold onto.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
My student? Majic has it?

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Uoar won't stop looking for
the book until he's found it.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
So keep it safe.

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Well, see you at the tower.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Give me a break.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
As if you could ever actually
understand how I feel!

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
If you did, then you wouldn't
treat human lives like nothing!

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what's wrong
with him?

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
I really hope he didn't
wake up the neighbors.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've seen that
woman somewhere before.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
But I can't remember where.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
Hey, Claiomh.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Fancy seeing you here!

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
You seem to be feeling better.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your Sorcery,
I'm just fine!

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
It's like I never got
hurt in the first place.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
I don't mean to pry,
but are you heading out?

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.233 position:50% align:center
I wanna go, too!

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
Come on! Please?

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
I'm like the best side-kick
you could ask for!

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Are you even listening?

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:39.823 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Master.

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
Majic, where did you
get that book from?

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
Huh? The other day, while we
were inside Childman's Manor.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
--[MAJIC gasps]
--[LETICIA] Majic!

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
Uh! Coming!

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
It was just on the floor.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
Of course it was.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.887 position:50% align:center
She put it there 'cause
she knew you'd pick it up.

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
Hey. The clock's ticking.
Let's go.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I'm coming, too!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, CLAIOMH]
Huh?

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you think I
could help with something.

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
Well, you two aren't much help.

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
And you'll probably
hold me back.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC sighs]

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] But that's all the more
reason to bring you along.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.117 position:50% align:center
A Sorcerer as gifted as
me could probably stand

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
to have a bit of a handicap to
even things out. It's perfect.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.582 position:50% align:center
Having to take care of both of
you will keep things exciting.

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
Plus, it'll be a good
learning experience.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
Where exactly are we going?

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
Why am I even asking,
you won't say.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
To the Tower.

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, CLAIOMH]
Huh?

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.469 position:50% align:center
Wait, why are we
going to the Tower?

00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
Is it some kinda' super-secret
mission or something?

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go track down those
bastards who attacked Tish

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
and get some revenge.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, CLAIOMH]
What?

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Majic and I might
not be able to do much,

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.357 position:50% align:center
but we're with you! We'll do
whatever it takes to help!

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
You can't just chase
after those guys alone.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:59.486 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Of course.
With your help, I'm not alone.

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
--[CLAIOMH] Huh?
--[MAJIC] What's that?

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
So get ready.

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.992 position:50% align:center
I'll be relying on the two of
you to help me out tonight.

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:40.128 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] I'm all pumped up!
If at first you don't succeed,

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:43.089 position:50% align:center
try, try again. But with way
more violence this time!

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:44.841 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I'm not sure who
I'm more worried about.

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
The Uoar Class, or you.
