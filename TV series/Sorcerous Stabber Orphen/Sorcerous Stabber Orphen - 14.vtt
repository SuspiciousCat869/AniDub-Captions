00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.013 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] You've gotta
be kidding! That's not fair!

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.432 position:50% align:center
You can't just leave us behind!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
You're trying to do everything
by yourself again!

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
Didn't we help you out
a bunch last time?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Yeah. But this is different.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
it's "different"? We can--

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
Didn't you say it was your
dream to become a Sorcerer?

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
The Tower is where you belong.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is, but...

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about him, Majic.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
Because Orphen's trusty sidekick
has always got his back!

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.622 position:50% align:center
You're staying too.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
I don't remember ever
asking for a sidekick.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH grunts]

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
Wait. Master,
where's your pendant?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, uh... It's around.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
So tell me. Where exactly
are you going, Krylancelo?

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN ehxales]
To Kimluck City.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.730 position:50% align:center
You know how much the Kimluck
Church hates Sorcerers.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
They won't let you just
waltz into their capital,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.525 position:50% align:center
it's too dangerous!

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
If you want me to answer
any more of your questions,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.492 position:50% align:center
find me in Kimluck.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.167 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] But still,
that's where I have to go.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
This brings me back.
The Sword of Baldanders.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Master. It's my fault.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] This is the
entrance to Fort Basilitrice.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
I remember reading about it.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
The Basilitrice was the first
Mythical Beast that served

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.276 position:50% align:center
the goddess, and in
order to fight it off,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
the Celestials built this
fort centuries ago.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
Seems you've done your research.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I?

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
If the Tower wants to send us
out to find Nornir's Legacy,

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
then I might as well learn
as much as I can.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
Plus, if we find it,
there's a good chance

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
we can uncover some artifact or
a powerful lost Nornir Sorcery!

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
According to the records,
the gods sent the Basilitrice

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
as divine punishment.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
They wanted to destroy
the Dragon races

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
that had stolen the
secrets of Magic.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] The Basilitrice
was a fearsome creature

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
that caused untold devastation.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
It could kill with
just its eyes.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
A single glance bringing death.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
In its wake, the land
became barren,

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50% align:center
and anyone who fell victim to it
was erased, both body and soul.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
The only way the Nornir could
overcome that threat...

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
...was to build
Fort Basilitrice.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Your task is deciphering
the runes inside.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
You got it, Master!

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
With me here, we'll find
an artifact in no time!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
Azalie, slow down!

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
O Radiance.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] These ruins are
often filled with traps

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
and other hidden dangers.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.865 position:50% align:center
So you must ensure
that you follow

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
my instructions
to the letter.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
I will, Master.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
I never would have guessed
that there were such

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
enormous ruins hidden
right under Alenhatam!

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] All Nornir ruins have
essentially the same layout.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Uh?

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] There should be
some Wyrd Glyphs around here.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.972 position:50% align:center
Tell me if you see them.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Over here! I found them!

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
These state the location
of a secret room!

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
And they even say
how to open it!

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
Nornir Wyrd Glyphs often
have traps set within them.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
Take precaution not
to activate anything.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50% align:center
Master! We can't just
walk away empty handed!

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to find
anything if we're too afraid?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
Besides,

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
you said yourself that it was up
to me to decipher the Glyphs!

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
--[AZALIE gasps]
--Be careful!

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
This is where the runes sent us?

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
An altar.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
And statues of the Dragons?

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Sister Istersiva? Wait.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] She's the head
priestess who created

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
the World-Seeing Tower.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
That means, this place isn't
just some secret treasure room.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
That's right. We've found
Istersiva's grave.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Are you serious, Master?

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] She disappeared
after the war between the gods

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
and the Dragon races.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
It appears that this is
where she lived out

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.262 position:50% align:center
the last of her days.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Is that a Killing Doll?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
Now Bind, O Chains!

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
O Light!

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE gasps]

00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
O Light!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Hark! O Light!

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
Let us search for
the artifacts now.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:40.812 position:50% align:center
Yes sir!

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.529 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Mm?

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Hm.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
"Be disarmed, my foes."

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
Looks like this
ring has Sorcery

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
that protects its
wearer from harm.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
The crest of the moon.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful!

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
"I am both the beginning
and the end,

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
just as the beast called Time." 

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Look at these runes.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
It says, "The Sword
of Baldanders."

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
I guess that's
its name. Must be.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
There's more.
"The Soon-Another."

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
I think I get it now.
This is amazing.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
It could transform its
user into anything.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
I'll need your help deciphering

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
the Activation Sorcery.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
Sure! And then we can see
if it still works or not!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
I should take care of
that part alone.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
All I need you to do
is analyze the glyphs.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
I can do so much more!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
Just give me a chance
to prove it!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center
Come.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE grunts]

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
Why can you not trust me
with anything, Master?

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
[clattering]

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The desk! Azalie...

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON] It looks like
someone's in a bad mood.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Is there ever
a time when she isn't?

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
I really hope nothing
bad happened

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
while they were in the ruins.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Think she got
scolded by Master?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
With how often
she gets lectured,

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
that wouldn't bother her at all.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
Maybe they got into
a fight or something.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
Nah. Knowing Azalie,
she probably tried to pull

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
some stupid prank on Master
and he finally snapped at her.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I bet she sent him an exploding
box that swings a steel ball

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
at your head while shooting
out a bunch of nails.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
I've actually gotten one
of those from her before!

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and since you
were next to me,

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
I ended up getting
twelve stitches!

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
She's not crazy enough

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.611 position:50% align:center
to pull something like
that on Master, right?

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
Who knows? But there's a
reason she's "The Chaos Witch".

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
If you looked up
the word "irrational",

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
there would just be
a picture of Azalie.

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Hark, O Light!

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, COMICRON, HEARTIA yell]

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groan]

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
So, Krylancelo, do you want
to end up like them?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
We were just saying that Master

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
was lucky you went
along with him!

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad we agree.

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Azalie. If you want
Master to trust you more,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
you have to learn
to control yourself.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
You just can't be so impulsive.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
I'm quite aware of that,
thank you very much.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
You have no idea.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
As a child, I was
horribly injured

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
because of out of
control sorcery.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
I almost died. I would have
if Master hadn't been there.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE sighs]

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
It takes but a single mistake.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
For a Sorcerer to lose their
life, or be permanently maimed.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
Every attempt to research
the Celestial Artifacts

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
is a foray into
the unknown.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Now do you understand?
The reason Master works alone.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
It's to make sure that
you don't get hurt.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
You think I'm afraid of
something like that?

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
I'll show him I can do
more than just translate.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
How's it coming along?

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
I'm still trying
to go through it.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Alright. Just be careful.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] It's time to prove
to Master that I can do 

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
this by myself.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
Activation Sorcery.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
"I am both the beginning
and the end.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
Just as the beast
called Time."

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
"I am The Soon-Another."

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
"I am both the beginning...

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
[shouts]
...and the end."

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] "Just as the
beast called Time."

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
Azalie!

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE shouts]

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN gasps]

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE groans]

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.100 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Because of my mistake,
everything changed.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
There's nothing I can do
to go back and fix it.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
But, Master had plans to use
this sword for something.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
I'll find out what.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Hey, think these
would look good?

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
Aren't those Tish's clothes?

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Mm-hm. They were.

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
But she said I could have 'em,
and I figured with these

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
I'd finally be able to
dress like your sidekick!

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think it'd be
a nice change of pace!

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
How many times do
I have to tell you

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
I'm going to Kimluck by myself?

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Krylancelo.
Your carriage is here.

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
--[CLAIOMH gasps]
--Thanks for everything.

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
Wait! I haven't finished
getting all my stuff packed!

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
The Tower of Fangs.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.508 position:50% align:center
So this is where Master grew up.

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
Why did you want to enroll
at the Tower, young man?

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
Well, to be honest.

00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe I could be a bit
more like Master, or something.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
I wanted to train here with him.

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
Master promised me that
he would teach me Sorcery.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
So much for promises.

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he hasn't told you,

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
but the elders have labeled
Krylancelo a traitor.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
They made him their scapegoat

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
and accused him of plotting
treason against the alliance.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
So that's why they're
making him leave the Tower.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Well, the penalty for
treason is death.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
--[MAJIC gasps]
--Though, fortunately, the

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
Childman Class does still have
enough supporters within the

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
upper echelon and I was
able to argue for leniency.

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.311 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC whimpers]

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
At least they
won't kill him now.

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC sighs]

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
Instead, he's been
banished forever.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
They've stripped
him of his titles.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
He can no longer wear
the Dragon emblem.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm? Oh, that's why.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
With that, Krylancelo is
truly on his own.

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
Even before this, he always
did everything alone.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Hmph.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your Master
must seem that way to you.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo was around your
age when he left the Tower.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
I think about that day often.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.641 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Leticia and I both tried
to convince him to stay,

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
but he had already
made up his mind.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
As a Sorcerer,
he was exceptional.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
But he's always been too naïve.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
He has no idea just how
deeply his departure

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
affected the rest of us.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
Majic. Do you see the
box in front of you?

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Yes, sir.

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Open it.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
Is that?

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Did you know that
symbol doesn't represent

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
the common Dragon races,
but in fact,

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Sorcerers wear it to honor
a far greater Dragon.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
According to legends,

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
it's the only one of its kind,
known as the "True Dragon."

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
The pendant you're holding.
It used to belong to Krylancelo.

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
What about the other one?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] You'll need to ask
your Master about that.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.277 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor.
Bring those to him.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
Of course, by doing as I ask,

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.615 position:50% align:center
you'll be ruining your
future at the Tower.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
The elders wouldn't
stand for it.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
A traitor carrying the
emblem of the Tower.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
You'd be found guilty
by association.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
Also, before you leave,
I'd like to address your answer

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
about why you wanted
to enroll here.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
Frankly, I found your reasoning
to be extremely flawed.

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
But--

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
I know first-hand how
lonely it feels

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
when your friends suddenly
disappear on you.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
You feel unwanted.
But that's not the case.

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Did Krylancelo ever
say he didn't want you

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
to come with him?

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
Of course not. But with
your flawed reasoning,

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
you decided that he didn't
want to fulfill his promise.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
You should ask him yourself
why it was he left the tower

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
five years ago.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
He can't have gotten far.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm! Thank you very much!

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH chuckles]
And that's the last one!

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
So you're just gonna come
no matter what I say?

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
Obviously!

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tish. Take care of
the brat for me, will ya?

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Master!

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh? You're back?

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:31.027 position:50% align:center
Yes! Thank goodness,
I thought you left already!

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
Go back to the Tower, isn't that
what you always wanted?

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought my dream
was just to study 

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
Sorcery at the Tower of Fangs.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
But I realized something.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
I don't want to become just
another Tower Sorcerer.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a Sorcerer
like you, Master!

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm coming with you!

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
Wherever you go, I'll follow!

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.678 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Heh. Ah, damn it.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
Fine, you can tag along
if you want to!

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
Ha! Great!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, one more thing!

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:05.729 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh?

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Forte asked me
to give this to you.

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
From Forte?

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
These are...

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's your pendant!

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:15.864 position:50% align:center
Well that's surprising.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.741 position:50% align:center
Presents aren't
usually his thing.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
That's...

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:24.414 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] He said that you'd know
who the other one belonged to.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
Find me in Kimluck, won't you?

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
See ya. It's been fun.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
You're making it sound
like we're never going to

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
see each other again!

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
Always remember, Krylancelo.
You can come back any time.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
No matter what, this place
is still your home.

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.940 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
You hear me?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
Thanks for all your help.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] The Chaos Witch.
Azalie Cait-Sith.

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
She could change the world.
Or just do nothing.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
What's your plan, Krylancelo?

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't underestimate
the Kimluck Church.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.346 position:50% align:center
Look at all this great stuff!

00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
You didn't steal those, did you?

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know this
is some of the food

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
Tish gave me for our trip!

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
Let's have this for dinner!

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
I've got the perfect
recipe in mind!

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:55.523 position:50% align:center
You won't need a recipe!

00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
I'll just eat straight
out of the can!

00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
But it's been a long time

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
since I've gotten to
show off my skills!

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you, you better
not try to cook me anything!

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Fine, whatever!

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.494 position:50% align:center
If Orphen doesn't want any,
that just means more for you!

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
No, thank you!
I'll eat from the can too!

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:11.873 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Don't be shy!
Come on, you love my cooking!

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I really don't.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Just leave the damn food alone!
