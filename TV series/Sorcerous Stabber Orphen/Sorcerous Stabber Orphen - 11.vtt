That was pretty intense, Master.

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
At least 20 laps around the

Did Claiomh just pull a hit-

Face me, you coward!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.997 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Aww, but I
used my best recipe!

My "One Shot One Kill Stew!"

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
I must have messed
it up somehow.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
Where could I have
gone wrong this time?

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Uh! Hey!

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.261 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you screwed
something up too, huh?

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
Oh... Indeed. A lot of things.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
Well that's a relief!

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
The way my life has been going,
sometimes it feels like I'm the 

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
only person in the world
who ever makes mistakes.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center
Ha. Wanna hear something my
Master used to say to me?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.987 position:50% align:center
The difference between a single
success and a single failure 

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
doesn't amount to much.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
All that matters is what
you make of the outcome.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Right now, I'm looking
back on one of my past failures

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center
and hoping I can
turn it around.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.380 position:50% align:center
Thinking back. Dad once
told me the same thing.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:33.051 position:50% align:center

thing I want from you.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
The location of the Browning
Family World Transcript.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER A]
I-I don't know.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
I heard it was lent out
a few years ago.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
Lent to whom?

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER A]
They said it went to Childman.

You're in a high-ranking

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
The Tower will have
your head for this.

[gasps]

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
[MASKED MAN A]
I only want one thing.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
The Browning Family's--

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center

I hope you're ready for another
one of Claiomh's specials!

Huh?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
Say hello to my

Uh...

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's wrong?

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
Come on, now.
You need your strength.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
See, I think eating that
would do the exact opposite.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
Master, is there a problem?

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Nah, I can dodge it for a while.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking
about the meatloaf.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.372 position:50% align:center
Who was that guy before?

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
He's a Stabber.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
--[MAJIC] Huh?
--Again?

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
A real one this time,
sent by the tower.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
Why do so many people
wanna kill you?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what did you do?

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
That is none of your business!

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.765 position:50% align:center

Keep it down, you two!

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
All I'm asking for is a peaceful
night's sleep in my own bed.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.818 position:50% align:center
After cleaning up your messes
for 38 consecutive hours.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN] Uh...
--[BOTH] Sorry.

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
You want to go to the Tower?

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
That's why Majic's here.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
He wants to enroll.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
But is this the time?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
I already took care of
the guy killing the elders.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.048 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] That's hard to
verify without a body.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
The body burned up.
My double was a Killing Doll.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
I've heard of them before.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
They're powerful
anti-Sorcerer weapons.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
Humanoid figures whose bodies
are engraved with Nornir runes.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
Completing the runes
brings the dolls to life,

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
and they use Silent Sorcery.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.360 position:50% align:center
She watched.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
She'd kept an eye on you for a
long time, just as you thought.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
And then she took control
of me. To test you.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
If that's true,

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
who was the one who found
and activated them?

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Uh...

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Azalie! Tell me why
you murdered the elders.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
Was it out of spite?
Why did the ranger have to die?

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
And why would you
drag Claiomh into it?

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
I never expected that doll
to start acting outside

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
of the orders
that I'd given it.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
I don't know how,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
but it seems the thing
developed a will of its own.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Sorry, but I don't know.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
If you're going to lie,

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
couldn't you make
it more convincing?

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
In any case...

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
Here. Mind reading this?

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo. Age 20,
Childman Class.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
Deployed on a secret
mission for five years.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
Guarantor is Leticia MacCredy,
also of the Childman Class.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.306 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
That's the latest record
from the tower.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
I made the update myself.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
Officially, you've never
been stripped of your rank

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
as a Sorcerer.

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
But if you do anything else to
upset the Tower, expect them

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
to skip the demotions and
send a Stabber after you.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Unfortunately,

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
it seems like they didn't
wanna wait that long.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.165 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] But in fact, they were
the three sisters no more.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
And I was able to converse
with them briefly.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]
Who said you could read that?!

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Hm? Wait.
This isn't my diary, is it?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Ow...

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
Ha! I got confused 'cause
it looks so much like mine!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
Like the one you've got
right there in your hand?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. Good point.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.023 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have figured
you'd keep a diary.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
I've had so many new experiences
since the day we left Totokanta.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
It would be a shame to
lose any of those memories,

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
don't ya think?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
Whaddya write?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Well, one day I wrote
about this delicious

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
Tower of Fangs gelato,

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
and I wrote another one about
Tafrem's excellent pudding.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.040 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC sighs]

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
So what's that raggedy
book you're reading?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:26.047 position:50% align:center
I haven't figured it out yet.
I can only read bits and pieces.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
But it says something about
the order of the world

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.845 position:50% align:center
being destroyed, or maybe
it means "transformed?"

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Time to head out, Majic.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Head out where?

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
To the Tower.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Then I'm coming, too!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
--No, you're not.
--[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
But it's the most important
thing in this whole town!

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
Just lemme go inside
a cultural icon!

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
It's a school,
not a tourist trap.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.488 position:50% align:center
I'll talk to Pat and Tifis.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'd be happy
to take you out sightseeing.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
You can all grab yourselves some
treats and make a day of it.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
Oh! That'd be great!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] The real Tower of
Fangs is right there behind me,

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
and there's a tiny gelato
version here in front of me!

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
Would you mind maybe acting a
little bit less like a tourist?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50% align:center
I wanna try a baked Tower.

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
But I can't decide if I want the
jam bun or the custard roll!

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN]
A tower fan?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
We've got just the
thing for you, Miss!

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
The official mascot,
Mister Tower!

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
Full disclosure,
he makes a lousy pillow

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
'cause of the shape of his body.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center
But he's quite usable as a hug
pillow or a draft stopper!

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
Hey! Didn't we lock
you guys in the shed?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50% align:center
Why haven't you left town,
you little creeps?

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN, VOLKAN]
Gasp!

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to do business

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
with you snotty little
kids around? Scram!

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
What do you think
would happen

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
if the two of you
ran into Orphen?

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN gasps] I guess that
means the magic loan shark's 

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
got the blonde running
surveillance for him.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
Let's blow this scene, Dortin!

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
--Got it!
--[VOLKAN] It's a solid product.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.630 position:50% align:center
Mister Tower's
gonna make us rich!

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
Maybe if they gave him
a more memorable name.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Well, originally this
place was called

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
The World-Seeing Tower.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
I'd never heard that.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS] The person who
created it was a priestess

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
to the Celestial Beings.
A woman named Istersiva.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
There's a quote of hers
you may have heard.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
"The answer to all questions
can be found here."

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Did anyone come looking?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
Well, they tried. Some members
of the upper echelon.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
It happened 40 years ago.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:18.201 position:50% align:center
They started a war with
the Kimluck Church

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
trying to find out what
Istersiva meant.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
Ever since then, the entrance
to the Tower's been sealed.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
The upper echelon?
What does that mean?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
The Sorcerers who run things
and give all the orders

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
at the Tower.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
Below them are the
various classes.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
They're the ones who
carry out the orders.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] You mean like
the Childman Class?

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS]
Right.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
They're the most powerful class,
they even have some influence 

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
within the upper echelon,
and that gives them a bit

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
of authority over the
rest of the Tower.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.899 position:50% align:center
It's a problem. A lot of people
feel the Childman Class

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
gets special treatment.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.695 position:50% align:center
Members of the other classes
tend to resent them for it,

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
so things can get tense.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
And now, they don't have
Master Childman to protect them.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
The hierarchy he'd
established is falling apart.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
All this drama because
one teacher bailed on them?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
But he was more than that.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
Master Childman was the only one
strong enough to keep a tower 

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
full of ambitious
Sorcerers in check.

00:11:23.058 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
I'm not sure it'd be wise

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
to enroll while
Master is missing.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
With everything going on,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
it's that much more important
for me to learn Sorcery.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
I wanna help, but if I can't
back Master up in a fight,

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
I'm just a burden.

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] If you're
really set on doing this,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
you need to tell Forte
what you just told me.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
He might let you enroll
in the Childman Class.

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Hey, Tish.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.088 position:50% align:center
Can you think of anybody who'd
be holding a grudge against you?

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
That some kinda joke? I'm a
respected member of society.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] So if someone
should happen to ambush us...

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
...then they're most likely
trying to get to me.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
--Wait!
--Did you say--

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
[horses whinney]

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC shouts]

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I knit thee thus,

Flow thus! Angel Breath!

[LETICIA gasps]

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
They've surrounded us.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
They've surrounded us.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
Dragon Faith followers.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Without Sorcery, how many of
these guys can you take out?

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
If I'm unarmed, I don't think
I can manage more than two.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
Weapons?

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] There are some
swords in the coach's box.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
You grab one of those.
I'm gonna take point.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
--Cover me.
--And me? I--

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
You do nothing.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Uh?

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, LETICIA grunting]

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] What's this?
My instincts. My senses.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
Suddenly, they all
feel razor sharp.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVERS groan]

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Amazing.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
I suppose that means
I'm done covering you.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
You should have said you
were gonna take them all out

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
on your own.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't have been nearly
as stressful that way.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER D grunts]

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
You probably suffered
some organ damage.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
Don't try to go anywhere,
and avoid breathing too deeply.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER D]
Shut your mouth, Sorcerer!

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
What was your reason
for attacking us?

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER D]
We're avenging our comrades!

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
But what are you avenging?

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
I don't remember giving you
any reason to hold a grudge.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
Wait, on second thought,
maybe I do.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER D]
You're an abomination.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't exist!

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
You slaughtered our people
like they were animals!

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
Slaughtered?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
No idea what he means.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] Demon Sword
of Puanook. Now, Strike!

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center

[ORPHEN grunts]

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
His head is gone.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
There!

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.948 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
I know you.

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:10.243 position:50% align:center
That's right, Krylancelo.
If you're not happy to see me,

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
I assure you the
feeling is mutual.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
I'm here to escort you.

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
Do you care to reminisce as
we proceed to the tower?

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] The name is Hydrant,
though I'm sure you remember.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Of course I do. But why'd
you have to kill him?

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'm not like you.
I do whatever needs to be done.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee...
Sword of Light!

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
You need to control your temper
if it's going to affect

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
your technique that much.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
But I must admit the power
behind it was impressive.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Had it hit, I would be
on the brink of death.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Speaking from experience.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Hm. But you were gracious.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
You left me with half
my face intact.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
After all these years, it would
be a shame to lose it now.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.808 position:50% align:center
Don't you think, Tish?

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
Hydrant of the upper echelon
came to escort us personally?

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
I guess that means I'm more
popular than I realized.

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
The Tower would like to extend
a warm welcome to you all.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
[VINBI] Welcome, I'm Master
Forte's secretary, Vinbi.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
Lady Leticia, Master requested
that you remain here

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
with this young man and
help him finish filling out

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
his enrollment paperwork.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
Follow me sir.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.656 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] So you're aware.
That man is spying on me.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
You mean your secretary?

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Good to see you still
know how to break the ice.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
It's been five years and that's
the first thing you say?

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
Then perhaps it's better
to open with a question.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
Was it you who
killed the elders?

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
No. Do you know Master
Childman's whereabouts?

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
But you certainly
wouldn't be willing

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
to answer either of those,
so I don't see the point.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
Anyway, about my secretary.
His name is Vinbi Stotall.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
Officially, at least.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
I hired him because I needed
someone with no connection

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
to the Tower.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
And he claimed to fit
that bill, but with a bit 

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
of digging, I discovered that he
had been expelled seven years 

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
prior for bad behavior.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
After which he somehow caught
the eye of Uoar Curlaine.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
And if Uoar found
some use for him,

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
then Vinbi is likely a
powerful Sorcerer.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.127 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt he's had
at least some training

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
as an assassin.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
Why keep him around?

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
Tish told me somebody tried to
slip poison into your teacup.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be more
worried about all of this?

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
Well, the members
of the Uoar Class

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
are the only assassins
at the Tower anymore.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
You remember training with them.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
Which is why you
should listen to me!

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
You know just as well as I do
that getting the Uoar Class

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
against you is one
of the fastest ways

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
to get yourself
killed around here.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
We're going to need to root out
everyone involved in this plot.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.784 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] You crossed paths
with Hydrant, correct?

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
Seems he was brought
into the upper echelon

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
while I was gone, but he was a
member of the Uoar Class, too.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
Last night.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
I found someone I'm pretty sure
must have been a Stabber

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.967 position:50% align:center
who broke into Tish's house.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
I see. Then the Uoar Class
was surely involved.

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
It must be them
making their move.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
They're trying to eliminate the
leaders of the Childman Class.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] On that subject,
we received a report

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
that several followers
of the Dragon Faiths 

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
were massacred on the
outskirts of Tafrem yesterday.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
Wait, massacred?

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
[DRAGON FAITH BELIEVER D]
You're an abomination.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.366 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't exist!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
You slaughtered our people
like they were animals!

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Afraid so. And that's
why I called you in alone.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
If Tish were to hear this,

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
her response would only serve
to disrupt things further.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.841 position:50% align:center
It's the official report
on the attack.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] High-ranking Sorcerer
Leticia MacCredy and party

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
were attacked in the road by a
mob of Dragon Faith followers.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.395 position:50% align:center
The party was able to ward off
the assault, but the attackers--

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:50.482 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
...were all fatally injured?

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:54.152 position:50% align:center
I testify that MacCredy and
party acted in self defense.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Milan Toram.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Milan Toram.
Also known as Hydrant.

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
It's all too convenient.

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
The Uoar Class clearly
arranged all of this.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
If Tish caught wind
of this report,

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
she would storm right out of
my office and make a beeline

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
--for their class.
--[door slams]

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.426 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Yes, something like that.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
Where'd you come from?

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
[UOAR]
I was here when you came in.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Master Uoar Curlaine.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:40.448 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to know you haven't
forgotten who I am, Krylancelo.

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
I came here to find Hydrant.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
Why would Milan be here?

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50% align:center
As you know, he's no longer
a member of this class.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
And you know his
report was a lie!

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
That's how things work here.
Tish and I didn't kill anybody!

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
Hydrant did that himself.
He waited until we were gone.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
I fought off the Dragon Faith
followers, but he murdered them.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
I have no good reason to
believe either of your accounts

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
over the other.
Don't waste your breath.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.730 position:50% align:center
The only thing I can be
sure of is what my class saw

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
in the aftermath. By the
time we reached them,

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
your assailants
were all quite dead.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Turning a blind eye, as always.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
Here's something you
can bet your life on.

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
If you lay a hand on Tish or
that boy I brought with me,

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.954 position:50% align:center
you're going to learn firsthand
what it means to be hunted

00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
by a Stabber.

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
You know better than
to forget who I am!

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
Nobody at this Tower would
forget you, Krylancelo.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
You were Childman's
crowning achievement,

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
the best of his many
accomplished pupils.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
Even a powerful Sorcerer
like Hydrant 

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
didn't stand a chance
against you.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
And that was what led me
to realize my error.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
I'd left a weapon of terrifying
power where Childman

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
could reach it.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:54.522 position:50% align:center
But lest you mistake
my meaning,

00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
I am more than willing to
destroy that weapon myself.

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
And there would be no easier
time to do so than right now,

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
in Childman's absence.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN ]
Hey loan shark!

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:41.504 position:50% align:center
You ever notice how everywhere
you go, you always run into 

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:43.131 position:50% align:center
somebody who wants you dead?

00:23:43.214 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Yeah, but what I don't
get is how I keep running

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:46.843 position:50% align:center
into you stupid dwarves!
