00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.262 position:50% align:center
[ELDER A]
Starting today,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
you will study Sorcery
as his apprentice.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Why him?

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.645 position:50% align:center
[ELDER A] We have rather high
expectations for your future.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
Your primary goal is
to surpass your master.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
And there's the Tower of Fangs.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.020 position:50% align:center
With Tafrem sprawling
underneath it.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
We made it! I'll finally get
to become a real Sorcerer!

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.859 position:50% align:center
At this rate, we'll get
there tomorrow.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.868 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] It seems
you knew to be on guard.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.620 position:50% align:center
News of my work
must be spreading.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
This is just one more step

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.545 position:50% align:center
in fulfilling my primary goal.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
Nothing will stop me from
completing my mission.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] Even if I have
to drown this city in blood.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.679 position:50% align:center
I won't rest until
the deed is done.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50% align:center
[SORCERER A] Did you hear
another elder was murdered?

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50% align:center
[SORCERER B] That brings
the number slain to five.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[ELDER B] Council Elders
are being hunted down!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
Soon enough there won't
be any of us left!

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
[ELDER C] It is your
responsibility to track this 

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50% align:center
mad man down! You have to find
him and bring him to justice!

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.079 position:50% align:center
[ELDER D] This is the biggest
crisis we've faced 

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
since the Tower's creation.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
Surely, they have some
overarching agenda.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
Do whatever it takes
to stop this murderer.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
Turn Tafrem upside down
if you have to!

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.053 position:50% align:center
This wouldn't have
happened if Master 

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.223 position:50% align:center
hadn't insisted on going
through with that mission.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
O Flames!

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
[COMICRON]
O Wind!

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:11.167 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
O Light!

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
O Chaos!

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
[FORTE gasps]

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Someone's here.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I should've known.
Hello, Leticia.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.702 position:50% align:center
Forte, is this report
completely accurate?

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
Is Azalie really dead?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
There are more pressing matters
that must be dealt with first.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
A fifth elder was
cut down in the street.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
I've been tasked with
finding the culprit.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
Another elder killed?

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
So that's what all the
buzz has been about.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.762 position:50% align:center
This assassin must be
extremely capable.

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
Luckily, we were able to
catch a glimpse of the killer

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
through my network.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
It's a slim young man
with black hair.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
He's likely a Sorcerer
from the tower.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
Furthermore,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Heartia uncovered something that
might be linked to this case.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
What did he find out?

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Before leaving Totokanta,

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
Master met with Krylancelo.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA gasps]

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
No one has seen or heard from
Master since that meeting.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
And at this point, I can
only assume the worst.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo.
What's happened to you?

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Killing the elders could
be his way of exacting revenge

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
on the Tower.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.965 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
it's our duty to stop him.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
We must get to him
before anyone else.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
We must remove this stain
on Childman's honor.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
Forte, you can't be serious!

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
You need to wake up. He's not
the boy that you once knew.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
[thudding]

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC pants]
Master!

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
You can run, but you can't hide.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh?

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
I'm sorry, Majic.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.876 position:50% align:center
I couldn't hear you
over the explosions.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
What did you say again?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]
Well. I said...

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
...that you could maybe try
making some human food for once?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hmm. Oh, yeah?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Ugh, not again.
Majic, jeez.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
When are you gonna
learn to shut up?

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC groans]

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
[RANGER A]
Let me get this straight.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.193 position:50% align:center
The three of you were
on your way to Tafrem

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
and stopped for lunch.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.573 position:50% align:center
He made fun of her cooking, so
she blew up part of the forest.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
That the gist of it?

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's right.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
According to the law,

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
I would have to report this and
hand you all over to the Church.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
But I won't, this time.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Thank you, sir.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.837 position:50% align:center
If the Church found out
you were a Sorcerer,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
you'd get beaten to death,
and that's if you were lucky.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Sounds about right.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Fortunately for you, I owe
the Tower of Fangs a favor.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
Let's both pretend
that I didn't see

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.225 position:50% align:center
or hear anything so I won't have
to fill out all this paperwork.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
[RANGER A] Just hurry back
to the Tower of Fangs!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
And don't get into
any more trouble!

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Where is it?

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps] Hey!
Hey, mister! What happened?

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
I didn't sense anything.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
How could he have been
murdered right under my nose?

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
It must've been an assassin.
But why target him?

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.340 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Who is the successor?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Who is the successor?

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Orphen's been awfully quiet.

00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Yeah, I wonder
what's bothering him.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
I asked earlier,
but he wouldn't say.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Look out!

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]
Orphen!

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[CLAOIMH]
We have to help!

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
We can't! It's too dangerous!

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:24.295 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
You can't even help yourselves.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Over there!

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I unsheathe thee.
Come now, Sword of Light!

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.015 position:50% align:center
I did it!

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.811 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee.
Come now. Sword of Light!

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH, MAJIC gasp]

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
Good thing Leki's here
to pick up your slack.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
So it was you.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
I heard rumors that a human
stole a young Deep Dragon

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
from the forest.
I'm surprised you pulled it off.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
And look who's up.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
You're okay!

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!
I was scared you died!

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.503 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I'm not ready to
kick the bucket just yet.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
And I'm guessing that you're the
bastard that ambushed me, right?

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
That was just a greeting.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect you
to be so weak.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
You got lucky, you punk.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
So. You're not convinced.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
I dance within thee.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
Heavenly Castle!

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
He teleported?

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
I get why you're so surprised,

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.402 position:50% align:center
but you shouldn't
let your guard down!

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.655 position:50% align:center
I strike at thee.
Spill forth, Glass Hail!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, MAJIC grunt]

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
Orphen! Majic!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center
It's nothing major,
we'll be fine!

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] I always heard that
deep dragons were powerful,

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
but I didn't think it could
negate my attack entirely.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
Listen Claiomh,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
you need to make sure that Leki
focuses on blocking his Sorcery.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
Master, what's going on?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I hate to admit it,
but the little fur ball 

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
is the only one powerful
enough to stop him.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
Nobody else has a chance.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Wait!
What are you talking about?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You heard me,
that brat's the real deal.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
His Sorcery is even
stronger than mine.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Relying on a dragon,
how pathetic.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.863 position:50% align:center
That teleportation Sorcery,

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
it was something
Childman came up with.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
It needs a special
formation to work.

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.787 position:50% align:center
How are you using it?
Who are you?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be
one of the Tower's best.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't see it.
You show a real lack of mastery.

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. Are you truly the
Successor of the Razor's Edge?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
It was you. You're the one
who murdered that officer!

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] I'm to return
you to who you were.

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
By any means necessary.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
If you're only after me,
then leave the others out of it!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
[both grunting]

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just give up?

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
You're fighting a battle we
both know you'll never win.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
Leki! Do something!
Anything! Please!

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Finally.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
You know, you really
should have listened

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
to what the weakling told you.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
If the Dragon kept defending,

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
I'd have no way of
dealing with its Sorcery.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
But while it's attacking?
Totally different story.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] It doesn't
matter how strong the

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
Dragon's Sorcery is,

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.020 position:50% align:center
it can't attack and
defend at the same time.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee,
Come Forward!

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
Sword of Light!

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, CLAIOMH gasp]

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
--[MAJIC] We're alive?
--[CLAIOMH] What happened?

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Too bad. We were just about
to get to the fun part.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
But I can't fight two of
Childman's pupils.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
We'll finish this later.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
Stop right there.
Krylancelo is under my custody.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, he's all yours.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Why does... he look... like me?

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
But how? There are two of you!

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
I'm sorry.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50% align:center
I don't think we've been
properly introduced yet.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
Next to you is Claiomh.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
She's the daughter of
some noble family.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
And this one is Majic.
I'm teaching him Sorcery.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
Fuzz ball over
there is her pet,

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
we picked it up on our
way from Totokanta.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
He's Leki.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
Yeah, anyway, this is Tish.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
She's from the Tower.
She and I go way back.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.773 position:50% align:center
Though I have to say,

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
you've changed a lot
over the past five years.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
You've grown up, Krylancelo.

00:12:58.153 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
The name's Orphen.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] So, this is where
you came from? It's huge!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Yeah. If you made
a list of the biggest cities

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
on the continent, Tafrem would
probably be in the top five.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A]
Stop for inspection!

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
My name is Leticia MacCredy.
I'm from the Tower of Fangs.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
These people are my guests.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
I'm investigating the
current situation.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
[GUARD A] Yes, Ma'am!
Please continue!

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.770 position:50% align:center
What's with all the
extra security?

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Recently, there's been a
rash of murders in Tafrem.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
A serial killer?

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
Who could do something
so horrible?

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
We can't be sure.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
But they've been targeting
the Tower's elders.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
But why go after them?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
Because those old geezers are
the ones in charge over there.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
They run almost everything.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.794 position:50% align:center
Well, if the murders are
happening in Tafrem,

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
why would they ever leave
the Tower of Fangs?

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
It seems like
it'd be safer inside.

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
Almost all the elders
live in the city, 

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
and having a house
is a status symbol.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
But, with a killer on the loose,

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
I bet they are holed
up in the Tower.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
We're actually just about to
pass by our master's house. See?

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.439 position:50% align:center
Childman's manor.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
[ELDER B] There hasn't
been any new information?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[ELDER C] Five elders
assassinated within two weeks!

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
It'll only be a matter of time

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
until the rest of
us are wiped out!

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
What if... the Kimluck Church
is behind all of this?

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
[ELDERS gasp]

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.380 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Forte's network
has been trying to catch

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
the one who's been
killing the elders.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
He's trying to set up something
similar to what Childman did?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Master's network
allowed him see any event

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
that happened on the
continent in real time.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
Forte's network isn't
as sophisticated,

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
it only tracks near the Tower.
But it's still useful.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
Has he had any luck in
finding out who the killer is?

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
He couldn't get a
clear look at his face,

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:04.195 position:50% align:center
but was able to get a
general description.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
You matched that description,

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.991 position:50% align:center
so Forte was almost
certain it was you.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh?

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.205 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] Heartia,
it looks like Krylancelo

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.458 position:50% align:center
has already arrived in Tafrem.

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:20.045 position:50% align:center
And we still haven't
heard from Master.

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
Were you able to
find any evidence?

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
Not yet. I haven't found
anything concrete,

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
but it seems unlikely
that Master's still alive.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
If he's dead, the only ones
who could've killed him

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
were Azalie or Krylancelo.

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:40.732 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] But he had already
taken care of Azalie.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
Master disappeared after
meeting with Krylancelo.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
I refuse to believe
this is a coincidence.

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.493 position:50% align:center
Nice place!

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
It seems like what you've wanted
ever since we were little.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
A home of your own.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] You're half right,
but it's not like I dreamt about

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
owning some building.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
I wanted to have a family
one day, not just a house.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
Um. I don't mean to be rude,
but do you not have a family?

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I know that's
way too personal.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
It's no problem. I don't.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
Most of the Sorcerers
at the Tower of Fangs

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
don't have families either.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
The Tower recruits
most of their students

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
from the nearby orphanages.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
I've told you I didn't
have a family, remember?

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] But, you're not exactly
what I'd consider the norm.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
What was that, you punk?

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, nothing at all.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
The Tower of Fangs' training is

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
particularly dangerous.
And every year the student

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
mortality rate is
incredibly high. No sane parent

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
would ever send their child
to a place like that.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.086 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Oh, cute cat!

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Say hello to Nora. Tish has
been watching her for me.

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
She's yours?

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
Well, duh! I missed
you so much, Nora--

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
[NORA hisses]

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
Uh. Glad to see you, too.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Most of these
rooms are already occupied

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
by my students, but this
one should be free.

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN "Should be?" It looks
like you just robbed a museum.

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
Well, it's this,
or camping outside.

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Aww, look at you!
You're missing a tooth!

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.704 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I think I was seven
when that was taken?

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Seven seems kind of late to
start losing your baby teeth,

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I don't
remember it all too well,

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
but I'm pretty sure I lost it
during combat training.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
Combat?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
It wasn't really
combat training.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
We just worked on the basics.

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.346 position:50% align:center
They would tie up both of our
hands and then beat us

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
with sticks over and over again.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.770 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] That sounds
more like torture to me.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.772 position:50% align:center
It's designed to
test your willpower.

00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
Do all black sorcerers have to
go through that same kind of

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
hardcore training
at such a young age?

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
Definitely not. The Tower
of Fangs is pretty unique.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Hey, Orphen,

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50% align:center
how come Tish's album has so
many pictures of you in it?

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
You're everywhere!

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
Huh? Because...

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
Well, she's the closest thing
to family I have left.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.837 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] We're from the
same orphanage. The three of us

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.964 position:50% align:center
have been together ever
since I can remember.

00:18:10.048 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
The three of you?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Me, Tish, and Azalie.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.178 position:50% align:center
Both of them took care
of me at the orphanage.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
We were as close
as real siblings.

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
And when we were all sent to the

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
Tower of Fangs, I was afraid
they would split us up.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.978 position:50% align:center
but we somehow landed in
the same class together.

00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
Orphen, you were such
a cute little baby!

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center
I can't believe that cute
child grew up to be you.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
Is it really so hard to
imagine me as a regular kid?

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
I guess I thought you'd
be a short version

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.740 position:50% align:center
of how you are now.

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You're leaving at sundown?

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.960 position:50% align:center
I'm heading over to
the Tower to tell Forte

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
that you're innocent.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, who knows what
kind of plan he'll cook up

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
to try and catch you.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
Why not just wait till tomorrow?

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
The sooner we can get them to
clear your name, the better.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
That way you don't have to hide
like some sort of fugitive.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.767 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad that
you've come back.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Tish. I can't stay.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
What is with you two?
Both you and Forte!

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
Why do men insist on
being so damn stubborn?

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I have to tell
Tish about what happened

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
with Azalie and Childman.
I can't keep hiding it.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
She deserves to know the truth.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
Because, he wanted you to live.

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
No. You're lying. Childman had
been trying to kill me himself!

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
Think.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Why would he take the risk of
coming for you personally?

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
Because he wanted
his own body back.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
You're wrong.

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
He was the one who let you take
his body in the first place!

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
He had the power to stop you.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
But what he really wanted was to
save you with his own hands.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
That... can't be.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I wanted to show
him that I was a woman

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
worthy of him.

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Tish'll probably cry.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
No. She'll go mad with rage.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
[NORA meows]

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
"You can't let yourself
wallow in negative emotion."

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
That's something Master
would have said.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
Even from the grave,
he's still giving lessons.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
The old man sure
was something else.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
I might just stay

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
and maybe one day I'll get
a house like this, too.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] Going back won't
be as easy as you think.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] In order to return
to the Tower of Fangs,

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
you'd need to prove to them that
you're still worth taking in.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
But you're just a shadow
of your past self.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50% align:center
You think the elders will
give you another chance

00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
after they find out you're
a second rate has-been?

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.226 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] And even if you
hadn't lost your powers,

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
no one's forgotten how
you turned your back

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
on the Tower five years ago.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
No matter what you do,
or how hard you try,

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
they'll never truly accept
you because you haven't fully

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
cleansed yourself from the
lingering stain of betrayal.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
Who the hell are you?

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
Who, you ask?

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.999 position:50% align:center
I'm someone who takes
the lives of others.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
So Krylancelo is a murderer,
is that what you mean?

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A] Exactly.
It should've been obvious.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
I'm done playing games.
Tell me who you are!

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSIN A]
I'm you.

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:54.356 position:50% align:center
Stop pretending to be some
sort of ghost from my past!

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:57.525 position:50% align:center
Why? You've thrown
away Krylancelo.

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
So, I'll take it, and you can
just keep being Orphen.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.128 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] What was it like
studying at the Tower?

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
Got any cool stories, master?

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:43.798 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If you can block
a hundred of my attacks,

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:46.134 position:50% align:center
--I'll tell you.
--[MAJIC] That's impossible.
