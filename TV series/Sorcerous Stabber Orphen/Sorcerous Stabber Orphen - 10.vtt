[TIFIS]
Majic. That was it, right?

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.227 position:50% align:center
I guess that guy went
off to fight on his own.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
"That guy"? You mean, my master?

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He's got some
reputation around here.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
You know that?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
I'm not trying to tell
you how to feel about him,

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:33.491 position:50% align:center
but there's some stuff in his
past that you might not know.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
When he left, someone from the
Tower followed him, right?

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.915 position:50% align:center
And Krylancelo nearly
killed the guy.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
Left him for dead in the road.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.210 position:50% align:center
He did that?

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS] Mm-hmm. The Thirteen
Apostles were looking

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
to recruit him.
He was on track

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50% align:center
to become the youngest court
Sorcerer in history.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
But then, in the end,
things took a different path.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.683 position:50% align:center
The Tower of Fangs had been
losing all of its most

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
powerful Sorcerers to
the Thirteen Apostles,

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
and the Tower's standing
was starting to decline.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.108 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS] That's when the elders
recruited a Sorcerer

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:11.029 position:50% align:center
named Childman, a prodigy who
showed up out of nowhere.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
His job was to seek out
children with high potential,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
take them in, and train
them into a team

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
of powerful Black Sorcerers.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] And my master was
one of those children?

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS] Yeah, you guessed it.
People referred to those kids

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.461 position:50% align:center
as the Childman Class,
and they were known

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:29.089 position:50% align:center
as some of the best
Sorcerers at the Tower.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
But Krylancelo's abilities
stood out among the class.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.011 position:50% align:center
They called him the Successor
of the Razor's Edge.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.097 position:50% align:center
And there is a
reason for that.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.057 position:50% align:center
His nickname refers
to the fighting skills

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.268 position:50% align:center
and assassination techniques
Childman passed on to him.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.603 position:50% align:center
With his natural abilities

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.146 position:50% align:center
and the secret knowledge
he'd learned,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
the Tower elders wanted
to keep him for their own.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
I have a theory about
what happened after that.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.364 position:50% align:center
I think Krylancelo was trying
to join the Thirteen Apostles.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
The guy who followed him
was likely sent by the elders.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.662 position:50% align:center
They met on the road
to the capitol.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.041 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER shouts]

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
[TIFIS] Krylancelo left
him in the road to die.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.715 position:50% align:center
And because of that, the
apostles refused to take him.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.009 position:50% align:center
My guess is he looked at
his situation after that

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
and decided he should
cut all ties to the Tower.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
Once he attacked the messenger,
the bridge was already burned.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.476 position:50% align:center
No, that couldn't be.
Master's not like that!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Huh...? Flip's old place, huh?

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
I guess it's still around.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Actually, I don't think I ever
walked through the streets

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
of Tafrem on my own.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
I always had somebody with me.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
They all expected great
things from me when I was 15,

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
but there was one hurdle
I couldn't get over.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
I was afraid to take a life.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] There will be
times when you're forced

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
to go head to head
with an opponent

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
who's more powerful
than you are.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
When you do, trying to
match your strength

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
to theirs will only get
you killed faster.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
You must match your
strength to their weakness

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
in order to prevail.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
Find a flaw in their
defense and attack it

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
without mercy or hesitation.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
You can mitigate a massive
difference in power

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
with a single point
of weakness.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I'm not sure any
of us could have lived up

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
to the expectations
you put on us,

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
but it seems like this other
Krylancelo pulled it off.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
He's the Sorcerer
you hoped I could be.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The truth is,

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
I'm about to be fighting a
better version of myself.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
There are no
weaknesses to exploit.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] All my flaws are
coming back to haunt me now,

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
because my opponent
knows every one of them.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
He's corrected
them in himself,

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
and improved on
all my strengths.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
It's the me you hoped for
versus the me who failed you.

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
Right, Childman?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA]
Where are you going?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
Wait, Master!

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
So, you're following that guy
into a fight with the assassin?

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
Is it really worth being
involved with someone

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
that dangerous?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
"That guy" is my
little brother, Krylancelo,

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
and he's a great Sorcerer
whom you ought to respect.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
Even if he's no longer
as great as he was.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
I'll trust in
your judgment, Master.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
Uh... Right!

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] And now I
unsheathe thee, Sword of Light!

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
Not much point in holding
back now, is there?

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
I scale thee,
Heavenly Snowy Mountain!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN shouts]

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Sorry to be rude,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
but I don't intend to let this
affair drag on too long.

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
He's here. Must have known
I would come in this way.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
That's right.
It's not that hard.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
I know how you think,
so I know where you'll go,

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
and I can always reach
you in an instant.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
You haven't
hurt Claiomh, right?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
She's safe, but she isn't going
to be leaving this place

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
with you, and neither
is that Deep Dragon.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
Well, you're
certainly confident.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
Yes. And I'm betting you've
figured out who I am by now,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
haven't you, Orphen?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
Or maybe, "Old Krylancelo"?

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Gotta keep dodging
till I find his weakness.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I unsheathe thee,
Sword of Light!

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.795 position:50% align:center
Guide my path,
Deathsong Starling!

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts] I crush thee,
Primordial Silence!

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That last shot
should've been enough

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
to blow most of the
roof off this place.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO] You put some
power into that attack.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
If it had hit cleanly,
you might have won.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
Damn. I didn't even
leave a mark.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
You might think about
aiming directly at me

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
instead of blasting away
chunks of the building.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
That is, if you
wanna win the fight.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
But wait, you're still
scared to take a life,

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.578 position:50% align:center
aren't you?

00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna beat me
unless you kill me.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
We'll see.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you this.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
I want you to hear
it before you die,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
'cause it's the only reason
I'd bother fighting you

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
to begin with.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
--Azalie.
--[gasps]

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] She's the one who's
been giving you orders,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
isn't she?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO] It's true she
wanted me to fight you.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
She still thinks
she needs you back,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
and facing me might force you
to overcome your weakness

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
and start acting like the
Sorcerer you could have been

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
if you never left the Tower.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
That may be, but I have my
own reason to fight you,

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
and it won't end how she wants.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna
give you the chance

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
to go back to your old self.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
If you did, you would only
end up hurting her again.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
Besides, she has
something better.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
Because, she has me!

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, KRYLANCELO grunting]

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
I call upon thee, Tiny Spirits!

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center

than this world needs!

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
I was trying to
stay out of reach

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
so that I wouldn't have to fight
an assassin head to head

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
on a level playing field.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
You failed!

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, KRYLANCELO grunting]

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
You...!

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:06.421 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
And that's what happens
when you get cocky

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
and drop your guard.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
You can use Sorcery
to close that wound,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
but you've still got no
way to put your blood

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
back in your body.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
True enough. I repair thee,
Scars of the Sunset.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Hmph!

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.483 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
It seems you came prepared.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
Did you really think I
was just gonna wing it?

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
But you don't wanna go
head-to-head, right?

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.324 position:50% align:center
Is this what you meant by that?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
I couldn't take you
in a fair fight,

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
so I've been coming up
with dirty tricks.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
I have three of them for you.
That was the first.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
Too bad it'll only work once.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.
Like I said, there's two more.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
Check this out.

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.052 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, KRYLANCELO grunting]

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
Let's see how you fight
with a concussion!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
Sleep tight, Krylancelo.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
Sorry to tell you, but you
won't put me to bed that easily.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
[CAPTAIN] The disturbance
was reported 30 minutes ago.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
Looks like the place
has gone quiet.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
Not sure if we should charge.

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Is there something
troubling you, Captain?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
You're here, too?

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
A pair of powerful Sorcerers
is battling in there.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
I'm asking you to
leave this to me.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
Then we'll trust you to
handle the situation.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
Time to break in.

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC grunts]

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I was right.
You've become a great man.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Azalie!

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
You've been keeping an
eye on me all along.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
White Sorcerers are able to use
mental projection techniques

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
to conduct long
distance surveillance.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
She's too attached,

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
and that makes you
a danger to her.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
You may not believe,

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
but as rusty as you've gotten,

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
you're still the Successor
of the Razor's Edge.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that you
recognize where you are.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
Are those runes?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
Ancient Sorcery.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
Childman was the greatest
scholar in the field,

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:26.436 position:50% align:center
and he left all his
knowledge to her.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
But I'm guessing you never
knew anything about that.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Nornir's Legacy.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly. And you may be
surprised to learn that their

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.322 position:50% align:center
legacy also includes the
knowledge of the Nornir's

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
most powerful weapons,
known as the Killing Dolls.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
I've heard of them before.

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
They're powerful
anti-Sorcerer weapons.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
Humanoid figures whose bodies
are engraved with Nornir runes.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
Completing the runes
brings the dolls to life,

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
and they use Silent Sorcery.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
She was keeping watch over
you for a long time,

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
exactly as you thought.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.347 position:50% align:center
And then she took
control of me, to test you.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
The Sword of Baldanders!

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO] She used the
Ancient Sorcery locked

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
in this sword to transform me
into her ideal assassin. You.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Thanks to that,

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
I have all of your Sorcery
techniques at my disposal,

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
or at least the ones you
had when she knew you.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
[grunts, gasps]

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm? Paralyzing Sorcery?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
I don't have any reason
to kill this girl,

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
even if you plan
on abandoning her

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
and running off on your own.

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
But it might still be fun to
cut her with this sword,

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Would she cry if she woke up
and suddenly found out that

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
she'd been turned into
a frog or a snake?

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
I was hoping that I
wouldn't have to do this,

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
but I guess it's time
for trick number three.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, KRYLANCELO grunting]

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
It looks like in the end,

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
you're gonna get what
you wanted, Childman!

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO groans, yells]

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.426 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO grunts]
That's his technique.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
Your third trick was
Childman's trump card.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but the elbow strike
was just the setup.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
I don't fight clean when
my life's on the line.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
Here's the real trick. I've got
no problem killing someone

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
to keep that tomboy safe.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
Even after you lost
all that blood,

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
you didn't slow down a bit.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
I knew something had to be up,

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
but I wouldn't have guessed
that you were a doll.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
Be careful.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] This is it. I can't be
the one who screws it all up!

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN exhales] You know
what a pain you can be?

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.759 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO]
Your last dirty trick was more

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
straightforward than I expected.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.762 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
But you failed.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.940 position:50% align:center
Now your only option is to
pit your strength against mine

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
and fight me on even terms.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
That's the way you
think this is gonna go?

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
I know it is, and I know
I'm gonna win, too.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50% align:center
I have to, for her.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
How many times am
I gonna hear that?

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
So is everything
you do for Azalie?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course.

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
She's my reason for being,
and what I live for!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
I was brought into this
world to be her weapon!

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
Now you've really got
me pissed off!

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.051 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of your crap. Let's go!

00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee,
Sword of Light!

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
I construct thee,
Spire... of the Sun!

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
This is nothing.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
Even the full force of the
Deep Dragons' Sorcery

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
is useless against the
body of a Killing Doll!

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
Ha! Guide my path,

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:12.328 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
I crush thee...
Primordial... Silence!

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
[KRYLANCELO grunts]

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
Even now, you're still able
to draw out this much power!

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I don't know whether
I'll be able to survive

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
being caught up in the blast
from our spells colliding!

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
I have to win this
fight no matter what,

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.772 position:50% align:center
for her sake!

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
I'll ram those words down
your throat, you bastard!

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
You don't know how many things
I've wanted to say to you

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.031 position:50% align:center
and never thought
I'd get the chance!

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
You say it's all for her sake?

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
I think you're just making
excuses for everything

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
that you left behind!

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
There were others
who needed you too,

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
but you abandoned them
without a second thought!

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
I've been... searching for you.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
You're still alive.
You can save her.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
And without them, you're no
good for anything but killing!

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
The Thirteen Apostles
only wanted you

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
for the assassination arts
that Master taught you!

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
It's for her sake.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
For her sake... I have to--

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
So you latched onto her and told
yourself that what you were

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
doing was right,

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:31.408 position:50% align:center
knowing damn well the only thing
you've ever done is run away!

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA, MAGIC grunt]

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
Sounds like the
fight just ended.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
But who won?

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
--[MAJIC gasps]
--[LETICIA] Majic!

Uh, coming!

[KRYLANCELO]
Azalie... belongs to me.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
I'm pathetic. Seriously.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
Get out of my head.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] I guess it
really doesn't work.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN exhales]

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Azalie! Tell me why
you murdered the elders!

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
Was it spite? Why did
the ranger have to die?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
And why would you drag
Claiomh into it?

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I never expected that
doll to start acting

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
outside of the orders
that I'd given it.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.143 position:50% align:center
I don't know how,

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
but it seems the thing
developed a will of its own.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
A will?

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.106 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
It hardly matters now.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
I have more important
things to do.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
O Chaos!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't do to
make a murderer

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
of my little brother, would it?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
That big sister act isn't
gonna be nearly enough

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
for me to forgive
what you've done.

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
Come on now,
don't make that face.

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
I only did it because
I was afraid.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Of what?

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.594 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
I was afraid that you would
be coming for my life.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
You're saying you're
scared of me?

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
You, the most powerful of all
Childman's students,

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:25.730 position:50% align:center
the Chaos Witch herself? Ha!
Then I guess you're in luck.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
I'm too weak to defend
myself from you right now.

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
No, Krylancelo.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
I will never be
able to kill you,

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:39.285 position:50% align:center
because you're the only true
Successor of the Razor's Edge.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
Do you remember when you
left for the royal capitol?

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
After you attacked the
elders' messenger in a rage,

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
that's when I realized,
my suspicions were correct.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
Suspicions? I was just mad
that he tried to stop me,

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
and he said something
that pissed me off.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
Azalie. That was nothing
more than an angry kid

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
lashing out at the world.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.810 position:50% align:center
Even Childman himself
would have told you

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
that it didn't mean
anything at all!

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
I want you to stop for
a minute and think about

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:11.443 position:50% align:center
all of the mental control
training he put you through.

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
Right here in this basement.
You, and you alone.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
We were all part of
the Childman Class,

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
but he never singled anyone else
out for mental control training.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
And why not?

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
It was because Master had a very
specific role in mind for you.

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Azalie!

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
His goal was to train you
into a powerful weapon,

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
built solely to neutralize
White Sorcerers.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
I was the only student who
could've ever surpassed him,

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
and you were his
insurance policy

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
in case I ever turned on him.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
You know it's true.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
When you learned mental control
techniques and trained in the

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
art of killing, he was forging
a dagger to drive into my back!

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
No, I don't believe it!

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I know Master would never
use his students like that!

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
And even if that was his plan,

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.071 position:50% align:center
I'm not cut out
to be an assassin.

00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:58.948 position:50% align:center
I always loved you.
Always looked up to you.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
You're the one who was always
there to show me the way

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
forward, and all I want--

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Azalie, I swear.
All I want is to give you

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
a place where you can live
in peace. Please believe me.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
But you can't.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Please, Sis...

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't that nostalgic?

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
When was the last time you
addressed me as your sister?

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
That's what you are.

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
And Tish was waiting
for you, too.

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
We can still be a family.
You're not in this alone!

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
It's too late. I can't
put my plan on hold.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
What plan?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
Master Childman was working
toward some grand scheme

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
and I'm going to
find out what it was.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
Please, stay by
my side, Krylancelo.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
You're the only assassin in
this world who could ever truly

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
threaten my life,

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
and I'm the only person
in this world who can

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
understand the hell you've
been through and lift you up

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
when you start to buckle
under that burden.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
But I can't.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that we'll
meet again soon.

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
You can give me your
answer when we do.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
But if you intend to make
a promise to a woman,

00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
then you'd better be able to
prove to her that your words

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
are worth hearing in the
first place. You understand?

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH whimpers]

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I should leave
before she wakes up

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.861 position:50% align:center
and you have to
explain all this.

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
I'd love to pay Tish a visit,

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:21.948 position:50% align:center
but for now, she needs
to think I'm dead.

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center
At least until I've arrived.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
I'm going to Kimluck.

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center

Wait!

Can you hear me? Master!

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
Who is the true... successor?

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.627 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Orphen leaves
me behind sometimes

00:23:39.711 --> 00:23:41.212 position:50% align:center
when he's going
somewhere dangerous,

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.131 position:50% align:center

out for me, right?

The real danger is you!
