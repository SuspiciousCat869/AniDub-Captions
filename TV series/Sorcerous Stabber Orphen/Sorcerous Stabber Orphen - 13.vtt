00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
I get it now!

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
Since Majic couldn't keep
his hands off of a book,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
some bad guys split my head
open and almost killed Tish.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.608 position:50% align:center
And now they wanna murder all
of us to get that Transcript

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
or whatever, so we have to
take them out first, right?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
You've actually managed
to sum it up pretty well.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm pretty smart
if I put my mind to it.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
For what? Sticky fingers?

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like I meant
to steal the Transcript!

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
But Claiomh's right, Tish was
really hurt because of me.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.881 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA grunts]

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:59.267 position:50% align:center
That wasn't your fault.
It was bound to happen.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
Uoar's too ambitious.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
His class would've
come for us anyway.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] So, we're supposed
to sneak into the Tower,

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.484 position:50% align:center
but how do we do that?

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.235 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
We'll just go over the wall.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.529 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH, MAJIC]
Huh?

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
Why does that surprise you?
Are you two forgetting who I am?

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna be climbing it.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
With a bit of Sorcery, we can
easily get past that wall.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.084 position:50% align:center
I scale thee,
Heavenly Snowy Mountain!

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.275 position:50% align:center
As long as you can
neutralize gravity,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
spatial transfer is a
pretty simple process.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.280 position:50% align:center
Follow me.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.494 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] Are you even sure that
the Uoar class is still here?

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Yeah. They shouldn't
have left just yet.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Why not?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.291 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If a bunch of
stabbers in full gear

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
went out, the guards
would definitely notice.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
They'd stand out too much.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.132 position:50% align:center
Also, Forte would realize
something was wrong

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.925 position:50% align:center
with his network.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50% align:center
If I were in their shoes,
I'd go with the easiest option.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
Wait in the Tower until
the dead of night,

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
and then leave when the
guards aren't quite as alert.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.353 position:50% align:center
The dead of night?
You mean like now?

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
That's right. But it is strange.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:29.733 position:50% align:center
They should've known that
I'd come to the Tower.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:33.611 position:50% align:center
There you go again!
Talking like you're all alone!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
What I meant was
they're expecting us,

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.115 position:50% align:center
and we should be careful.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
Couldn't we contact the
rest of the Childman Class?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
Get some back up?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
I would, if I could.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
Even if it's just us three,

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
it's still a good idea to
bring the fight to them!

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
Agreed.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
They're trained Stabbers,
but we can't wait just for them.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.088 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
There's a part of me
that wants to find out...

00:02:56.343 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
...if I'm strong enough to
take on the Uoar Class.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
If I'm worthy to be called the
"Successor of the Razor's Edge."

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
Now that we're inside,
what should we do next?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure. Got any ideas?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, I've got a good one!

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
Let's just have Leki
blow up the whole tower

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
and the bad guys with it!

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC, ORPHEN groan]

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I should've known
it'd be something dumb.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
So, no? But, why not?

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
That plan's way too reckless!

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
We're wasting our time sitting
here and discussing it.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
I say we go to the guardroom.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
We can explain to
them what's going on.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center
Afterwards,
we'll play it by ear.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] That sounds
pretty reckless, too.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.887 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
There's nobody here?

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
Did the Uoar Class already
start their attack?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] You're close.
We're beginning now!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
Yaslan's Coffin!

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:03:58.863 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Stay back!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee,
Sword of Light!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Orphen!

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
Swaine's here, too?

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Come, Demon Sword of Puanook!

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Leki, do something!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
I've been waiting for this.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Stand up, Krylancelo.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
It's not like I really
mind either way.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
But if you're gonna
cause a big scene,

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
the guards will probably
be called over.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
Do you think I care
about some guards?

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
Besides, if anyone comes,
it'll be Master Uoar's problem.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
It's just one of the perks of
being part of the upper echelon.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.761 position:50% align:center
Furthermore, it's a widely
known fact that the Uoar

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
and Childman Classes
are vying for power.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
To any witnesses,
I'd just be settling a fight.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
So you don't care if
Uoar gets found out?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
That's some loyalty
to your Master!

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] The only thing I care
about right now is killing you!

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN gasps]
--[HYDRANT shouts]

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
So you're the bastard
that ambushed Tish!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
I don't know what your
goal is with all of this,

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
but you hid the fact that the
Chaos Witch is still alive!

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee.
Come now, Sword of Light!

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Tamankama's Mirror! Go!

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I scale thee,
Heavenly Mountain!

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.139 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I call upon thee, Tiny Spirits!

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I brandish thee,
Blade of Demons!

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:03.363 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] So this is where
you've chosen to settle things.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
Back in the old training room.
I'm sure it's quite nostalgic.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Have you ever felt a
shred of remorse

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.748 position:50% align:center
for what you did to my face?

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
This damn scar. Every day
it reminds me of you.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
And all of the pain
and humiliation

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
that you made me suffer!

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
[MALE GUARD A]
So you're from Tafrem?

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
You're surprisingly young.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
I never would've
guessed you were

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
the Sorcerer the
Apostles summoned.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. I'm here
to accept the trial

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
to become one of
the court Sorcerers.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
If you do this,

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
you'll be going against
the elders' wishes.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm?

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
You're Milan Toram.
From the Uoar class.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I've heard that people
call you Hydrant, is that right?

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
And that you're currently
working for the upper echelon.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
What do you want with me?

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
I'm here on the elders'
orders to bring you back.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
From what I've heard,

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
even Childman was
against you coming here.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
And yet, you chose to
go behind their backs.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
You left the tower in hopes of
joining the Thirteen Apostles.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
Though I can't blame you.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
Becoming an Apostle is
truly an admirable goal.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
But of all the students
of the Tower,

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50% align:center
you're the only one who's
not allowed to leave.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] You know
what I'm talking about.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
There has to be a Sorcerer
who can kill her

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
at the tower at all times.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
Kill who?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Don't be naive.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
The Chaos Witch, Azalie.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
It is your sole responsibility
to kill her if necessary.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
All your training,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
everything you've learned has
been for that singular purpose.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.066 position:50% align:center
You're a sharpened blade
made to stab at her heart!

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:07.570 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
Stop it!

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] I couldn't care
less about whatever book

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
Uoar's trying to find.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
The only thing on my mind
right now is getting payback

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
for the scar you gave me.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] An eye for an eye, huh?
Well, what do you know,

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
I've been looking to
get even with you too.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50% align:center
I've never forgotten what
you said at the capital.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
And just like your scar, I've
been tormented every day since!

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
And that's not
everything you owe me.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
You still have to pay
for hurting Tish!

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
I strike at thee.
Spill forth, Glass Hail!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I unsheathe thee.
Come now, Sword of Light!

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT yells]
Counter!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
When it comes to Sorcery,
you're far from my equal!

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
It's time to finish this.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT] After you, we'll take
care of the rest of your class!

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
This is the end!

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
I dance within thee,
Heavenly Castle!

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Your sorcery may be strong,

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't matter now.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
It won't be any help
in a fist fight.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
[gasps, grunts]

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Orphen? Majic?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.832 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
Shine.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
What a mess.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
All he had to do was follow
the plan. Damn you, Hydrant.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
What do to with you?

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
What's going on? Uh?

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.639 position:50% align:center
My name's Vinbi Stotall.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
At least, that's what
I'm called now.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
You better not come any
closer or I'll scream!

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
Shut up!

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
There should be three of them.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center
[VINBI] Hydrant is dealing
with Krylancelo.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
But where did the boy
run off to? Damn it.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
I guess I drew the short straw,

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
having to deal with
a worthless girl.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
I'm not worthless!

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH grunts]
Let me go!

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
[VINBI gasps]
You can read my mind?

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
Dissolve!

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Help me, Leki!

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
[VINBI yells]

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
[VINBI]
Repair!

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
[grunts] So you had a
Deep Dragon with you.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
That's fine. I'll simply
have to kill you both!

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC grunts]
Huh?

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm? Uh.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
I call on thee, Tiny Spirits!

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
How did I get over here?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right. I was about
to get hit by that attack.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
Then Leki saved me.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
What was it? Master called it
"Spatial something."

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
Spatial Displace?
No, that's not it.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
Transfer.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah! That's it! Huh?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
It looks like the Deep Dragon

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
accidentally transferred
me as well.

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
it was probably trying to
send your Master with you.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
Huh? This is all
your fault, Leki!

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
You can blame that
Dragon all you want,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
but the truth is,
you shouldn't have come.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
I'll let Milan settle his
score with Krylancelo.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.707 position:50% align:center
Swords!

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I knit thee thus,
Chainmail of Haloes!

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
Strike true!

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC gasps]

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.638 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.057 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] I won't stop you
if you want to run away.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
But this stays with me.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] I'm quite
surprised you're the one

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
carrying this instead
of Krylancelo.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
The Transcript!

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
I promised Master that
I'd keep it safe!

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] You should have
done the smart thing

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
and kept running.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're gonna be
able to get the Transcript back.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
Unless you really think
you can beat me.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
Master told me to protect it.
I won't give up!

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
I always feel like
I'm in his way

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
or that I'm holding
him back, but no more!

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
I unsheathe thee.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
Come, Sword of Light!

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:50.478 position:50% align:center
[grunts]
That's hot!

00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
My hand!

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
It's okay?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
I finally controlled it!

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] That was a nice try,
but you missed me!

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
O Swords!

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
I've wasted too much time here,

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
and Master Uoar's waiting
for the Transcript.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
It's really too bad.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
That boy's sorcery
was quite impressive.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
Then again, no matter how
talented a Sorcerer is,

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.805 position:50% align:center
it's meaningless
if they're dead.

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Don't count me out just yet!

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
What?

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
How did he use Spatial Transfer?

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I didn't think
it would actually work.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] That's supposed to be
Childman's signature move.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
How could a brat like you do it?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
Of course. Krylancelo learned
it from Childman and then

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
he taught it to you!
That must be it!

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't exactly
call it "teaching".

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
But he showed it to--

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC grunts]

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.668 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE] A novice like you can't
sustain all of those techniques.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
You pulled it off once, but you
won't dodge my attack again.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE]
O Swords!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Hark, O Light!

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
[SWAINE grunts]

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
O Wind!

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:19.567 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Don't worry about him.

00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
Relax, Krylancelo will
take care of the rest.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
This is an issue for
Sorcerers to fix.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, but I'm actually
also a Sorcerer.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
I applied to study under
the tower just yesterday.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
And I approved your admission.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
Once this is over,
you'll become my student.

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Huh?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Focus on the
direction of their movements.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
Feel their energy.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
And counter their attack!

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.723 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
This is Sunda.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
It's one of Childman's
special combat techniques.

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Demon Sword of Puanoo--

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Take this!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.234 position:50% align:center
There's no way you can beat
me in close-quarter combat.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
Childman personally
trained me in countless

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:04.654 position:50% align:center
fighting techniques.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
[HYDRANT]
Tsk. Of course he did.

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:10.285 position:50% align:center
So you could kill... her.

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
The Chaos Witch!

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I thought you'd have
learned your lesson last time.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
But some people never learn.

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:24.674 position:50% align:center
Let's see if it sticks after
I burn off the other half.

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Don't! Please no!
Please have mercy!

00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Have you ever shown
mercy to anyone?

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
The Dragon Faith Worshipers?
Or what about Tish's fingers?

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH grunts]
Mm? Orphen?

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
Where were you?

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
Leki saved me!

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
After that attack I was afraid
you died or something!

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're okay.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
I ran into some guy named
Vinbi who attacked me,

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:05.215 position:50% align:center
but when Leki stopped him,
he tried to kill him too!

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
So, you had a Deep Dragon
with you. That's fine.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
Then I'll just have
to kill you both!

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
[VINBI laughs]

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
The next thing I knew, Leki had
transferred us both over here!

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN] Uh...
--By the way, is that guy dead?

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph. Nah.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
I have to say, I'm glad that
I brought you along, Claiomh.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Huh?

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Let's go.
We're putting an end to this.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center
[UOAR]
You've kept us waiting.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I'm late,

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.138 position:50% align:center
I was a little busy
taking out some trash.

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
But there's more in here.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
You surprise me, Krylancelo.

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
I never would have expected
you to bring your friends

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
along with you.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:04.441 position:50% align:center
I was under the impression
that you always acted alone.

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
But it doesn't matter,
now that I have

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
the Browning Family World
Transcript in my possession.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
We accomplished our mission
when Swaine took it

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
from your student
and brought it back.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
There are a whole bunch of
things that piss me off.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
Like having to chase down a
couple of weasels that can't

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
pay back what they owe me.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
Or worse than that,
dealing with spoiled brats.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
Hell, it seems like every
other person I meet

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
is just trying to make me angry.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
But after watching you scheme

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
and try to worm your
way up the ladder.

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
I can't even get mad.
You're just pathetic.

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
You finally have it,
the "Transcript".

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
How many did you kill to get it?
How much blood is on your hands?

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
There's no price too
great for the Transcript.

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
It is precisely because of this
book that Childman was able

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
to acquire such power.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
It holds the secrets to an
incredibly strong Sorcery

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
within the depths
of its ancient text.

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Holds "secrets", huh?
Well, you're not wrong,

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
but those "secrets"
aren't worth much.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
Her diary just happened
to be the same size

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
as your Transcript.

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
With a couple of changes
here and there,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
It's hard to tell them apart.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
Damn you! Argh!

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
Kill them!

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
O Spear!

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph...! Forte!

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.791 position:50% align:center
Everyone, stand down.

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
You're all under arrest for
attacking Leticia MacCredy,

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
a high-ranking Sorcerer
from the Childman Class.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Additionally, you've been
accused of murdering

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
Dragon Faith worshipers.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.929 position:50% align:center
Therefore, I've been ordered
by the upper echelon

00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.180 position:50% align:center
to bring you in.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
I find that difficult
to believe.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
Here's the arrest warrant.
Read it.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
It was signed by Milan Toram.

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
He is still part of the
upper echelon.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
I gave him a choice.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
He could either sign
it and be spared,

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
or go down with the Uoar Class.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:18.908 position:50% align:center
He didn't hesitate.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
And now it's your turn.

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
What choice will you make,
Uoar Curlaine?

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
Will you call off your
men and surrender?

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
Or will you choose destruction?

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
I'm not as kind
as Krylancelo is.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
Nor do I have his
combat experience.

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
So I won't be holding back.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
[UOAR] Do you really think
you can take all of us on

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
at the same time?

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center
You've become quite arrogant,
Forte Puckingham.

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
What if I even the odds?

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
You're here?

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
Why did you show yourself?

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.862 position:50% align:center
This is too dangerous for
you to handle on your own.

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
But Forte's here!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
He's not surprised?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Of course. His network.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
You made one mistake.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
If your goal is to destroy
the Childman Class,

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
you have to pay attention to
more than just Krylancelo.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
[growls]
Damn you, Chaos Witch!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
[UOAR yells]

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.021 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] There was only one
assassination technique

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
that I inherited from Master.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:41.533 position:50% align:center
It's a move designed to
instantly kill your opponent!

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN pants]

00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
That's enough, Krylancelo.
I'll finish it from here.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
There's just one more thing
to do before we turn them in.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:06.850 position:50% align:center
I need to erase any
memories of me.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSINS gasp]

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
Chaos Witch Sorcery!

00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
[ASSASSINS grunt]

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE]
To oblivion! Begone!

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.583 position:50% align:center
[FORTE]
Take them away.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:39.591 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I see. You and Azalie
were using me the whole time.

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
[FORTE] I'm sorry.
I didn't have any other choice.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
This was the only way to
take down the Uoar Class.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
With Uoar out of the way,

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:52.062 position:50% align:center
I guess you'll be taking
control of the Tower.

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.980 position:50% align:center
Like Master did.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
that Master's dead.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.195 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hmph.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
I went over to Tish's mansion
and grabbed the real Transcript.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.162 position:50% align:center
Huh! Wait, how exactly did
Uoar find out about that book?

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.083 position:50% align:center
It was the perfect opportunity
to get the Uoar class

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.459 position:50% align:center
to slip up.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
Though it's too bad that
there isn't actually

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.046 position:50% align:center
any Sorcery in the book.

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:20.674 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]
What do you mean?

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:25.345 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]
Azalie!

00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:28.515 position:50% align:center
You still haven't answered
any of my questions!

00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:31.434 position:50% align:center
"The answer to all questions
can be found here."

00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:34.354 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Do you want to
know what's written in the

00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.606 position:50% align:center
Browning Family
World Transcript?

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.192 position:50% align:center
It's a record of how
the world will change.

00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:40.527 position:50% align:center
No one's noticed it yet,

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.780 position:50% align:center
but the world's headed
towards destruction.

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:45.198 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.867 position:50% align:center
If you want me to answer
any more of your questions,

00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center
find me in Kimluck.

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:55.417 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN sighs]

00:22:56.459 --> 00:22:58.378 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Azalie had disappeared.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:02.882 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] She left Tafrem
in search of answers.

00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:06.344 position:50% align:center
Was she trying to
help her old friends?

00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:09.848 position:50% align:center
Was her search related
to her dead Master?

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:14.602 position:50% align:center
Or perhaps, it had something to
do with the end of the world?

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:18.815 position:50% align:center
To uncover the truth,
Orphen's journey continues!

00:23:22.402 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Kimluck.

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] This all started
when I activated

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.087 position:50% align:center
the Sword of Baldanders.

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.590 position:50% align:center
What exactly was Master
trying to accomplish?

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:45.467 position:50% align:center
I'm going to find out!

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Sis.
