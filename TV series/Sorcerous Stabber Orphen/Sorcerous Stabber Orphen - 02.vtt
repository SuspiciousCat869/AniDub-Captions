As he spoke,

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
the monster raised its
head and let out a roar.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.877 position:50% align:center
To human ears, it was
the cry of a beast,

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.214 position:50% align:center
bearing no more meaning
than the baying of a dog.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.051 position:50% align:center
And yet, as the creature's
voice rang out across the sky,

the air trembling
under its weight...

Where's Corgon?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Last I saw, he was in the
attic with his nose in a book.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
Meaning he hasn't left?

[LETICIA]
Color me surprised.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
We need to do something
about that habit of his.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
As class monitor I'm supposed
to know where he is,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center

help if he would tell me.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.131 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN] And the reason
you started on this journey

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
was to track her down and change
her back to normal, wasn't it?

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I was about to
give up looking for her,

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center
until she suddenly
appeared in front of me.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
But, I don't know what
kind of Sorcery she used

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
when she transformed herself,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
which means I can't do
anything to reverse it.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.901 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
Krylancelo.

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Sorry. It's "Orphen" now, right?

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Heartia!

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Let's go.
Master's waiting to see you.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you
were in Totokanta, too.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
I'm the local branch secretary.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
To be honest though, I'm more
like a glorified housekeeper.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed, Heartia.
Not one bit.

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA] Heh. But you've
changed quite a bit.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Uh.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] Five years have
come and gone, Krylancelo.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
As you see, Master has
finally recovered.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Who is this a
funeral for, anyway?

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:49.292 position:50% align:center
It's for Azalie.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Then did she
escape from her coffin?

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
[MALE STUDENT D gasps]

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
This funeral is a sham and
everybody here knows it!

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
[LETICIA] Please, Krylancelo.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You want to protect the
Tower by hiding everything

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
that's happened,

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.475 position:50% align:center
and that'll be easier if
we all pretend she's dead.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
We have no choice. She turned
herself into a monster

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
in her recklessness
and then escaped.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
That stain on our honor could
destroy the Tower of Fangs.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
How can you call Azalie a stain?

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
She's one of the
greatest talents

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
to ever come out of this place.
A master of Black Sorcery

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
who also learned White
Sorcery on her own!

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
Yes. We've lost a truly
impressive Sorcerer.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
She's not lost!
You know that she's still alive!

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
[HEARTIA]
Cut it out!

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.627 position:50% align:center
All you're doing is making
things worse for yourself!

00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
I'm only speaking the truth!

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.756 position:50% align:center
You're a member of the
Tower's elite now,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
the top Sorcerer in our class!

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
None of that matters!
It should have been her.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
Azalie has far more
talent than I do,

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
but she thought the exams
were a waste of time.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
And we'd be wasting our time
by burying an empty coffin,

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
so now I'm going to give you
all a reason to be here.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
Krylancelo is dead!

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
That name will be buried
here today, in this grave,

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.573 position:50% align:center
with the memory of Azalie.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
I'm going to find her,
no matter what.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
Even if it takes my whole life.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
In the end, I can be replaced,
but she can't!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
From now on, call me
what I am, an orphan!

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
There's something that I meant
to ask you when you woke up.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
She said the two of you
were planning

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.596 position:50% align:center
some kind of experiment.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.349 position:50% align:center
What exactly was
she talking about?

00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
Attempting to activate
the Sword of Baldanders.

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
The Sword of Baldanders.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
That experiment was a failure.
The sword's magic discharged,

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
leaving Azalie in her
transformed state.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
And me in a deep coma.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
I am awake now, and she
has reemerged as well.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
My guess, is that she has
also been unconscious

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.083 position:50% align:center
since she transformed.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
But we have no way of knowing
if she still remembers

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
the person she was
up to that day.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
It's possible that she retained
her memories and impulses.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
Including an instinctual
urge to try and return

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
to her human form.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
How did that sword
end up here?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
That was on Master's orders.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
Just as he was losing
consciousness,

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
he asked Forte to deliver it.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] I've been close
with the Everlasting family

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
for some time.

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
To keep the sword from falling
into the wrong hands,

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
I had it sent to them and
sealed in their armory.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
And that must be what drew
Azalie to their estate.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
She wanted that sword, to try
and reverse her transformation.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
We followed her here
based on that same notion.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
But so far, we've failed
to capture her.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If you're both
fresh out of a coma, 

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
you should still be more
powerful than her.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
Even the Tower's
greatest prodigy

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
couldn't rival your ability.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
My Black Sorcery is stronger.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
But the matter is hardly
as simple as that.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.524 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Her White Sorcery.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN] Indeed, the power
to manipulate the flow of time

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
and the human mind.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
Subtle, and yet
devastatingly powerful.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.163 position:50% align:center
Our counter strategy
is to attack

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
with an overwhelming
number of Sorcerers.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Black Sorcerers would
be preferable,

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
ones who've proven
themselves in combat.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.965 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] You're talking
about a plan to take down

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
one of your own students.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
Did you bring me here
so you could order me

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
to help you kill her?

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
I can't do that. I have no
authority over you now.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
I can only ask for your help.

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
I refuse!

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
She's not the Azalie we knew.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.316 position:50% align:center
She lost her mind and now she's
stolen a powerful artifact.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
If this gets out, the Tower of
Fangs will lose all authority.

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
Help us, Krylancelo. This is
your chance to redeem your name.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
You won't have to
bear the dishonor

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
of abandoning the Tower.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
And then you'll finally
be able to come home again.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
Heartia!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
That's enough.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
This argument won't
resolve anything.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
We're attacking tonight.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
I'm gathering a team of
Sorcerers to head out

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
and subjugate the monster.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
How do you know that you'll
be able to find her?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
I saw to it that we would
have a way to track her

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
as soon as we
reached Totokanta.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
I broke into the Everlasting
estate and set a beacon

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
on the Sword of Baldanders.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
It will lead us directly to her,
no matter where she runs.

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Then whatever I do,

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
you'll still be one
step ahead of me.

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
If you choose not to take part
in this subjugation mission,

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
you'll be giving up your only
chance to see her alive again.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
The choice is yours, Krylancelo.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
When will you be heading out?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
The mission begins at sundown.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
Use this time to prepare.

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
Your lunch is ready if
you want it, Orphen.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
Uh! Are you walking
out on your tab?

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.518 position:50% align:center
--No, of course not.
--Okay.

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, it's just
part of my work.

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
Ah. I guess it must be
pretty hard being a loan shark.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
The truth is, there's a chance
I won't make it back here.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:11.906 position:50% align:center
Time's been stuck for me
the last five years.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
And now it's moving again.
Someday, you'll understand.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
Probably.

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] My mother and sister
are still in bed right now,

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
so no marriage fraud today.

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
That was a one-time thing!

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. Did you come back
to clean up the mess?

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
I repair thee.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
Scars of the Sunset!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
Whoa! So, what do those
magic words mean?

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
Well, not a lot.

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
The most important part is using
my voice as a medium

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
to channel the power
of my Sorcery.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
It doesn't really matter
what words I use.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
Wow, seriously?

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I'll show you. "Repair."

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
 I'm surprised. You actually did
come back to fix everything.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
It's nice of you to say thanks,

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
but if you paid me I'd be able
to close my tab at the inn.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I would if I could,

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
but I don't have any money
that I can give you.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.186 position:50% align:center
How about this!

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Come on, I was just
kidding with you.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
This ring is another weird,
random thing

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.401 position:50% align:center
that one of the
Sorcerers brought here.

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.820 position:50% align:center
And my father told me
that I could keep it.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Do you know how to read
the characters on this ring?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
I couldn't even tell
they were characters.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
They're wyrd glyphs.
Ancient writing. It's a spell.

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
"Be disarmed, my foes,"
is how it's read.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
It seems like this ring was
meant to protect the person

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
wearing it from an attack.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
But I think the enchantment
can only work once.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN] Oh, yeah?
--That's right.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
The engraving's not too good,
so I don't think that the person

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
who made it was all that
powerful of a sorcerer.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
And I wish it was a bit bigger.
It barely fits on my pinky.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
I guess it was made for some
girly girl with pretty hands.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
I'm not dainty
enough to wear it.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
But you are a girly girl
with pretty hands, Azalie.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
 Aww, you're so sweet.
Thank you, Krylancelo.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
Hey. If they made
the ring that small,

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
I wonder if its original owner
might have been a little kid.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
That makes sense, yeah!
And if it was made for a child,

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
maybe we can trigger the spell
without an incantation!

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
Oh, and on that note,

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
we're trying an experiment
tonight with another enchanted 

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
item like this one.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
[AZALIE] Cool, huh?
I'm helping Master with it.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
He needs me to translate
the Wyrd Glyphs.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
I am a little nervous since he
said it could be dangerous.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
But we're going through with it.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Is there something
special about that thing?

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
Did Forte bring this here, too?

00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
Who's Forte?

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] A really tall
guy with shaggy hair.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, right!

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
He was the one who came
from the Tower of Fangs

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
to see my dad before!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
I thought it might
have been him.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.129 position:50% align:center
Did the two of you train
at the Tower together?

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:17.509 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Along with Azalie,
the one who owned this ring.

00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
Azalie?

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] When the monster
attacked yesterday,

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:26.935 position:50% align:center
I remember you trying to talk
to it and calling it "Azalie."

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
So was that thing somebody
you knew from the Tower?

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
Azalie's not a monster.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
Or a thing.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.743 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] Sorry I can't stay and
fix your yard. I'm in a hurry.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
I have to find Azalie.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
Will you capture her?

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
I won't. I'm gonna get
to her before they do,

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
convince her to go
with me, then run.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.548 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.758 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
I'm going to protect her.

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
[CHILDMAN]
It's time. Prepare to move out.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
So you came in the end.

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
The squad will be
marching shortly.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
We're going to need you to
take point for this fight.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
After all, we won't have to
write a letter of apology

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
if you die. Let's go.

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
You came, Krylancelo.

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
Hello, Comicron.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
These are experienced Sorcerers.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
Some of whom I know well.

00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
But I can't let that get to me.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
I'm going to protect her,
no matter what.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.461 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Orphen, I'm gonna
help you look for her!

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] It's too dangerous.
This has nothing to do with you!

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] But I know
how to use a sword!

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
And you do not wanna
see me when I'm angry!
