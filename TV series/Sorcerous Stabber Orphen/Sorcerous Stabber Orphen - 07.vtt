[SALUA gasps]

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.236 position:50% align:center
My head. I think that
something hit me from behind.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
No point in worrying
about that right now.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
What?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.825 position:50% align:center
And Fiena healed your wounds,
so you'll be fine.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center

What are you doing here?

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I know you want to
invade the heart of the forest,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
and I can't allow
that to happen.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
Salua! What is it that you want?

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
You need to release Fiena.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
Or what?

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.198 position:50% align:center
I wanna make a deal.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
Let her go and I'll give you

--who came here to kill you.

One of their Death Instructors.

You'd sell me out
like that, you snake?

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
Of course,
there's no way I'd work

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center

Now let Fiena go.

I refuse.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Can reaching the
heart of the forest

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
really be worth
all of this?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I have to gain more power.
More than even the Dragons.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
I can't let you stand in my way!

I saw something truly horrible.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
At Kimluck. Something that could
be the doom of all Kiesalhima.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
Tell me what it was you saw!

[SALUA] It looks like you must
have overheated the cylinder

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
when you hit the gun
with that attack.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
And when he pulled the trigger,

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
the whole thing blew
apart in his hand.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
So my job's done. Nice of
you to save me the trouble.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll be
taking off, then.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I always appreciate
a well-timed betrayal.

[RANGER C] Yes, ma'am,
I completely understand

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center

But we're in Kimluck Church

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
[RANGER B] Sorry, but our hands
are pretty much tied on this.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
We should wait back
at the station for orders

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
from the royal family.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
I don't have time for orders
or jurisdiction or whatever.

Don't! The Sanctuary's
way too dangerous!

You're gonna get killed!

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center

Grab on!

Let go and you die.

What the...? He's gone!

--[VILLAGER L] Any luck?
--[VILLAGER M] Nothing.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
--[VILLAGER N] Check the east!
--[VILLAGER O] We did.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.039 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER P]
Damn it, where are they?

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
Hey there. Let's get going.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Salua?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
[SALUA] The Sorcerer asked me to
get you kids out of this forest

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
if things in the
village got too crazy.

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Where's the brat?

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
[FIENA]
Majic went after Orphen.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
That's on him. Now let's go.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
You were crying about
being left here all alone.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
Do you not wanna leave anymore?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
This village shall be punished.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.487 position:50% align:center
You must go without delay.

00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
No, I can't leave this place.

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Because, my heart is telling
me that I have to stay.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN, MAJIC grunt]

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
Great, it worked!
We're safe now, right, master?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER A]
Over there! I see them!

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.295 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
Like I told you, ten meters
was all we could hope for!

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Am I really gonna
have to go all out here?

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN grunts]

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
I know that Sorcery.

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
It was the Deep Dragon!

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS gasping]

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER Q]
O Dragon.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER R]
O Master.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
Down here, Orphen!

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.204 position:50% align:center
Where'd you come from?

00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
It's a warzone here!

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Hm? What's that?

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
Oh, this guy? Apparently,
it's a baby Deep Dragon.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
For conspiring to trespass

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
on the Dragons' sanctuary,
you shall be destroyed.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
--[ORPHEN, MAJIC] Huh?
--[CLAIOMH yelps]

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
Are their lives worth
nothing to you?

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER C]
Help us, we beg of you!

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGER R]
Forgive our transgressions!

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
Ah! There's no other choice!

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
I dance within thee,
Heavenly Castle!

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.093 position:50% align:center
Even that had no effect!

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
What do we do now?

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
The Deep Dragon is able
to read our thoughts,

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
and our plans, too.
We're in trouble.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH gasps]

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Leave this village now!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
If you stop attacking, we'll let
this little one go free.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] Your bravado
will do you no good, Sorcerer.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Your child
is here in my hand.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
Do you still think I'm bluffing?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
You may do as you will.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] It matters naught.
Our Sorcery can revive the dead.

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
The village shall be
destroyed regardless.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
You can't!

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
The people of this village
worship you as their god!

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
I am well aware.

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
For my familiar has lived among
them as a Shrine Maiden.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
Fiena.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] As the
guardians of the sanctuary,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
we needed to keep a close watch
on the one named MacDougal.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.909 position:50% align:center
He sought to encroach
on our sacred ground,

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
an unforgivable transgression.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
To that end, I revived
a young girl who died

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
in the forest and sent her
to serve as my eyes and ears.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:58.380 position:50% align:center
MacDougal's plan failed,
he's dead now!

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] And yet the
villagers have elected

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
to persist in carrying on with
his sacrilegious endeavor.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
They debase themselves.
Worthless creatures.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
Worthless? What right
does a killer like you

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
have to decide what
a life is worth?

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.397 position:50% align:center
I'm your opponent right now.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
If you wanna hurt any
more of these people,

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
you're gonna have
to kill me first!

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.201 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] That feeble
little machine of yours

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
cannot harm me.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
[shouts]

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
Orphen!

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] I knit thee thus.
Chainmail of Haloes!

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.430 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:49.848 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] That's it!
You Dragons aren't gods.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
You're just Sorcerers
in a different form.

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
Back up. What's going on here?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
Human Sorcerers use
sound as a medium

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
to channel and
direct our power.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
But Deep Dragons use
their Dark Sorcery by

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
directing it through whatever's
in their field of vision.

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
Our power's reach is limited.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.792 position:50% align:center
It can only go as far
as our voices carry.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center
But it's the same
for the Deep Dragon.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
It can only use Sorcery
on what it can see.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
Which means we can
still beat it!

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
--Do that thing again, Majic.
--What thing?

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
That "Watching
Claiomh bathe" thing!

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC hums]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
--Oh, man, I love keeping watch.
--[MAJIC] Huh?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did you say
"watching Claiomh bathe"?

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Do it now!

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Uh.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
I disturb thee!
Go, Cage of Light!

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.411 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Huh?

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
You dare to interfere
with my vision?

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] When we refract
the light around you

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center
and alter what you see,

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
you can't use your
Sorcery against us.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] Such a low-level
trick will not be enough

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:06.341 position:50% align:center
to let you
claim victory, usurper.

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
I'm not done yet!

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
I construct thee.
Spire of the Sun!

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC groans]
Whoa. It worked!

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
I cooked off the gun.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
First, those three
rounds I fired before

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
made the cylinder heat up.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
Then I threw it into the air.

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Hitting it with the flame caused
the other barrels to fire.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
The fact they actually hit
the target was a lucky break.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Indeed, but it seems your luck

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
was still not
sufficient to kill me.

00:16:56.891 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
And even with what little
of my power yet remains,

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
I could certainly destroy you.

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:07.027 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Krylancelo.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:09.988 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Yes, I know who you are.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
We have an acquaintance
in common.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
Give them your thanks.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
For the sake of the pact we
made, I shall flee this place.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.085 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] A human making
a pact with a Dragon?

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
That could only be him...

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
You may live,

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
but the fate of this
village is sealed.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
I won't let you!

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
My name is Krylancelo.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
There's no living
thing I can't kill.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
Childman told me so himself!

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
Leave, or this place
will be your grave!

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.284 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] I told you
before to leave this village.

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
Why did you come back?

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:04.459 position:50% align:center
I'm here because I have
been called to be!

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
As your familiar, I can
share all of your senses,

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
and with those, I'm able to
use Sorcery equal to yours.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
I can't overcome your power,
but I can nullify it.

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
You know that your body and mind

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
would be annihilated
if you did that.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:22.143 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] I have been nothing
to these people. It's true.

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
I'm a shrine maiden
in name only.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.566 position:50% align:center
But even so, I cannot
allow them to die!

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
I'll protect them
if it kills me!

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
It would seem that I erred

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
in taking you for my familiar.
You are of no use to me anymore!

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN gasps]

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Fiena!

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Fools.

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
You fail to grasp
the significance

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
of invading the sanctuary.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to say
these people's ignorance

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
gives you the right
to slaughter them?

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
Indeed.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH]
You gotta be kidding? The nerve!

00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
You were willing to let
your own child get killed.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
Where do you get off
lecturing anybody?

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
All right, get him!

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.149 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON gasps]

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.155 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON yells]

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON]
And thus it must be.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
When we are commanded,

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
we are powerless to do
anything but obey.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Just as that child has
obeyed your command.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
[DEEP DRAGON] You will
surely come to recognize

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
your folly in time.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
You have gained a
freedom far beyond

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
what you can manage,

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
and in that freedom lies the
danger you pose to this world.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN grunts]

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Upsy-daisy.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
[DORTIN]
Guess we're not dead, huh?

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN grunts]
That damn loan shark.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
I guess he got burned to a
crisp by the Deep Dragon.

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
How unfortunate.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should offer a few words
for our dearly departed fri--

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
Really. You got anything
particular in mind?

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
[VOLKAN whimpers]

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:29.521 position:50% align:center
[FIENA] Let us go. A new
world is waiting for us.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fiena.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
Majic!

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I won't forget what
you've done. Thank you.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
Because of you and your master,
I'm no longer a familiar.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
I-I didn't really...

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
That means... My life's
become my own again!

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:57.007 position:50% align:center
Someday, I'm sure you'll
be a great Sorcerer.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
Uh... Thank you!

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
[FIENA chukles]

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
Hm!

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
That sucked.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
We lost so much time
in that village.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot,
you snot-nosed little punk.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC]
I hope Fiena will be okay.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN] If you're that worried
about her, then go with her!

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
[MAJIC] I can't do that! I have
to stick to the goal I set.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.868 position:50% align:center
I'll stay with you and
become a real Sorcerer!

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
Hey, if the Deep Dragon
could read our thoughts,

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
then why didn't it
realize your plan

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
and put a stop to it back there?

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
You mean having you use that
light refraction trick?

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
--Do that thing again, Majic.
--What thing?

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
That "Watching
Claiomh bathe" thing!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
I was able to hide my thoughts.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
Just for a second or two.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
It's a technique used to defend
against White Sorcery.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
Seriously, we're bringing
a baby Dragon with us?

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.397 position:50% align:center
Well I couldn't just leave him
out there alone, could I?

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Right, Leki?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:22:01.446 position:50% align:center
You even gave the thing a name.
Ah... Gimme a break, kid.

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
How'd I end up with
another mouth to feed?

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.878 position:50% align:center
[CLAIOMH] Hey, I wanna
know about Tafrem!

00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:43.256 position:50% align:center
Is it big or is it little?
Is it safe or is it dangerous?

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.841 position:50% align:center
Is it fun, or is it boring?

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.634 position:50% align:center
[ORPHEN]
Just wait till we get there.
