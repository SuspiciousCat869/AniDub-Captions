[ELAINA]
When I was a little girl,

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
I spent all of my time
nose deep in a book.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
My favorite was a
collection of stories

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
about a witch named Niké.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
She would detail her
journeys to faraway lands,

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.532 position:50% align:center
and I was obsessed
with her books.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.247 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
One day, I'm gonna
travel to new places,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.584 position:50% align:center
just like Niké!

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.836 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
Niké is a witch;

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.673 position:50% align:center
that means you'd have to study
magic and become one, too.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
So I can travel, too,
if I become a witch?

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. Right?

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER]
Hm?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
Sure. But only after you're
a witch <i>and</i> a little older.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
Okay, sweetie?

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
And once I do that,
do you promise

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
you'll let me go
travel the world?

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.399 position:50% align:center
Yes, I promise, so study hard.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
I'll do it. I'll become a witch!

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.745 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA giggles]

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:20.747 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Not to sound full of myself,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.291 position:50% align:center
but I was a very
dedicated student.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.418 position:50% align:center
I studied constantly.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.922 position:50% align:center
Rain, shine, day, and night.

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Then one day...

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.973 position:50% align:center
At the age of 14,
an extraordinary girl

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
passed the magic exams in
the peaceful country of Robetta.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50% align:center
She became the youngest
Apprentice Witch in history.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.943 position:50% align:center
That's right, it was me.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on
passing exams.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
We're so proud.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
And to think you're the
youngest one in history!

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.420 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
You're not happy?

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.505 position:50% align:center
The other examinees
were all fairly weak,

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.091 position:50% align:center
so of course I passed.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.592 position:50% align:center
But, on the bright side,
it looks like

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:18.096 position:50% align:center
I'll become an officially
certified witch in no time!

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.014 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.434 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
In order for an apprentice

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
to become a full witch, she must
first study under another witch

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
for a period of time until
they acknowledge her abilities.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
[WITCH 01A]
Coming!

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.758 position:50% align:center
Um... Hi!

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.675 position:50% align:center
You see...

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
I'm Elaina, and I...

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.262 position:50% align:center
...just passed the exams.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.224 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
[WITCH 01B]
Coming!

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I know you.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
I just passed the magic exams
and I was wondering--

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Unfortunately...

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
...since I was the youngest to
pass the exams in this country,

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
I'd earned a bit of a reputation
with the other witches.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:24.704 position:50% align:center
I'm way too busy. So sorry!

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
No matter who I sought out,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.043 position:50% align:center
they all refused to take
me on as an apprentice.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to become a witch now?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
It's just not fair.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.180 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER]
I heard a suspicious witch

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
has just moved into the woods.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Hm?

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, I heard
about that, as well.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
I believe she's called
the Stardust Witch.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER]
Oh.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I decided that
I would go and meet

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
with the Stardust Witch
and see what she was like.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
Since she wasn't
from our country,

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
my hope was that she
wouldn't know who I was

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
and would be more
willing to train me

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
as her apprentice.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
Could that be her?

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
[FRAN laughing]

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Oh, hi!

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
She's the Stardust Witch?

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:28.143 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Wow! Good babies!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll go home.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
[FRAN laughing]
Yes! You're doing great!

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
Yes, you are! Lovely!

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.656 position:50% align:center
--[sighs]
--[FRAN] There!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
Come, my dears!

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Fun!

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
Um, excuse me.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Yes? Oh, hello there!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Hi.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
You're Elaina.
Aren't you, darling?

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait,
you've heard of me?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
Yes. You're the girl

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
who passed the magic exams
on her first try at 14.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
You're quite famous.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
For better or worse.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Did you need something?

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
No. Sorry to bother you.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
Are you leaving already?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
looking for a teacher.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong about that?

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll just say no.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
Are you now?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Wait. What?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
I've got time to spare.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
Really? You're sure?

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.206 position:50% align:center
Even though...

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
I'm not as fragile as the
witches in Robetta, dear.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.676 position:50% align:center
You see, it doesn't
really matter to me

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
what kind of girl you are.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50% align:center
Take me on as your
apprentice! Please?

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:57.691 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And that's how
I met the Stardust Witch.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
From that day forward,
Miss Fran was my teacher.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
Oh! Good morning, Miss Fran!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
[FRAN yawns]
Yes, good morning.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
I'm starving, would
you mind making me

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
something for breakfast?

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
What are you hungry for?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.589 position:50% align:center
Excellent question.

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
A steak would be delightful!

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
It seems a little
heavy for breakfast.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.722 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] In that case,
I suppose weeds will do.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
I think that's probably
a little too light.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
Then how about
some fresh bread?

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
[FRAN hums]

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I'm off to pick
some wild veggies.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Um, Miss Fran,
do you think you could

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
please teach me some magic?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Maybe some other time. Farewell!

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
See you later.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] No matter how many days
I spent in the forest with her,

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran refused to teach
me anything about magic.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
Elaina, dear, I'm afraid
we've run out of food.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Could you make
a quick trip to town?

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Elaina, would you go
catch me five or so geckos?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
They're for my research.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Elaina dear, would you please
come and make us some dinner?

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.160 position:50% align:center
"Pain Killers." Let's see.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sniffs]

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:45.131 position:50% align:center
Elaina? There's a giant
spider in the bath.

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Can you please kill it?
They frighten me.

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
Gross, it's all
mixed in the soup?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
You don't like mushrooms?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.321 position:50% align:center
Witches should not
be picky eaters.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.575 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Elaina, would you
massage my shoulders?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
Ah! That feels great.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
So I've been wondering,

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
why won't you
teach me any magic?

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.393 position:50% align:center
Oh! Massage harder!

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
Ooh...

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And just like that,
an entire month passed by.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
She never taught me anything.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I've done nothing but chores

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
since I apprenticed to her.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
I mean, what am I
even doing here?

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran, is today the day

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
you finally teach
me about magic?

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
Magic?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
No, there isn't really
anything to teach you.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that so?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Also...

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.763 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like stew today.

00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
Would you make something else?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
As you wish.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Well, it seems the
time has finally come.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
Elaina.

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you
to take a little test.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Miss Fran, um,
what exactly are you testing?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] How well you do
in a fight against me.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.
That's just a joke, right?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
No, let's begin.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.033 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
[FRAN giggles]

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
That's how you wanna play?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.063 position:50% align:center
Okay, but you asked for it.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
[FRAN giggles]

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.298 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA screams]

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
She's trying to kill me!

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.210 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Aw, what's the matter?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
I must admit, I expected
much better from the girl

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.007 position:50% align:center
who overwhelmed everyone
at the magic exams.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Come on, let's
have some more fun.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA grunts]

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
My goodness. Finished already?

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Looks like the star student's

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
nothing to write home about.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
I... I'm so sorry.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.630 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you
would start crying.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sobs]

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
Uh, there, there, Elaina.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
I know! Look at this.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
The butterflies
you love so much!

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.606 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I'm not the one
who likes those butterflies!

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Oh, right. That's me. Uh...

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Voila!

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
A lovely crown made of weeds!

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
--[ELAINA] No thank you!
--[FRAN] Then, maybe...

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Ooh! Time for
some juggling! Cool, huh?

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.998 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow. Hot! Too hot!

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
[FRAN pants]

00:13:56.378 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
Well. That's clearly
not working so...

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
It's okay.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.720 position:50% align:center
Please, just let me go!

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:08.139 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to
smother me, here?

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, dear. Really, I am.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
I guess I took things
a little too far, huh?

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
You just tried to kill me!

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
And the worst part is,
you had fun doing it!

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Of course I wasn't having fun.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
Why would you lie like that?

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
You never planned
to make me a witch!

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
You're just like them!

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
I hate all of you!

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
I believed in you.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Endured everything
you put me through.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
Because I thought
you were different.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
But you're not.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
You're the same
as the other witches.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
I trusted you.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
You don't have any idea
how hard I worked!

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
None!

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was for you
to just acknowledge me.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
My apology was genuine.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
And I knew very well
how you felt.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
I'm proud of you
for enduring it.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
What are you saying?

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
Are you trying
to trick me again?

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
No. No more tricks.

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
No more games.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I've
reached my limit, too.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA gasps]

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
You should know, the only
reason I did all of this

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:24.549 position:50% align:center
was because your
parents asked me to.

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER]
I don't know what might happen

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.890 position:50% align:center
if Elaina keeps on like this,
and I'm worried that

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
one of these days, she's
going to take it too far.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] So, you want me to
take her on as my apprentice

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
in order to teach her
about failures, setbacks,

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
that sort of thing.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
We do.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
I don't know.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
Of course, we
wouldn't expect you

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
to do this for free. Miss Fran.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Money means little to me,

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.333 position:50% align:center
but if it will help your
daughter, how can I refuse?

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
After giving it careful thought,

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
I grudgingly accepted
your parents' request.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought I'd put
you through grueling trials,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
so you'd learn what it meant
to struggle through setbacks.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
Then I saw how
hardworking you are.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
You won't balk at any task

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
if it gets you closer
to achieving your goal.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
On top of that, you're very
talented and have no illusions

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
as to how other people see you.

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
I realized there was no
point in elaborate trials,

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
because you would just
endure them and rise again.

00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
But...

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
...that strength may very well
be your greatest weakness.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
You're willing to endure
too much, Elaina.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Far too much.

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
accept everything

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
that the world throws at you.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
If there's something you don't
like, stand up and fight it.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you'll need
to say, "No,"

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
and that's perfectly fine.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
Don't be afraid
to protect yourself.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] So, you haven't
taught me any magic

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
since I got here because...

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I was waiting for
you to reach your limit.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
It took a whole month
to get you there.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
The test today...
that was part of it.

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
Please believe that I'm sorry.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] "You don't have
to endure everything."

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
It was the first time
I'd ever been told that.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.594 position:50% align:center
You have great skill
and considerable talent.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
All you're lacking now is the
experience to help you use them.

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:40.185 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] That day,
my true training began.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
Real lessons and
new experiences.

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Miss Fran.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
How'd you sleep?

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Oh, you know. I can't complain.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
I'm starving, though.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Will you make me something
for breakfast, please?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Here. Already done.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Oh, my.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
And what did I do
to deserve that?

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
I'm only doing what
you told me to do.

00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
You said if there was
something I didn't like,

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
I should stand up and fight it.

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
It turns out, I don't
particularly like

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:08.880 position:50% align:center
cooking for you.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
I'm going to starve to death.

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding!

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
We have some stew
from yesterday,

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
and some hard bread
to go with it.

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
That'll work, right?

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Sure.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And so it went.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran continued to train me.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Some days were easy,
and some days were hard.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] But they were all
fulfilling, and so magical.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
You've become strong.
Very strong.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.447 position:50% align:center
That's the first time
I've ever beaten you.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] And that means
your training's over.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.034 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
You've worked hard this
past year and learned so much.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
There really isn't anything
left for me to teach you.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Elaina.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the ranks of witches.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
As the Stardust Witch,
I officially acknowledge you.

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Miss Fran.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
By the way, about your title.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
How do you feel about
"the Ashen Witch"?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get that idea?

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Your hair is the color of ash.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Uh... Shouldn't a title
be chosen for something

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
more important than hair color?

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
I don't know, I thought
it sounded pretty cool.

00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
Well, what about your name?

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
Why are you called
"the Stardust Witch"?

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
Because it's cool, obviously!

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
So, will you be
"the Ashen Witch"?

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.627 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. I guess so.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
All right, then,

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Ashen Witch, Elaina.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
And you'll continue
to do your best, right?

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess I'll be off now.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
Where to?

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] As it turned out,
there was a lot

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
I didn't know about Miss Fran.

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
Like the fact that she was
a distinguished witch

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
from another country.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] But then,
why did you come here?

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] There was someone
I wanted to meet.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] That's the
reason? And did you?

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
Meet them, I mean.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
I've enjoyed my time
here with you and I wish

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
I could stay longer,
but there are many people

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
waiting for my return back home.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, dear Elaina.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
Let's meet again someday.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[FRAN giggles]

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Goodbye,
Miss Fran! I'll miss you!

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
Well, um. I've done it.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
I've succeeded in
becoming a witch.

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to leave
on my journey.

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
You don't really
have to leave us

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center
right away, do you, Elaina?

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
You're serious about this?

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Then, go. It's time.

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER sobs]

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
That said, there are
three promises

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
I insist you keep.

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
First, if you ever feel like
you are in danger, run away.

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
Second, don't go around
thinking of yourself

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
as somebody special.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're the
same as everyone else.

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
And third, make sure
you come back to us

00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
one day, so you can tell us
all about your adventures.

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:19.631 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:21.716 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh-huh!

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.052 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER sobs]

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:26.388 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER]
Are you really leaving us?

00:22:26.471 --> 00:22:28.598 position:50% align:center
She's made her decision, dear.

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:31.142 position:50% align:center
Let's accept it and
see her off properly.

00:22:31.226 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
'Kay?

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:34.938 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
If you're like this now,

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:38.358 position:50% align:center
I worry the shock may kill you
when Elaina gets married.

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:45.240 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
It looks good on you.

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.867 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so, but
isn't it a little plain?

00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:49.244 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
I think it's exactly right

00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:50.620 position:50% align:center
for a young traveler.

00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:54.582 position:50% align:center
Here, take this,
too, just in case.

00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:56.543 position:50% align:center
It's the same as
the one I have on.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:57.752 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
You never know.

00:22:57.836 --> 00:22:59.379 position:50% align:center
The wind might blow it away.

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:00.714 position:50% align:center
So, a spare?

00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:01.840 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
A spare.

00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:04.384 position:50% align:center
Thank you, it's
perfect. Love it.

00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:07.053 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S MOTHER]
One more thing.

00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:11.599 position:50% align:center
It looks like a diary.

00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:13.435 position:50% align:center
I want you to keep
a record of your travels

00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:16.146 position:50% align:center
like Niké did, so that
when you come back to us,

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:19.357 position:50% align:center
I can hear your story
from start to finish.

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:21.860 position:50% align:center
I'll take good care of it, Mom.

00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:24.154 position:50% align:center
And I promise I'll
be back one day

00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:27.282 position:50% align:center
to tell about the journey
of the Ashen Witch.

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:28.658 position:50% align:center
Can't wait.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.828 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA'S FATHER sobbing]

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
Go have an adventure, Elaina.

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.790 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I will!

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And so, I set off on my journey.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.091 position:50% align:center
As the wind blew, as my
fancy led me, I traveled.

00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:49.637 position:50% align:center
Experiencing all the world had
to offer for three whole years.

00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:52.015 position:50% align:center
Now, here's a question for you:

00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:54.976 position:50% align:center
Who is the witch so beautiful
she'd steal your breath

00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:00.440 position:50% align:center
more surely than a swift flight
through a stark mountain range?

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:01.649 position:50% align:center
That's right--

00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:04.652 position:50% align:center
it's me, at age 18.
