"Now, this country was divided:

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
there was a left side
and a right side,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.809 position:50% align:center
and the two did not get along.

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
So, they built a wall.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
They agreed that they
would keep to themselves

Sometimes I wonder what

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
the point of this thing is.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
[NIKÉ] Isn't the "point" of a
wall fairly straightforward?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
[GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL 07A] Well,
yes, it was originally built

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
to keep the two sides apart
since they have no desire

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
to interact, and it
certainly does that.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:49.716 position:50% align:center
But think of all
the opportunities

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
we're missing with it here.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.552 position:50% align:center
[NIKÉ]
Oh.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
We want to make sure

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
we're still winning
against the other side.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.099 position:50% align:center
But how are we supposed to
prove to them that we're better

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center

prevents them from seeing us?

And what is the meaning
of this message?

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[NIKÉ] Well, this wall
represents the rivalry

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
between the left and right.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.311 position:50% align:center
But you also want it
to represent this side's

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.147 position:50% align:center
superiority over the
other, do you not?

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
[NIKÉ] My suggestion is,
you encourage travelers

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.947 position:50% align:center
who visit to carve words
of praise into the wall.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.740 position:50% align:center
The more etchings on this side,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
the more it will prove that
it's favored over the other.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
Uh... I don't know--

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.747 position:50% align:center
that's not really how we
do things around here.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.207 position:50% align:center
[NIKÉ]
That's too bad.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50% align:center
Because I've already seen
the other side of the wall,

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.877 position:50% align:center
and it's covered in
glowing remarks

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.337 position:50% align:center

in their wake.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.973 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's just too bad,
because I've seen the other side

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
of the wall, and it's already
covered in glowing remarks

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.992 position:50% align:center

their own words of praise."

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] But why did it
matter if the travelers

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
carved words on the wall or not?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
I suppose it was essentially
a popularity contest.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
Popularity contest?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
It's a way of choosing the
one that people like more.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
If one side had more etchings
than the other one did,

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
then they could say they
had proof that travelers

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
liked them better.
Does that make sense?

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. So, who won?

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
Which of the sides turned out
to be more popular?

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
And how many more nice words

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
did they have than
the other side did?

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center

You're intimidated

No, wait. She's not like
a child, she actually is one.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
You convinced a child
to play dress-up

and step lovingly
on some grapes,

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center

enough to beat me?

about a million grapes today.

[THIS VILLAGE CHIEF 07A]
Let's see...

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
I would say we're looking
at around half a cask.

That's it?

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.988 position:50% align:center

that stomping? Ugh.

The life of a

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
certainly not an easy one.

What about that stuff?
How much have they sold?

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not sure of the
exact number, but it's a lot.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Maybe even thousands
of bottles by now.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
Based on today, I'd say
Rosemary would have to spend

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
every waking moment of her life
stomping grapes in order

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.677 position:50% align:center
to produce that many
bottles, and even then,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
it might not be enough.

I can't believe it!

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
The wine we thought was imbued
with the essence of Rosemary

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:00.116 position:50% align:center
was in fact stomped by
the feet of those large men.

stepped on the grapes?

Oh, my. I've never
had a glass of wine

It's the connection
that's so important.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.384 position:50% align:center
Even if the flavor is still the
same, the experience isn't

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
because Rosemary wasn't the one

hit every last one of us.

came to, we discovered

that the witch had already left.

Oh...

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
[THIS VILLAGE CHIEF 07A]
And that's the story

of how the Grape-Throwing
Festival began.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
Turned out it was a good
way to release stress.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center
