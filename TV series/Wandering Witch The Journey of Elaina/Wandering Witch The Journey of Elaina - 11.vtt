I understand why you'd

I should probably help out, too,

was inside that box, anyway?

more of a curse.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center

to depend on people, right?

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
So I decided to
separate these two;

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center

always around the same people.

Yeah. I guess
that makes sense.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
I just assumed Mina
was tired of Saya.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
And went back home because
she was so annoyed.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
Quite the opposite actually,

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
Mina wouldn't let me
hear the end of it.

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
She shouted things like "Why'd
you make me leave my sister?"

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
and "I'll never forgive
you for this!"

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center

threatened to curse me.

she was a pretty
carefree individual.

[ELAINA]
Seriously?

00:22:57.794 --> 00:22:59.921 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Just like you're
a carefree individual.

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:01.673 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I don't understand.

00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:04.175 position:50% align:center
I guess what I'm saying is,
there's no reason

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:07.220 position:50% align:center
for you to worry about every
little thing in this life.

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:09.014 position:50% align:center
That said, I do
hope that one day

00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:11.933 position:50% align:center
you'll find the time to go back
to your home for a visit.

00:23:12.017 --> 00:23:14.686 position:50% align:center
Yes. One day.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:16.354 position:50% align:center
Don't forget, okay?

00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:17.689 position:50% align:center
And remember,

00:23:17.772 --> 00:23:19.774 position:50% align:center
you're always in our
thoughts and hearts, Elaina.

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:20.734 position:50% align:center
We'll always love you.

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:22.861 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:24.237 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case...

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.322 position:50% align:center
...I guess I should say...

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:28.616 position:50% align:center
...that I love you,
too, Miss Fran.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
Everyone in my life.

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Take care!

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] There are five volumes
in <i>The Adventures of Nik√©</i> .

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:47.135 position:50% align:center
And while I've always loved
them, I also imagined that

00:23:47.218 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
my story would be
a lot longer than that.

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:51.931 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:53.933 position:50% align:center
In the country where
Miss Fran and Sheila

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:56.936 position:50% align:center
were able to finally be
honest with each other,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.440 position:50% align:center
I discovered something
about myself, too.

00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:04.861 position:50% align:center
I want to keep going,
to keep being the Ashen Witch.

00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:08.490 position:50% align:center
An ordinary traveler,
enjoying my journey.
