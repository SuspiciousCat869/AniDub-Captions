[ELAINA]
The Land of Truth Tellers?

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
But the map says this is...

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 06A] Yes, the name
changed about six months back.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
As the new name suggests,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
we have become
a country with no liars.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Huh.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 06B]
Once you cross this threshold,

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
you will no longer
be able to lie.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
Even if you're a witch.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
How in the world
did you find yourselves

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.994 position:50% align:center
in this situation?

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
Well, it's all to do
with the mysterious

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
magical power of the
king's sword, you see.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Sword?

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 06B] That sword
is brimming with magic.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
He used it to place a barrier
around the entire country

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.381 position:50% align:center
that prohibits those
within from lying.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.259 position:50% align:center
That sounds kind of
shady if you ask me.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
You're already starting to be
honest of your own accord.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
And frankly, I'm inclined
to agree with you, miss.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
So what would you
like to do next?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
Will you stay and visit?

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Let me think.

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
On one hand, the whole thing
is highly suspicious.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
But on the other, I suppose
it could make a good story.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.027 position:50% align:center
So it couldn't hurt
to take a quick look.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center
You are an honest one.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
Step this way into the
Land of Truth Tellers, miss.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
[SENTRIES]
Welcome to our damned country!

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] For a country ruled
by such powerful magic,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
it looks kind of boring.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
Not really what I pictured.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose I could put

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
the king's barrier to the test.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
I'll trying saying
"I am not beautiful,"

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
and we'll see what happens.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
A-hem. Regrettably,
I am not a beautiful...

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.368 position:50% align:center
I'm not!

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.537 position:50% align:center
I'm-- I am an unbelievably
beautiful witch!

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps] How about that,
my mouth corrected me

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
all on its own!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.379 position:50% align:center
For some reason,
I didn't believe them

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
when they said that the rule
even applied to witches.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
As long as we're
being honest, though...

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
It's a little too
quiet for my liking.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
[CUSTOMER 06A]
Mm... mm!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It's weird.
I wonder why no one's talking.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
Those look good.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, are these
freshly baked?

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:58.238 position:50% align:center
[SELLER 06A]
Mm-hm.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
Perfect, I'll take one, then.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Are you kidding?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
This is so hard and dry,
it's practically stale.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
It's probably unsold
bread from yesterday.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
But she made it sound
like these were fresh.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
Some honest country this
is turning out to be.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
When they told me no one
here could lie anymore,

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
I assumed that meant the people
would be more "pure," somehow.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I guess
I was wrong.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.932 position:50% align:center
Instead, everybody seems
so distant and cold.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
And every interaction
is just so strained.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.021 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I wonder what made the king

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
decide to control his
subjects like this.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
And if it was worth it.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.192 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
"You're the witch dispatched

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
from the United Magic
Association, right?"

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
You're looking for someone else.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
For the unaware,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
The United Magic Association
is an organization

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
that sends representatives
to settle magical disputes

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
around the world.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
Association witches
have an extra brooch.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
It's the easiest way
to pick 'em out.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
They're shaped
like a moon. Sorry.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
Well, that was a bit odd.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
If this enchantment is really
as strong as it appears to be,

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:17.359 position:50% align:center
then I wonder if it applies
to written text as well.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
"New sweets available!

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
Actually, we just added some new
ingredients to old products."

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
"A mystery woven
by a brand new author!

it turned out to be!" I see.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
Hm... I'll try it myself.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
Let me see, I'll write
something like

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
"I have a twisted personality"
and see if it changes.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
It's still shady, but I can't
deny this spell is incredible.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
[MAN 06A] What the hell
is your problem?

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center

Oh, goodness.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
I finally hear some voices,

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
and it turns out to be
whatever this is.

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:10.078 position:50% align:center
Um, shouldn't someone
try to stop them?

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
Uh-- It's fine,
they help the rest of us

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
blow off some steam.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
I actually wish they'd
fight more often.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
Huh. That's one way
of looking at it.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
Why is everyone in this country
so reluctant to speak out loud?

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
[MAN 06C] Come on,
you have to know by now

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
that it's impossible
to lie here.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50% align:center
So if we try to talk
to each other,

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
we just end up fighting
like they are.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
For a witch,
you sure are stupid.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
There, you see?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
We used to be peaceful--

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
all this is the fault
of our idiot king.

I never dared to dream that
I might run into you here!

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
This obviously means
we have no choice

but to get married immediately!

I'm not sure about that,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
but it's certainly been
a long time, hasn't it?

I'm glad that you seem
to be doing well.

Yes, thanks to this hat.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.136 position:50% align:center
And this! My most
prized possession.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
I'm doing extremely well!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
Hey. Isn't that mine?

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
And I even became
a full-fledged witch!

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can see that.
Congratulations.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
So, tell me. What
title did you take?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
I'm the Charcoal Witch!

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
Charcoal Witch, huh?

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
That sounds oddly close
to my "Ashen Witch" title,

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
don't you think?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
You bet it does,

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
and that's no
coincidence, by the way.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
'Cause I specifically
requested that my teacher

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
choose a word close to "ashen."

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
Of course you did.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
So I take it you're part of the
United Magic Association, right?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wanted to travel
around like you do

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
and still make some money,
so I figured the Association

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.172 position:50% align:center
was the easiest way to do it.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.299 position:50% align:center
In fact, I came here
on official business!

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
Yep! I bought something
expensive recently

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't really afford,

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
so I need to pull
some extra hours.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
I met someone earlier today

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
who was looking for a witch
from the Association.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
Great, can you
tell me who it was?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I couldn't find
a name or address anywhere

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
in the request I received.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 06C] Back again,
you incompetent waste of magic?

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
Get out of my sight, right now!

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 06C]
I'm not reading that.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Please don't tell me
it's the weirdo over there.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
It's the weirdo over there.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
In any case, do you maybe
want to let go of me?

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
No. I'm all right
just like this.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
Excuse us.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
You've been looking for a witch

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:14.471 position:50% align:center
dispatched by the
Association, have you not?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
Wonderful, then please
allow me to introduce you

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
to my friend Saya.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
Come on, "friend"
is a little too formal,

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
don't you think? Well,
hello there, friend.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
"I'm Eihemia.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.946 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I completely forgot
to write my name and address

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
in the letter I sent to you."

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
Please, Miss Eihemia.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Tell us why it is
you have a notepad.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
Is it that you can't talk to us?
Or that you won't talk to us?

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
"It's kind of a lengthy story,
but I lost my voice."

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
going to write down

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
the entire story?

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy, this is gonna
take a long time, isn't it?

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
Saya, be nice.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And so the poor voiceless witch

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
told us her tale of woe.
Or rather, she scribbled it.

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
From what we could understand...

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
About six months ago,

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.773 position:50% align:center
while Eihemia was still
employed at the palace,

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
she received a request
from the king.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
Heed my words,
Quicksand Witch, Eihemia.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.029 position:50% align:center
and use whatever
power you see fit

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
to rid my country
of all its liars.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
My retainers have rarely
been truthful with me.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,
I wish to be surrounded

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
only by those who are
completely honest.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
[EIHEMIA] I don't even
know where to begin.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
But if I can figure out
some way to do what he asks,

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.801 position:50% align:center
then maybe we could...

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
I can dream. Right?

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
Wait a second.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.811 position:50% align:center
I can just put up a barrier
that won't let anyone lie.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Eihemia found a sword
in the castle that she thought

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
would make a suitable vessel
for the amount of magic

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
that such a barrier
would require.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
All right, then. Ianesana-ha.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
Ianesana-ha.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
Ominano motera-do!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] But she underestimated
the amount of power

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.546 position:50% align:center
she would need to cast
a spell of this magnitude.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
She poured in
everything she had.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
It still wasn't enough.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
And in a last-ditch effort
to complete the barrier.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
She even gave up her voice.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
Yes, in hindsight,
I could have seen that coming.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Why do desperate people always

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.856 position:50% align:center
give up their
voices or memories?

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
Nevermind, I'm just
talking to myself.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
[TRUTH KING]
Oh? An intriguing solution.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
As long as I possess
this magic sword,

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
I can activate a barrier
around my entire country

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.330 position:50% align:center
that will prevent all lying?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.168 position:50% align:center
A land full of
nothing but truth-tellers.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
It's perfect.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.094 position:50% align:center
[TRUTH KING]
But I have to say,

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:00.762 position:50% align:center
this sword is really lame.

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Uh--?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.807 position:50% align:center
[TRUTH KING]
It's so gaudy.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
I know it's necessary,
but I hate that I have to

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.061 position:50% align:center
hold onto something this tacky.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:15.235 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And so, that's how the
Land of Truth Tellers was born.

00:12:15.318 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
Of course, since Eihemia
could no longer use magic

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
after gifting the
king his new sword,

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
she ultimately ended up getting
kicked out of the palace.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
I mean, to be fair, you were
hired to be a witch.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
What did you think was going to
happen if you lost your magic?

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.677 position:50% align:center
You gave up your
voice and your magic

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
just to please him?

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.555 position:50% align:center
That's a lot of
emotional baggage.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Knowing all that probably made
the king really uncomfortable.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Uh...

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
So, your request is
to put this country

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
back to the way it
was before, right?

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed to get
things back to normal, though?

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:01.781 position:50% align:center
Oh, I gotcha.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
So you want me to attack the
king and destroy the sword

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:05.410 position:50% align:center
next time he leaves
the castle, right?

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
Ah! That's perfect!
Elaina and I can share a room

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
for the next month;
we'll eat and sleep together

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
and brush each other's hair!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.795 position:50% align:center
Oh, and we can save water
by bathing together, too.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
We'll go to the bathroom...

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
[muffled]

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
Let's move up the
timeline a little.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Okay, but if
we can't actually lie,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
then how are we ever
going to get inside?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.477 position:50% align:center
I mean, it doesn't look like we
can just fly in from the sky,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.771 position:50% align:center
and ground security will be
pretty tight, I'm guessing.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
Well, we are in a
Land of Truth Tellers,

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
so lying to gain access to the
palace is not really an option.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
Except...

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
Except what?

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
I think we'll be needing
that notepad of yours.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
We will?

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
It's said that a picture

00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
is worth a thousand
words. Right?

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
[DOORMAN 06A]
What business do you have here?

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Sorry but you may not
enter the palace

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
without express permission
from the king.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.091 position:50% align:center
Wait. You came back again?

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
You were banished from here,
don't you remember?

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Go on, Saya.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
Explain the situation
to the guard.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:10.892 position:50% align:center
Of course, Elaina.

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
A-hem. Mister Doorman, sir,

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
do you understand the words
that we wrote down for you here?

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
"The banishment of Eihemia
has been rescinded.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
She's to enter the castle
with the Ashen Witch, Elaina

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
and the Charcoal Witch."

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
"We have permission from
the king of this country."

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
Are you serious? No way!
You're lying to me, aren't you?

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.333 position:50% align:center
How can you ask that in
the Land of Truth Tellers?

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
I thought that lying in
this country was impossible.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
[DOORMAN 06A]
That's true.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
Meaning that you'll
let us enter?

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Wow, I can't
believe that worked!

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
You really are a
genius, Miss Elaina.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
It was actually simple.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
We just had to write the
sentences down in chunks.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
Since none of the parts
contained any lies specifically,

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
they could be written down.

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
Then, they just had to be
read in the correct order.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
You could write practically
anything at all,

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.821 position:50% align:center
and the people here
would believe it.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
Just like they say, the pen
is mightier than the sword!

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
We might find out soon enough.

00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
Welp, it's all up
to you, Eihemia.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
Lead the way to the
infamous throne room!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
Hello there, creepy shadow
man, are you the king?

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Indeed I am.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
Please let go of
that sword, Sire.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
Do as she says.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
[TRUTH KING]
Guards!

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.147 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy, the intruders
are three witches.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
Look, one of them's Eihemia!
Hey, long time no see!

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
Ugh this is such
a pain and I'm tired.

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
The pretty flat chested
gray-haired one's my favorite.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
I think the boyish
girl's my type.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.950 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry buddy,
unfortunately for you,

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
my heart already
belongs to another.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
Please don't look at me
when you say that.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
More importantly,
I'm going to need your help

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
with handling all of the guards.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
That way I can focus on getting
the truth sword from the king.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:03.588 position:50% align:center
You can count on Saya,
the Charcoal Witch!

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
It's over, drop the sword!

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
It's not over!

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
This sword is my greatest
achievement as a king,

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
and with it, I shall rule
this land with verity!

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
As long as I have it
in my hand,

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
I can lead the country
in the right direction.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
I'll never let it go!

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
[SAYA groans]

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
[SAYA screams]

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Saya.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
What a meanie head!

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Yeah, thanks
for the late warning!

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
[growls, grunts]

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
[SAYA yells]

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
Prepare to die!

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
Tell me something, Truth King!

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
Did getting rid of lies
make this country better?

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Of course! Isn't that obvious?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
The people don't like
what you've done to them!

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
Wait, what did you say?

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
Sure, the people in
your country can't lie,

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't
mean evil people

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
won't keep doing bad things.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
It's true that
you became a country

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
full of truth tellers,
but this spell of yours

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
can't just magically make
everybody in it a better person.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:15.744 position:50% align:center
Just because people
lie doesn't mean

00:17:15.827 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
they're inherently evil or bad.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.498 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you need to lie so you
don't hurt someone's feelings

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
or ruin a relationship
that's important to you.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
Without those little white lies,

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
people will grate
on each other's nerves,

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
and it causes them to fight.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
That's not true!

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
If the sword is truth,
then lies are like scabbards!

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
Sheathe it, Sire!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
"Saya"?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
I said "Sire."

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
Can you just focus
on the guards please?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
Ugh, you're always so bossy.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
Stick and stones.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
So if the sword represents truth

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
and lies act as a scabbard:

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:46.441 position:50% align:center
They keep us from swinging
words around recklessly

00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
and hurting other people.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
We use lies to keep
the truth inside.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.781 position:50% align:center
How dare you!
Don't lecture me, witch!

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] I hate to interrupt you,
but there are too many guards

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
and I'm running out of juice!

00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
If I keep going like this,
my head might actually explode!

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
Well then, it appears
that poor Saya

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
has reached her limit.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Let's end this fight, shall we?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, end it?

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
Seems like you've used
everything you have

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
just to hold back my attacks.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you're
wrong on that front.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
I've been prepared to take
that sword from you

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
for a while now.
You can see for yourself.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
No! My tacky sword is gone!

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
Good job, Miss Elaina!
You broke the spell!

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:50.588 position:50% align:center
Is it true?

00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
Was I actually wrong
this entire time?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
[EIHEMIA]
No, Your Majesty.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
Your voice came back.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
I truly believe your
desire for honesty arose

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:09.357 position:50% align:center
from the best of intentions.

00:19:09.441 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
I also believe that
you would benefit

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
from relaxing a little bit.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:16.948 position:50% align:center
The country won't fall apart if
its people aren't always honest.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
You can still make it
a great place to live.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggle]

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS chattering]

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
Fresh bread, baked
just this morning!

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
Come and see, I've got
the tastiest fish

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
in the whole city!

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Hey, you know what,

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
I think you're actually
a pretty decent brother!

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
Aw, thanks! I don't
even remember

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50% align:center
what we were fighting about!

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] The king recognized
the error of his ways

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
and apologized to the
citizens of his country

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
for making it so they
could never tell a lie.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
I don't know if the
country will ever

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
be able to go back to how
it was, but with Eihemia

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:08.667 position:50% align:center
back at the palace,
I'm sure it'll all work out.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
One way or another. We'll see.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Madam Witches.
Thank you so much for your help!

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
Please have a pleasant journey!

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Yeah, so...

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
According to the association's
rules, I'm supposed to give you

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
a present to thank
you for your help.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
Well, don't worry about it.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
Besides, if you do everything
strictly by the book,

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
you won't be able to
improvise if you need to.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
But I already got
something for you!

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
It's nothing that big, I swear.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
Ta-dah!

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
It looks like a necklace.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
'Cause it is.
It's pretty, right?

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
This thing cost me
every coin I had,

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
and I've been waiting and
waiting to see you again

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.704 position:50% align:center
so I could give it to you.

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
It's strange, but the
whole reason I had to take

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
this job was because
I ran out of money.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
But then that same
job led me here,

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
and I finally got to see
you again, so it's like fate!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll treasure it
forever and always think of me!

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay. Thank you.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
It's a very thoughtful gift.

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
Here, let me put
it on for you.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can do it.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:06.349 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Nah, it's easier this way.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
Ah! Oh, yeah, it looks amazing!

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.698 position:50% align:center
And see! Now we're matching!

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway.

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:29.205 position:50% align:center
I should head back to the
association branch office.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.790 position:50% align:center
Where will you go next?

00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
That's the joy
of being a traveler.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
Back home, hooking your
pinky with someone else's

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
symbolizes a promise.

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
Will you make a pinky
promise with me?

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
Let's promise we'll
meet again someday.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:56.066 position:50% align:center
And maybe I can even
introduce you to my sister.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
And...

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be a much
better witch by then!

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
Promise me, Elaina!

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:07.202 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for that day while
I continue on my travels.

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:08.828 position:50% align:center
Pinky Promise.
