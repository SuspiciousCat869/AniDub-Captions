[ELAINA gasps]

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
That's the doll's hair.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
The doll?

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.331 position:50% align:center
There was a doll sitting
on my nightstand,

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
but I moved it
in there, instead.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
I thought as much.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
You thought what, exactly?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] All the incidents seem
to follow the same pattern.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
Every victim is attacked
while they're sleeping,

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
a doll from their room
disappears, but, strangely,

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
some of its hair
gets left behind.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:25.852 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] I assume they
took the doll's hair out

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
to replace it with the victim's.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
That's odd.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] It could be
a means of controlling

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
the dolls with magic.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
So, what now?

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Why are you asking me?

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Are you going to
investigate or not?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.618 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm going to!

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
Let's catch that coward,
cut off their head,

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
and send them to hell
to think long and hard

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
about what they did!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a bit extreme.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Is something wrong?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
Uh, no.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
I was just noticing
how scrawny you are.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Well, shall we be off?

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
Sorry, remind me what
your name is again.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
I told you that already.
I'm Elaina. The Ashen Witch.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
Now, Let's go.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
[INNKEEPER 08A]
Have a nice day!

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Look at the hair on that doll.

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
The texture and sheen are
beautiful, aren't they?

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess they are.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
It actually kinda
reminds me of human hair.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
Now, if you wish to remain
unscathed, then you'll tell us

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
exactly how this doll came
to be in your possession.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:45.682 position:50% align:center
I thought so.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
This really is
human hair, isn't it?

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
Come on! Spit it out!

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
I got her at a secret auction!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Secret auction, eh?

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes.

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
It's an underground event where
they sell custom-made dolls,

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
like my dear Little A there.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
This is getting
creepier by the second.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
And where, pray tell,

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
is this illicit
affair being held?

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
We're not far now.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
Is it so wrong for me
to feel a little excited?

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
If you only hide your eyes,

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
isn't it sort of obvious
who's behind the mask?

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
It's the spirit of the thing
that's really important, here.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
When you conceal part of your
face, doesn't it make you feel

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
a bit like you're doing
something you shouldn't be?

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] No. The fact
that it's a secret auction

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
makes me feel like I'm doing
something I shouldn't.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.522 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Oh, hush.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
It has the feel of an old
opera house, doesn't it?

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
Apparently that's precisely
what it used to be.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
The wait is nearly over,
my sweet little Masa,

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
we're going to get you
a girlfriend today for sure!

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
I need to win, I wanna win,
I have to win, I'm gonna win!

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
I've been pinching pennies

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
ever since I blew my chance
at the last auction.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to leave
until I win her!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
Who's my cutesy-wootsy.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Ugh, you can smell
the desperation.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
how anyone can get

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
this worked up about some dolls.

00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
I don't get it, either.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
Though I suppose I can see
the appeal of owning something

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:19.859 position:50% align:center
unorthodox that isn't
sold in broad daylight.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
Welcome, one and all,
to tonight's special event!

what's on the
block this evening!

If you've got the money,
we've got the dolls.

Are you ready?

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.130 position:50% align:center
And now, without further ado...

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
Feast your eyes on
our first item tonight!

[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
Uh... "Unorthodox" may
be an understatement.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.273 position:50% align:center
Not what I expected.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center

Fifty!

One hundred!

I hear 100 over here,
going once, twice.

One-fifty!

[BIDDER 08A]
Three hundred!

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
Three hundred!
Sold to the fat one!

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
She's ours!

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
I wonder if all the dolls
will be life-size like that one.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
Surely not.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
I imagine those must
be pretty rare.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
[AUCTIONEER 08A]
We'll start the bidding at 250!

[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
It is the same, but worse.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
Next up on the block:

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
this scintillating minx!

[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I vote we just leave.

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.647 position:50% align:center
[AUCTIONEER 08A]
Now then, everyone.

00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
It is my sincere pleasure
to present to you

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
the crowning jewel of
tonight's festivities.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Here we go.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE clammoring]

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
You see the one with
the ash-colored hair.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
She really looks like the doll

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
that was in my room
back at the inn.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
No way is that a coincidence,
that has to be her.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
Which means that's my hair!

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
Look closely!

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
To make these dolls look
even more realistic,

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
we've wefted them with 100%
authentic human hair!

[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
I suppose that confirms
it's all the victims' hair.

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
E-Easy, now.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
How dare they steal from me.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
Every last one of them
deserves to die!

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, settle down.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
The bidders don't know
how the hair was obtained.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
They're not to blame.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
And if that's not enough,

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.958 position:50% align:center
these came straight from
the talk of the town:

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
the Ripper! So how about it?

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
Ugh, damn it.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
They're making it hard
to be forgiving.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
Ready, folks? Let
the bidding begin!

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
[BIDDER 08A]
What is she doing?

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
[BIDDER 08B] Her hair is
the same color as the doll's.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
[BIDDER 08AA]
Do you think she's a victim?

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.577 position:50% align:center
All of you are
enemies of women.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.871 position:50% align:center
For that crime alone
you deserve to die,

00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
but I believe the Ripper
is also among us tonight.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:23.001 position:50% align:center
Come out and face
me, you coward.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
Not going to show yourself?

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
All righty then.

[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
How 'bout now?

[AUDIENCE screams]

Please, stop!

I can't watch!

[AUDIENCE gasps]

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
[DOLL STORE OWNER 08A]
That's quite enough.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
Would you kindly
refrain from being

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
so horrible to my creation?

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
So it was you all along.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Yep! It was me!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
The moment you set foot
in my shop, I thought,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
"That hair is so lovely,
I can't do without it!"

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
And you claimed that you
didn't care about money.

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
But that's because your
plan was to strike it rich

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
at the secret auction.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
No, dear.

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
Money itself truly
doesn't interest me.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
Sure, I turn a profit at these
events, quite a bit in fact,

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
but I immediately donate
every cent to the poor!

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
So why bother with
this Ripper business?

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
I thought you said you loved
to see people's smiling faces.

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
I promise, none of your crimes
left the victims smiling.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
You don't understand.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.041 position:50% align:center
Then explain it!

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
I meant it when I said I adore
seeing people's happy faces.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
The bidders here love my
special human-hair dolls enough

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
to pay hundreds, and when
I donate that money,

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
it makes everyone
happy, happy, happy!

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
And their faces are so divine!

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
But oh, I would be
remiss to ignore

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
the beauty of faces
that are sad.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
Or ones full of fury!

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
Or in fits of laughter
do you get it now?

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
Expressions of human emotion

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
are really wonderful,
aren't they?

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
Oh, I can't contain
it any longer!

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.947 position:50% align:center
That look of pure
anger on your face

00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
is almost more than I can stand.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
No, stop. That's enough.
I'd like to get this over with.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[DOLL STORE OWNER 08A]
Apologies, Miss Mage,

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
but I'm actually a witch.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.627 position:50% align:center
I'm not someone a child
can win against.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Oh. No, I'm a witch, too.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Which means, this is
the end for you, Ripper.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] Well, that was
a very exciting evening.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Elaina.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
Believe me,
it was my pleasure.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
[screams] Wait! What are
you gonna do with me?

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.918 position:50% align:center
Ooh, are you still angry?
Let me see you get madder!

00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
I want to see what wrath
looks like on you!

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
No, show me your face!

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And just like that,

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
the case was closed.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
The culprit was apprehended

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
by the Night Witch, Sheila.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.284 position:50% align:center
And taken to a branch of
the United Magic Association.

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
I still vote for
the death penalty.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
I'm going in to collect
the reward for you.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
You think you can wait
here nice and quiet?

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
Does it feel good
to get the reward?

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
Show me.

00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
Let me see your
expression of radiant joy!

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Hey, is that you, Teach?

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
Were you waiting there
for me to get back?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
No, I haven't been
here for very long.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
I'm almost out of
money again, though.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
So I came to find work.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
Where in the world did
you pick this crazy one up?

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.784 position:50% align:center
I can't say I like the "stranger
danger" way she's looking at me.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
[DOLL STORE OWNER 08A]
Oh, you're so adorable!

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
And I bet your mad
face is even cuter!

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
It's a long story.
She's special.

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
If you must know,

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
she's the Ripper,
who cut off women's hair

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
and used it for creepy dolls.

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
She's so evil, in fact,
she even stole the hair

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
of a traveling witch.

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold on, did you
say a traveling witch?

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:45.972 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Indeed.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
She had a pointy hat and
a necklace that looked

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
just like yours, and
beautiful ashen hair.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
[SAYA gasps] 

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
She had ash-colored hair?

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
The same necklace.

00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:59.110 position:50% align:center
Would you look at that face?

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
Even though we're
perfect strangers,

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center
I can still read the
anger in your eyes.

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:09.287 position:50% align:center
I suggest you start
talking right now.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.295 position:50% align:center
[moans] That expression
of pure rage. Delicious!

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:19.214 position:50% align:center
[moans]
