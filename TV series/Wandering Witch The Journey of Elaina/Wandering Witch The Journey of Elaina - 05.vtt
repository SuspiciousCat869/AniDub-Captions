00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
I wonder if this book is like
<i>The Adventures of Niké</i> .

Wait. The illustration
inside the book

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
and that, if you're ever
near your hometown,

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
she would love it
if you would visit.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:01.518 position:50% align:center
I'm planning on it.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.603 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Good!

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
Elaina?

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I'm curious what made
you want to become a traveler.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it was
because of your mother?

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
My mother, why?

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. Does that
mean I'm wrong?

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
Actually, I was
inspired to become one

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
because of a book I read
when I was younger

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
called <i>The Adventures of Niké</i> .

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence! I'm a fan
of that book, as well.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
My favorite story
is the last one titled

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.336 position:50% align:center
"Foula, the Apprentice Witch."

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
Wow, that one is
my favorite, too!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
In it, the protagonist, Niké,

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
takes on an apprentice
witch named Foula,

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
determined to help her grow
into her full power.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
In the end, Niké moves
to the countryside

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.436 position:50% align:center
to live as an ordinary woman.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
Foula becomes the new traveler,

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
and Niké bids farewell
to her life of adventure.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
That sure takes me back.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
Oh, I mean,
to reading this book!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
Can I tell you a secret?

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
--[ELAINA] Uh...
--[FRAN] I um...

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I was so inspired
by <i>The Adventures of Niké</i>

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
that I wrote a novel about
my travels, as well.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Oh. How fascinating.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
I'm sorry, am I boring you?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
No, not at all.
I was just thinking

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
about something else.
Please continue.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] After I'd written about
100 pages of the manuscript,

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
I went back and read it.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
It was so bad,
I collapsed to the floor,

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
writhing in embarrassment.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Wow.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.604 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I stuffed it in my
travel bag and forgot about it.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
Which would have been no
problem except that, one day,

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
I was visiting a certain country
and decided to sell my bag.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Uh...

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I hadn't known it,
but apparently the bag

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
belonged to a
legendary traveler.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
A legendary traveler, huh?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Which is odd, because I'd
just bought it in a pawnshop.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And let me guess,
when you sold it,

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
you left your manuscript inside.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
How'd you figure that out?

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
You didn't leave very
much to the imagination.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I remember the whole
incident from time to time

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
and feel positively humiliated!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
What if someone found
the manuscript and read it?

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA chuckles]
Miss Fran.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, as
embarrassing as it is,

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
at least I can
laugh about it now.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
So, was there a point

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.521 position:50% align:center
I was supposed to get
from that story?

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised it isn't obvious.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
You'll have many
unpredictable adventures

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.153 position:50% align:center
as you continue on your journey.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.363 position:50% align:center
And someday,

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
you'll have just as many
stories as Niké did.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
So I want you to promise

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
that you'll come
and tell me them all.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
Can you do that for me?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think I can.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] And be sure
to write in your diary.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Did my mom
tell you I have a diary?

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] She's looking
forward to reading it.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
And so am I, very much.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.134 position:50% align:center
Then, I'll make sure
to write a lot

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
so I don't let you down.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Everyone.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
I believe you met her yesterday,
but let me introduce her again.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
This young lady here is
the Ashen Witch, Elaina.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
Uh, nice to meet you all.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.315 position:50% align:center
She's going to be a
special guest lecturer

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
for our lesson today.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
questions to ask her?

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
I do!

00:12:58.903 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Go on.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
Hello there! You seeing anybody?

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
I'm unattached.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
I travel far too much.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Can we keep it to questions
about magic, please?

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
Anyone else?

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes. Over here.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
Well, um. What kind of
stuff are you good at?

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
Like, magic-wise?

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
I'm good at pretty
much everything.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
From attacks all the
way to transforming.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
I have a pretty good handle
on all kinds of magic.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
Right. Thank you so much.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
Of all the countries
you've visited so far,

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
which one of them would
you say is your favorite?

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
Probably this country.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
Yes, Miss Fran?

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
You're trying to
flatter us, aren't you?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
No, I'm perfectly serious.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
Where did you come
from, originally?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
The peaceful country of Robetta.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 05A]
Is it fun being a traveler?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes! Extremely.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
[FLIR]
My turn!

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
What about your panties?

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
What co--

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT]
Come on.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.753 position:50% align:center
--[FRAN giggles]
--[ELAINA] Uh...

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
For the rest of that day,

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
I instructed the students
alongside Miss Fran.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] The flow of your
magic is going wild.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
So you need to try
and calm your mind more

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
in order to stabilize
your magic.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:20.276 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Excuse me, this isn't a game,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
so stop making water swords.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[HANSO]
Miss Elaina.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
I can't get my water to
form into a proper sphere.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.538 position:50% align:center
I'm not quite sure
what I'm doing wrong.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:34.124 position:50% align:center
Oh, the problem here
is an excess of power.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
You might try relaxing
your magic a bit.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
Right. Just relax it. Okay.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
Maybe not quite that much.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
[FLIR laughs]

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
Uh... Miss?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
I have something I'd like you
to help me out with, too.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes, what is it?

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm terrible
at manipulating water.

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.646 position:50% align:center
Like, I can barely
lift it up at all.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Can't figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
Could you give me
a little demonstration?

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
[MOUS]
Huh? I can do that.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
You weren't kidding.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
Will you tell me
where I'm messing up?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.833 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It looks like
you haven't quite

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
gotten the hang of it yet.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
For you, maybe we should just
focus on getting the water

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
out of the bucket first.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
[MOUS]
Oh, okay.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Once you get the water out...

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.971 position:50% align:center
...return it to the bucket.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
And then pull it out again.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
Does that make sense?

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, I think so.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
"Progress not perfection!"

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
Keep at it, and you'll
be better in no time!

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right!

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much
for your help, ma'am!

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:45.487 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Of course!

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[FLIR]
Excuse me! Miss Elaina!

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
Check this spell out!
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Ah!

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
[FLIR]
It's so cold!

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I wouldn't consider
myself a teacher, per se.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.752 position:50% align:center
Especially to kids
close to my own age.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
But when it was
all said and done,

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:06.216 position:50% align:center
I found that I actually
enjoyed the experience.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chatter]

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
[FLIR laughs]

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
[FLIR]
Huh?

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] This is my favorite
spot in the entire city.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It's something
I wanted to show you

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
before you left to
resume your travels.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
I simply adore this view.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I can see why. It's lovely.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] You're still leaving
tomorrow morning, right?

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes. On to the next country!

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
That's too bad.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
Not surprisingly,
it seems my students

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
have taken quite
a liking to you.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'll be sad.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Aw. I guess it is unusual

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
to see such a young witch.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It is. I wish you
could stay a bit longer.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
You know, I've been wondering.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
What will the students at the
academy do once they graduate?

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
Go to find work,
I would imagine.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
They go to work?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:28.882 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
Perhaps they could
deliver packages.

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
Or fly people around. Who knows?

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Are the street
performers who use magic

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.933 position:50% align:center
also graduates of the academy?

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Are they getting paid
for their work?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't know how much
they get paid, per se,

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.482 position:50% align:center
but yes, they do get paid.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.693 position:50% align:center
Still though, they're not off
showcasing their magic everyday

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
simply because they
want some money.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
Then what is their reason?

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
It's what they like to do.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
Think about yourself--

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
you travel because
you like it, right?

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
And it's the same
for these people.

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
They use their magic like this

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:08.672 position:50% align:center
because they love to
make other people happy.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I often thought about

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
what a wonderful
country this was.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
The beautiful streets,
the smiling people.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
The sight of them moved me.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.232 position:50% align:center
Royal Celesteria called
to me, perhaps because,

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
in its own way, it
reflected many of the joys

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
I'd experienced on
my journey so far.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] So, Elaina, what are
some other things you like?

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Uh... You mean,
besides traveling?

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
That's a tough one.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
Then you'll have to think hard.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Mm... Well, books are nice.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
Oh, anything else?

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Are you going to
tell me why you're asking?

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
No reason.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know. You're going to
give me a parting gift, right?

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
Yes. Maybe.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
Uh. That's sweet,

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
but I really don't think
it's all that necessary.

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
That's for me to decide.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
So, would you say
that you like flowers?

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a leading
question to me.

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Perhaps. Do you? Oh.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you prefer
butterflies instead?

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
You're the one who likes
butterflies, Miss Fran.

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.656 position:50% align:center
Wait, you don't like
butterflies? Very odd.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Uh, they're okay.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.036 position:50% align:center
Butterflies are just okay.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
But flowers, though.
They're good?

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
You're not going
to give up, are you?

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
What's your answer?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
Sure. I like flowers.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
Excellent, I'm glad
we established that.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
Well, then, let's meet at
the gate tomorrow, shall we?

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
She's not here.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
Based on our conversation,

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
I was positive that Miss Fran
was going to show up

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
with a bouquet of
flowers or something.

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
Which would make me happy,

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
but I knew they
wouldn't last very long.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
If I saw the same flowers
in another country,

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
they would remind me of her.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
I would think of her and the
time I spent at the academy.

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.119 position:50% align:center
And I knew it'd make me sad.

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.081 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I decided to leave on my journey

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
without waiting for Miss Fran.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
At least that way, I wouldn't
have to worry about any flowers

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
or sad feelings to come.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Well, Miss Fran.
I'll see you around.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA gasps]

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
A flower?

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Elaina.

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
You were the one who chose
the life of a traveler,

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:44.494 position:50% align:center
so of course, I would never
dream of trying to stop you.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
But I can do this much for you.
I hope you enjoy it.

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.962 position:50% align:center
Just, tell me. Do they
make you happy?

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
Yes! Extremely!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I want you to know
that my students and I

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
are all cheering for you
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
Carry that knowledge
with you always.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Thanks, everyone!

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll never forget you!

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Miss Elaina!

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
Bye. We'd love for you
to come back and see us.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
I'll be patiently
waiting for you!

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.444 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we'll all be waiting.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
I know we'll
meet again someday.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
But until then,
take care, Elaina.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:24.701 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.083 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And there on the horizon,

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
a young witch soared
over the grasslands.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
A beautiful smile
gracing her features.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
She asked herself:

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
"What country will
I encounter next?

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.137 position:50% align:center
What sort of interesting
people will I meet?"

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case, her heart
was filled with hope.

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.434 position:50% align:center
Who is this beautiful traveler?

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.895 position:50% align:center
That's right. It's me!

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.911 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Isn't that
a little too extravagant?

00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:33.663 position:50% align:center
Even for a statue.

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:43.506 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It looks like the
next time I see Miss Fran,

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.010 position:50% align:center
I'll at least have a pretty
interesting story to tell her.
