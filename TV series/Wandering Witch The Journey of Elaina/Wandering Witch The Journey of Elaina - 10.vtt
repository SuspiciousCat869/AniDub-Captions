00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Wow, this thing
looks ancient.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
Do you know what it does?

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.478 position:50% align:center
No clue. Apparently,
we confiscated it

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
a long time ago as
a part of some case.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
So, what do you want me
to do with it, then?

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] Well, for starters,
you can head across the ocean

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.616 position:50% align:center
to the west and look for
a place called Qunorts,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
the Town of Freedom.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
Then you're gonna find their
United Magic Association

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
office and place this box
right into their loving arms.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Great.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.627 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] You make one
delivery and get paid.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
What an easy job, right?

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.799 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds too easy.
I mean, if it's so simple,

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
why are you giving it to me
instead of doing it yourself?

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
Because I'm way too busy
getting ready for my vacation.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Vacation?

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
It's time I take a break
from all my hard work.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
U-Uh...

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
I don't care how
tempting it looks;

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
do not open that box.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
No telling what kind
of evil lurks inside.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
Aye-aye, sir!

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.071 position:50% align:center
No boxes will be opened here!

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
And I'm off! Bye!

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.286 position:50% align:center
We have fun. All right.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
I guess I better get going, too.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.305 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] Of course
you're working at the most

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.640 position:50% align:center
pretentious place
that you could find.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
Can you believe it's
been a whole year?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
My, my, how time does fly.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:09.939 position:50% align:center
They say time and tide
wait for no one, right?

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
Yes, O ancient one.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
Anyway, are you ready
to get out of here yet?

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
I mean, can we ya
know, leave? Or not?

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
Could you please
give me just a moment?

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
I'll be ready soon.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.122 position:50% align:center
So, Miss Fran,

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
are you off on urgent
business somewhere?

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
Well, no, it's vacation.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
--[ALL gasp]
--[STAR] Vacation?

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
You kids be good, now.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
Don't slack off on
your magic exercises!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Really? You took
on an apprentice?

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and her name is Saya.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
And apparently, she knows
your apprentice as well.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Saya? Oh, yes, I think
I remember her now.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.577 position:50% align:center
The girl Elaina helped
become an apprentice witch.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
It's such a small
world, isn't it?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
It certainly is. I've
met your Elaina, too.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Have you now?

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
Saya was so jealous
when I told her.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
She was ready to give up
on life right then and there.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
[FRAN chuckles]

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It's strange when
you think about it.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.181 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
What is?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
The two of us.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
I never imagined we would
end up vacationing together

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
every year like this.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
It is odd.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
I didn't even like
you at first, Fran!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
I didn't like you, either,
and here we are.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] This is the story
of an unlikely friendship.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
It begins when I was
still an apprentice witch

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
traveling the world
with my teacher.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Wha...? I'm so
sorry, I missed it.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
What did you say, ma'am?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
I was saying,

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
I may want to train
another apprentice.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] But... you have
an apprentice. Me.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
Sure, but I could always
use another one.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I think you should make
that decision on your own.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
I probably won't be much help.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] But, you would be
upset if I made this decision

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
without asking your
opinion first, right?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you're
looking at options?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
Or do you already know
exactly who you want?

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
Bingo.

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
You don't have to worry, Fran.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
What makes you say that?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
She's a good girl,
and I'm confident

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
you two will get
along beautifully.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
[FRAN sighs]

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Well, it's about time!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
A bit tardy, aren't we, Teach?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
That's not a very good example
to set for me, y'know?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
I apologize for the wait.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
It took a little
longer than expected

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.100 position:50% align:center
to convince my apprentice.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I do wish you'd refrain
from telling lies like that.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
Huh. She's supposed to be
my senior apprentice?

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
You just picked the weakest
girl you could find?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.071 position:50% align:center
[FRAN growls]

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
What? What're you staring at?

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
You're either starting a fight,
or you're obsessed with me.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I'm sorry, ma'am,
did you say she was a good girl?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
She has done nothing but insult
and attack me since we got here.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.836 position:50% align:center
You wanna say that to my face?

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
[BOTH growl]

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
Now, now, girls.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
You should try and get along
since you're working together.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
Let's play nice.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I guess you're right.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Hmph.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.
What's your name?

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
That's for me to know
and for you to cry about.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
[FRAN growls]

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER chuckles] Sheila, this
is Fran. Fran, this is Sheila.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
Try your best to get along.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
[FRAN coughs]

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It won't work.
She can't be kind.

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER giggles]

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] And so, after that brief
introduction, my teacher and I

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.091 position:50% align:center
began our journey with
Sheila, one I was sure

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
would end in disaster.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
The two of us were
like oil and water,

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
fundamentally incompatible.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.644 position:50% align:center
What do you girls think
we should have for dinner?

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
Fish? Or beef, perhaps?

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
Fish sounds good to me.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
You mean beef, don't you?

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
No.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] What? You're dying
to fight me, aren't you?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
Is fighting the only thing
you can talk about?

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
You sound so stupid.
Like seriously stupid.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
Talk about irony.
Can you hear yourself?

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.582 position:50% align:center
Aren't you a little old to have
such a limited vocabulary? Hm?

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's meet in the
middle and just have bread.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.961 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.590 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] I'll give you a
choice. Fire or ice magic?

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
Which would you like
to learn today?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Definitely ice magic.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
What? Don't listen to her.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
Fire magic, obviously!

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
Right, then how about
we meet in the middle

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
and just take a little nap?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.027 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Let's say your opponent

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
manages to take your wand away.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
How do you think you
should get it back?

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
With martial arts!

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:11.991 position:50% align:center
No way? Is that what
we're doing today?

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] I think using a bow
would be faster and cleaner.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA, FRAN growling]

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
Right, so on second thought,

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
perhaps we should
meet in the middle

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
and just learn
how to use knives.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
But why knives?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
You keep them concealed
in your clothing...

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
...until it's time to draw them.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
When you do, try to make
it look a little bit sexy.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] You're the only person
I've ever met that I could never

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
see myself being friends with.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Well, isn't that a coincidence?

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Sheila and I traveled
together for many months.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
Along the way, we took a job for
the United Magic Association.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:04.753 position:50% align:center
It was located in Qunorts, also
known as "the Town of Freedom."

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
"No mages allowed!"

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.050 position:50% align:center
"Mages feed on your fear."

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
"Mages are children
of the devil."

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
What the heck is that about?

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
Are they tryna pick
a fight with us or what?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It appears that those of
us who use magic in our lives

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
are not welcome in this country.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't go that far.

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
[FRAN, SHEILA]
Huh?

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.566 position:50% align:center
Perhaps not everyone
thinks this way.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't let a handful
of posters make us assume

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
the worst of an entire country

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
If we do, then we are no
different than whomever

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
put up these signs condemning
everyone who uses magic.

[OFFICIAL 10A]
Welcome, Madam Witch.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.834 position:50% align:center
We have been anxiously
waiting for you!

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
I'll cut to the chase:
this job is a doozy

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
and will be
extremely challenging--

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
How much did you
say that it pays?

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL 10A]
Uh...

00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:54.135 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be better to go over

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
what the job entails before
we discuss our terms, though?

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
What does it pay?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
Uh... Ha... We're offering
ten gold coins, Madam Witch.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Wow.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
She looks really
happy with that.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
All right, tell me
about the job.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
There's a new criminal group

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
calling themselves
The Curio Company.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
They're terrorizing our town

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
behind the scenes.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center

Ooh. The Curio Company.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL 10A] I'm sure you've
seen the posters and signs

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
that are hanging
all around town.

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
You know, the ones with
multiple threats defaming mages?

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
We have.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL 10A] The Curio Company
is a band of robbers

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.800 position:50% align:center
made up of people
who can't use magic.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
Because they have
no magic, they despise

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
those who do, especially
when they get in the way

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
of the group's
criminal activities.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.518 position:50% align:center
As a result, they make
it their mission

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
to harass and intimidate mages.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
Great, I don't
understand why you don't

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
just catch them
and put them away.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
You're all mages,
aren't you? Piece of cake.

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] It just seems a little
extreme to pay travelers

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
when you're perfectly capable
of taking care of your own town.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
And I don't disagree
with you, but...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.624 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you could
elaborate a bit?

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
Right. Well, you see,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
this company--they have tools
that we don't understand.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
Can you try to
explain them to us?

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL 10A]
Yes, of course.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
Let's see, there's
a sword that can cut

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
an unlimited number of
times without dulling.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
and guns that shoot hundreds
of bullets without reloading.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
And matches that project
visions of mythical beasts.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
These mysterious objects
seem to intensify

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
the user's natural talents,
making them as powerful as--

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
or more powerful than--
an actual mage.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
Tools like that really exist?

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL 10A]
Yes. And this group

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
can use them very skillfully.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
They lead mages around
by their noses

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
and then escape without
a trace every time.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Nobody in town
trusts mages anymore.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center

completely useless. Ugh...

Yep, I want you ladies to catch
the Curio Company together.

Sure, maybe they do have
some annoying weapons,

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center

I'm pretty sure you and I
had the same idea.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:36.923 position:50% align:center
We both planned on
being the one to catch

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
the Curio Company
and get the other girl

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
expelled in the process.

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center

have a few questio--

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] Hey. Not so fast.
I saw this loser first.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.421 position:50% align:center
So the little punkin'
belongs to me.

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
That's surprising
considering I cornered him.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's cute.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
What you don't know
is that I just used you

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.886 position:50% align:center
to catch him for me.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
And that gives me a better
claim to him than you.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
Ya get it now?

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
No, and even if I did,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
I still wouldn't
hand him over to you.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center

Now look at what you've done.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
It's like you're trying
to ruin everything.

If anyone around
here is useless,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
it would definitely be you.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
You mages have always been
a real pain in the rearend.

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
The worst part about
you lot is how you guys

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
insist on meddlin' in our work.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Thanks to your big noses,
we keep failin' at our jobs!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.189 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
how aggravating that is?

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
I, for one, am sick and tired
of your shenanigans.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
And as for you guys!

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
I can't believe y'all got bested

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.989 position:50% align:center
by a couple of
apprentice witches!

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
We worked so hard to make
people think mages are useless,

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:34.661 position:50% align:center
and now you've gone
and made people

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
start trustin' 'em again.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
Or maybe y'all don't care
about wastin' our hard work.

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
You don't get to call yourselves
a part of the Curio Company!

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center

heads in the game!

Right!

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center

could hear everything

the two of you witches were
talkin' about earlier, don't ya?

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
Stupid brats.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
Is getting' in our way just
playtime for you people or what?

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's what
you call playtime?

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center

has been so boring.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center

You got yourself caught
on purpose, too?

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
[MEN groan]

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
Yep. I figured I would just

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
sneak in and round
them all up at once.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
That's rather reckless.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
You're one to talk!

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Yes, well.

[FANG laughs] I was just kiddin'
about killing ya, okay?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
So how's about we
work out a deal?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
[FRAN, SHEILA sigh]

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.787 position:50% align:center
Let's take a quick breather
before we contact our teacher.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
Sounds good to me.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
You never mentioned it.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
But what exactly made you
want to study magic

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:34.299 position:50% align:center
in the first place?

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Oh, that story? It's not
all that interesting.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] I sort of
learned magic on my own.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
Hey! No!

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] Yeah, it was petty,
but it kept me alive.

00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
Then one day, the person I
tried to steal from was Teach.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.488 position:50% align:center
Catching me was easy for her.

00:19:56.571 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
It's weird, but up
until that point,

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
I didn't even know
witches existed.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.497 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] So you'd never
even heard of them?

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA]
Nope, 'cause no one told me.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
But Teach explained everything.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
She told me how
strong witches are,

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
and how much people
respected them.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
I thought about it,
and living as a witch

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
seemed preferable to living
life like a stray cat.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
That's why I asked her
to make me her apprentice.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
See? I told you it
wasn't that interesting.

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
Well? It's your turn.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I think my reason

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
may be even less
interesting than yours.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
The country that I come from
doesn't have any witches.

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
So, if I become a real witch,

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
then I'll be the only one
in the entire country.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Which means that I
would always have a way

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
to make a good living.
There you go.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
So basically, you're only
becoming a witch

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
for your own self-interest?

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Yes. Pretty much.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
Huh. Great. That's
the same reason as me.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] After that, Sheila
and I finished rounding up

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
the members of Curio Company.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
I will get you brats back for
this, just you wait and see!

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Won't they just
try something else

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
once they get out of prison?

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER] Probably.
But what really matters

00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
is that the two of you
did an excellent job.

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Sheila and I
continued to travel together

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.253 position:50% align:center
with our teacher.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
And when we returned
to her home country...

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center
Finally, we're witches!

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, ma'am!

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
They look good on you two.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:51.061 position:50% align:center
Congratulations. You're
both officially witches.

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
--[SHEILA] Thanks, Teach!
--[FRAN] Thank you!

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
One more thing.

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
As for your witch
titles... Uh...

00:21:57.609 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
Seeing as Fran's hair is black,

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:02.947 position:50% align:center
I'll dub her the
"Stardust Witch."

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.325 position:50% align:center
And because Sheila's
hair is so bright,

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
I give her the title
of the "Night Witch." 

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't it be switched?

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
Since my hair is
dark like nighttime?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and if my hair's shiny,

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
shouldn't I be
the Stardust Witch?

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:18.546 position:50% align:center
They're so different,
night and stardust,

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.216 position:50% align:center
but they compliment
each other well, don't they?

00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I'm not following.

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:29.808 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Hey!

00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:31.393 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second,
I think I understand

00:22:31.476 --> 00:22:33.061 position:50% align:center
your attempt at
a metaphor, Teach!

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.689 position:50% align:center
It's like, even if two people
are completely different,

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:38.775 position:50% align:center
they can still share a
connection or whatever, right?

00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:44.989 position:50% align:center
It looks like you
got the right answer.

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:46.241 position:50% align:center
One thing, though.

00:22:46.324 --> 00:22:49.077 position:50% align:center
Why choose our titles
based on our hair color?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.287 position:50% align:center
Because it just seemed cool.

00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:54.416 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] And so, our journey
with our teacher ended.

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:57.210 position:50% align:center
I returned to my homeland
and became a teacher,

00:22:57.293 --> 00:22:59.963 position:50% align:center
and much to my surprise,
Sheila actually went on to work

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
for the United
Magic Association.

00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:05.218 position:50% align:center
You've changed since
those days, haven't you?

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.429 position:50% align:center
Not really. Anyway...

00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:09.347 position:50% align:center
I like our relationship
better now.

00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.600 position:50% align:center
You're fun when you're not
being so dramatic, ya know?

00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50% align:center
Just as I thought,
you really have changed.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.813 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's called
growing up, genius,

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:18.440 position:50% align:center
and you did it, too.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:20.233 position:50% align:center
Now hurry up, we're
burning daylight, here.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:21.401 position:50% align:center
Enough small talk.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:22.610 position:50% align:center
[FRAN]
Right.

00:23:22.694 --> 00:23:23.862 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:29.409 position:50% align:center
Hold on, that box.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:32.203 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
Change of plans!

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:35.040 position:50% align:center
Sheila? Where are you going?

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:37.625 position:50% align:center
[SHEILA] No time to explain!
Just c'mon, Franny!

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:40.795 position:50% align:center
[FRAN] Here we go, I guess
some things don't change.

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:42.213 position:50% align:center
Wait for me!

00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.720 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
That day,

00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:51.639 position:50% align:center
I was headed towards
a very particular town.

00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:55.101 position:50% align:center
In volume four of my favorite
book, <i>The Adventures of Niké</i> ,

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.645 position:50% align:center
her two apprentices,
Foula and Shiren,

00:23:57.729 --> 00:24:00.023 position:50% align:center
