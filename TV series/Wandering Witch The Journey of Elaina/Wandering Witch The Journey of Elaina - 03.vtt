Close one.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should've flown over
the forest instead of through.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
Too late for that.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to keep going
and hope for the best.

[ELAINA] Some say that just
as the rose is protected

[ELAINA] And speaking of lovely
things, who is this beauty

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
soaring through the sky,
blossoming as brightly

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
as the most colorful
field of flowers?

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
That's right, it's me.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've seen
a field this exquisite before.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello there.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
Are you the one in charge
of tending to these flowers?

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
I don't know that anyone's
actually responsible for them.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
I just come here because I enjoy
being around them so much.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
I love to smell the flowers
while basking in the sunshine.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
It's amazing how many
different kinds there are,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
especially if nobody's
cultivating them.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
I can see why you like it here.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
Your lovely brooch means
you're a witch, am I right?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.950 position:50% align:center
If so, may I ask
for a favor of you?

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50% align:center
Of course. I'll do
whatever I can.

mind taking this bouquet

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
I don't mind
delivering it for you,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.881 position:50% align:center
but who am I supposed
to give it to?

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Anyone you want.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
What's important is
that someone sees

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
how beautiful these flowers are.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
I believe I understand.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
You want me to advertise
this flower field for you?

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50% align:center

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center

Hey! Stop!

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center

It's none of your concern,

It didn't bother me.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
Not much, anyway.

Why? What do you mean?

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center

Those flowers are poisonous.

Poisonous? But how?
Nothing happened to me.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 03B] Of course
not, you're a witch.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center

lose their minds.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
And you're certain it's
because of these flowers?

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 03B]
Oh, yes.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center

almost seduced, and

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
They head to where they bloom,

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
and then themselves become
nutrients for the plants.

I see.

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center

[CROWD chattering]

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
Those flowers.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] There are many
fascinating stories

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
in <i>The Adventures of Nik√©</i> .

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
That field of poisonous
flowers reminded me

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
of one about a strange plant.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Normally, plants
release magic for us

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
after absorbing sunlight.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
But, in that story, a sudden
mutation caused the plant

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
to start sucking magic
from those around it.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
It became sentient

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.792 position:50% align:center
and started behaving
violently toward people.

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
Could it be?

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] The following day,
before making my way

toward the next country,

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
I decided to return
to the flower field.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
There was something
I wanted to check.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
You're the guard
from the gate, right?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
Hi. Thank you for yesterday.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
I heard about your sister.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
I finally found her.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I ever would
have if you hadn't brought

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
that bouquet and her shawl.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
That's how I knew she was here.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50% align:center
Finally. I finally found her.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:46.466 position:50% align:center
[gasping] You've
become so beautiful.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
It's not fair to keep

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.686 position:50% align:center

Besides, I wanna show you off

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
now that you've become
as gorgeous as a flower.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
Would that be okay?

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center

Hey, do you mind

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
Hi! You came!

Good afternoon.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
To you, too!

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! You're a real witch!

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
Well then, what
brings you out here?

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveler. This is
a stop on my journey.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
And you?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
I'm out here on
a quest for happiness!

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
I see. What's that?

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:47.379 position:50% align:center
[EMIL giggles] It's a bottle
I use to capture happiness.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
But how do you capture it?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
When I see people, or even
animals feeling joyful,

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
I turn that joy into magic,

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
and then I store
it all in this bottle!

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
So that means you're trained
in the art of using magic, too.

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
And you're converting feelings

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
into something
that can be stored.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's more or less it.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
May I look inside?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
Uh-- No way!

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
If you were to open
it up right here,

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
then all of my hard work
would slip right out!

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
I've been gathering
these precious treasures

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
for a very long time to
give them to a girl I like!

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
What? Is that bad?

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.789 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] No. I'm a bit
moved by your words.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
It reminded me of a book
I read in the past.

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.546 position:50% align:center
Yes. For the sake of his wife

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
who was sick and homebound,

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.176 position:50% align:center
around the world,
documenting beautiful views

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
with magic, so that
he can bring them home

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
for his wife to experience.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
Whoa. What a great idea!

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Did his wife enjoy it as
much as he hoped she would?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
I, um... I can't
remember the end.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
[EMIL] I bet she healed and
lived a long, healthy life!

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's what happened.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
So, tell me a little bit
about this girl you like.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.491 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, she's
a servant named Nino

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
who does housework
for my family.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
But everyday when I see her,
she looks a little unhappy,

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.330 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to cheer her up!

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
I think there's enough
in here to make her smile!

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Least, I hope.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
Yes, let's hope.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] So you were testing
the feelings of plants?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.508 position:50% align:center
Yep! I wanted to see

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:19.054 position:50% align:center
if I could get any happiness
out of them, but I failed.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Well, lucky that the plants
didn't try to eat you.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
--[EMIL] Huh?
--[ELAINA] Oh, it's nothing.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Look! You can see it up ahead!

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
What a beautiful little village!

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.909 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I take it that's
the village chief's house?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
You could say
it's my house, too.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
Ah...

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
I expected a bigger
reaction than that.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:54.172 position:50% align:center
Sorry, did you want me
to act more impressed?

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! You're rich,
how amazing!

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
Uh. On second
thought, it's fine.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.515 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] So, when are you going
to give Nino the bottle?

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
Uh-- I was planning on doing it
right after we all eat lunch!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, I know!
Why don't you join us, too?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
Trust me when I say that Nino's
cooking is the best in town!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
I certainly appreciate the
invitation, but I actually

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
just had some breakfast
not that long ago.

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.448 position:50% align:center
[EMIL] We'll just make you
a small plate, then.

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
Are there any foods you
don't like or can't eat?

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
I don't care much
for mushrooms.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.539 position:50% align:center
Okay then, I'll be
sure to let her know.

00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And please make
sure it's a small portion.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
No problem!

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
We'll make you
something delicious!

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
Well, Nino will.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Welcome, make yourself at home.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
Um. Oh, hello, miss.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Yes, hello.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
If I may ask, could you be
from a land in the far east?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
Who? Me?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sorry, it's just,

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
you remind me
of someone I know.

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
How'd you guess?

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
It's true: as it
just so happens,

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
my father found her in
a land towards the east.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
Found her? I see.
And now you're here.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
I'm quite fortunate, because the
village chief is so kind to me.

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
I haven't actually
had the pleasure

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
of meeting the village
chief as of yet.

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's because he's busy.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Nino!

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
What're we having
for lunch today?

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.858 position:50% align:center
[NINO] Sorry. The village
chief requested fish.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.903 position:50% align:center
So, grilled fish
with a little salt.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
Since we have a guest,

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
can you whip up
an extra portion?

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[NINO]
Mm-hm.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
You'll stay, right?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Yes, and
thanks for having me.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
I only need a small
amount of food, though.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
Yes. Of course.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.831 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Hold on a second, Nino!

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
After we're finished with lunch,
I'd like to give you a present!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait. A present for me?

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
Yep! You're going to love it!

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
Please! That's really
not necessary!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.761 position:50% align:center
And it might make the village
chief very angry with me!

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry!

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
Everything will be just fine
as long as I talk to Father.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
But... I'm afraid.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
[EMIL] Fine, then I'll
make it a direct order!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.815 position:50% align:center
You will accept my
present, understood?

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
That way it's my fault.

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
In that case...

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Yay!

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
I can help you
with preparing lunch.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.159 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous,
Miss Witch, you're our guest!

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
We'll handle the food.

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
What's this?

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
It's not often we have guests.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.297 position:50% align:center
Hello there, are you
the village chief?

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
Indeed.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveling witch.
My name is Elaina.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
My, my, what a
polite young lady.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.437 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
Please, make yourself at home.

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER grunts]

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
Hm.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
Food's ready!

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
Um, sorry for the wait.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
Uh... This is small?

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
Is there a problem?

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:42.359 position:50% align:center
No. Nothing at all.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for the meal.

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
All right, let's eat!

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Thank you for lunch.
Everything was delicious.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:59.376 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh. That's
good. I'm glad.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
Please allow me
to clear the table.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center
I'll help you.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
No! We got it!

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
So, you met Nino
in a land to the east?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
Mm. I purchased her.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Purchased?

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
Yes, she's a slave.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
You see, my wife left us
a few years back.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
As such, we struggled
with the housework a bit.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
I was visiting an
eastern land for work

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.916 position:50% align:center
around the time,
and then I found her.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
She was expensive, but
quite good at housework.

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.255 position:50% align:center
And I imagine that,
as she grows older,

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
Nino will turn into
a beautiful woman.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Purchasing her was
an easy decision,

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
and she's turned into
such a wonderful servant.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
And does Emil know that
you actually purchased Nino?

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
Yes, he knows the story,

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
but Emil has never
been the sort of boy

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
to care about whether a
person is a slave or not.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
Hey, Nino! Where should
I put the big plate?

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.415 position:50% align:center
Why can't you just watch
what you're doing, wench?!

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
You really are worthless!

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
How stupid do you have to be
to screw up something so simple.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
Hurry and clean it up, or else!

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
[NINO] I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
[EMIL'S FATHER]
Quit groveling!

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
Hey, stop yelling!

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who scared her!
So, it's my fault!

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
You stay out of this, Emil!

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
I said clean!

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
[NINO]
Yes, sir!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] There's no reason
for you to clean it up.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
There, next time
be more careful

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
not to drop it, okay?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! Thank you so much!

00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry you had to see
our disgraceful behavior,

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
but I appreciate you
fixing our porcelain!

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
Go on. Don't you want
to thank our guest?

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
Um. I'm terribly sorry.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
You don't need to apologize,
just say "thank you."

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Miss Witch.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Of course!

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
[EMIL] I could have
fixed the china, too.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
With magic.

00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:47.502 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry,

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize my
help was unwelcome.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
No, I am grateful.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
It was my pleasure.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
Still. I know I could
have done it, too.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] You know,
now that I think about it,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
I bet Nino is feeling
pretty down right about now.

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
If only you had something
that could make her happy...

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
That's a great idea, Miss Witch,
you might be a genius!

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Agreed, but feel
free to praise me even more.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
Remember earlier,

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
when I said that I had
a present for you?

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
Um. Yes?

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Well... Prepare to be amazed!

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
It's a bottle filled
with happiness.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
That's happiness?

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:39.220 position:50% align:center
Yes, I used my magic
to capture the happiness

00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
of various people I found.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
Other people's
happiness? Using magic?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
You'll only get to see it once,
so look carefully, okay?

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
Right, are you ready? Let's go!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
All of these are little
pieces of happiness!

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
I did this for you.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
So you can see all the joy
in the outside world!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
Please, Nino. Don't look so sad.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
I promise that
I'll make you happy!

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
Me, happy? That's possible?

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[NINO sobbing]

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
I hope you'll visit again.

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
And when you come
back, Nino and I

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
are going to make you a meal
that's even more delicious

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
than today's was. Right?

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
Yes. That sounds lovely. Bye.

00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
[EMIL]
Take care!

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
The sky is so
beautiful this evening.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
It was then that I remembered

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
the ending of the story.

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:41.301 position:50% align:center
The one I'd told Emil
about when we met.

00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.303 position:50% align:center
The husband brought
the gorgeous scenery

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
back home to his wife.

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
But since she
couldn't go herself,

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:53.021 position:50% align:center
it ended up only
deepening her depression.

00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
Until one day...

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
"Beware seemingly
selfless deeds,

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.653 position:50% align:center
lest you do more harm
than good in the end."

00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
That's how it ended.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
It was a rather preachy message.

00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.784 position:50% align:center
So I thought.

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.161 position:50% align:center
But now I realize that
kindness and beauty

00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
can oftentimes be
unintended weapons.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
I don't know what happened to
Nino after I left their village.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
Some things are better
left as mysteries.
