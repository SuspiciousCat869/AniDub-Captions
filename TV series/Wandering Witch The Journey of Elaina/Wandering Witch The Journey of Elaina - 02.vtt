00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Although there are
many mages living in our world,

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
not all of them have
the same abilities.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
The majority of our population
is made up of novices

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.398 position:50% align:center
who can only perform
simple magic.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
Next are the apprentices.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
And at the very top
are those who have evolved

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
into fully trained witches.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
You'll know the true witches
by the brooches they wear.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
And who is this beauty
with ashen hair

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
fluttering in the wind,
you might ask?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
She who shines so brightly
with talent and splendor

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
that even the sun is
squinting involuntarily?

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
That's right, it's me.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.320 position:50% align:center
[SENTRIES]
Good afternoon!

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.239 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Land of Mages.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
Please come in, madam witch.
Nice to see you.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
Do you not need proof
of identification?

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:45.623 position:50% align:center
[SENTRY 02B] No, Only mages
have the ability to find us.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
And I can see your brooch
from here, Madam Ashen Witch.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
That's all the proof I need.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
Very well, then. Thank you.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.302 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] As you may have
deduced from the name,

00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
only mages can enter
the Land of Mages.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
And since witches are the
highest-ranked of them all,

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
I've heard we are
especially respected here.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
A full-fledged witch can expect
to be envied and fawned over.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.191 position:50% align:center
Perhaps it's one of the reasons

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.818 position:50% align:center
I've been looking forward
to visiting this country.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Looks like flying
is the preferred

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
mode of transportation here.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It is a very
elegant city, indeed.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
First, I'll have to find
a place where I--

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
[SAYA screaming]

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA, SAYA grunt, yelp]

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 02A]
Huh?

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
What just happened?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
What's wrong with this girl?

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
Um, are you all right?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Uh--

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
Wha...? Where did I fall from?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
And what do I do now?

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
I'll never be able
to fix those roof tiles.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
Well, you could
at least apologize

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
for knocking me down.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so sorry!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
Please forgive my stupidity!

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm perfectly
fine, thank you.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.508 position:50% align:center
But what about you?

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
Heh! I guess I'm
doin' okay, too!

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
As you can see,
I'm fit as a fiddle!

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
Here, take this.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
Uh! You sure?

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
You need to go rest and
take some time to recover.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
I'll handle the
roof tiles for you.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Let me help. I insist!

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
--[SAYA] But--
--[ELAINA] I said, it's fine.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
Is that a time-reversing spell?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
All fixed.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Ah!

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Okay, now it's your turn.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Uh--

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
Wow! You made it stop bleeding!

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Just another day
in the life of a witch.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.381 position:50% align:center
Farewell!

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
No, you're leaving already?

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
Please be more careful.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
And always check
your surroundings

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
when flying a broomstick.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
Wait, please don't go yet!

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
You're sweet, Nameless Mage.
Take care of yourself, dear.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
All right. Now to find a place.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Oh, that looks like
a splendid place to stay.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.034 position:50% align:center
What should I do if
the owners insist on

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
not requiring a payment from me?

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:14.165 position:50% align:center
As if to say the joy of my
presence was a worthy exchange?

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
[DOORMAN 02A] I'm sorry,
but you need to leave.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we don't have
any room for you here.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Sorry, miss.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
But I am certain you can
find a much more suitable

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
place to stay at
a different location.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
What is that supposed to mean?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I just don't understand.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
So much for being fawned over.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
I've been turned away
at every place I've tried.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
How about over here?

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
There doesn't seem to be
any more hotels beyond this.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
It looks a bit run-down,

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
so maybe they won't
be as particular.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
I hope not.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
Hi, how can I help
you today, miss...?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
It's you! The witch!

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
You're back for revenge, right?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.148 position:50% align:center
I... I knew it!

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.650 position:50% align:center
I'm so, so sorry!
Please spare my life!

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
Torture me--I deserve it...

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[SAYA yelps] Now everything
below my shoulder

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
will melt off, right?
I'm so sorry!

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
Well, no.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
I was just looking for
somewhere to stay.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
Huh? I was gonna ask
if you needed a hotel.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
And now I don't have
to go and hunt you down.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.548 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Will you please enter
your name in the register?

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
I'm happy I got the chance
to make it up to you.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
For earlier, I mean.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.430 position:50% align:center
I do hope you enjoy your
stay here, Miss Elaina.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
How do you know my name?

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
I just read it.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
I see, of course.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
And my name's Saya,
if you need anything.

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
I mean it. I am
so grateful to you.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
That's very kind.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, maybe you
could shave a little extra

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
off the normal
witches' discount.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure! You got it!

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
Here's your key!

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
I'll take all your things
up to your room right now!

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Oh, no.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.958 position:50% align:center
My brooch. It's gone.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
But how? Where?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
It must've fallen off
a long time ago.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
That's why all
of the other places

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
not only didn't fawn over me,
they shoved me out the door

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
as quickly as they
possibly could.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50% align:center
[SAYA] Miss Elaina!
I don't see it up here, either!

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
We've looked all over town
and can't find it anywhere.

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I'm sorry, Miss Fran.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
I let that happen.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
How could I lose
something so important?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Uh. What are you
doing in my room?

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
I was waiting for you.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
I have a favor to ask.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn I locked
the door when I came in.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
But I have all the keys
since I work here.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
'Member?

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
That doesn't give you the right

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
to come into my room
without asking permission!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
I have a right
to privacy, you know!

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
You're such a meanie.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Well? What was
the favor you needed?

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:33.073 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Oh, right! I know it's a lot.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
And you don't have to.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
But is there any way
you could tutor me

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
and help me pass the
apprentice witch exams?

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.830 position:50% align:center
First of all,

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
every time you drop to
that pose, it confuses me.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.460 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Oh, it's just a traditional way

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
to bow in my country.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
It's called <i>dogeza</i> .

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.547 position:50% align:center
" <i>Dogeza</i> ," huh?

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
Well, it is quite an
interesting tradition.

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
However, I will admit that
it does at least feel sincere.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
All right, tell me
about your situation.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:01.976 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Where to start?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
I have a little sister.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
She's the cute one
in this picture!

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.776 position:50% align:center
We're originally from a
land far away to the east.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
We both came here
together in hopes

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.572 position:50% align:center
of becoming apprentice witches.

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
That's quite a journey.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
We were working here
to save money.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
Took the exam a bunch,
but I haven't been able to pass.

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.206 position:50% align:center
So, if you haven't
passed it yet,

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
that means the two of you
are still novices

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
after all this time?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.545 position:50% align:center
Speaking of your sister,
where is she right now?

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
Is she out today?

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
No, she actually
passed the last exam,

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
so she thought it was best
to head back home before me.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
I see, so you're a bit panicked

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
because your baby sister
is ahead of you.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.434 position:50% align:center
And you figured you'd ask the
first witch you met for help?

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Right? Am I getting
close at all?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.355 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
I mean, I suppose you
could say that, yeah.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to know
when the next exam will be?

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
It's in one week.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
Just one week?

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
Well, I can at least
teach you a few things

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
until I find my brooch.
Will that work?

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you so,
so, so, so much!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
I really mean it!

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
I'm eternally grateful to you
and I will worship you always...

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And that is the
oddly endearing story

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
of how I became Saya's teacher.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
"Teacher."

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
It has an unexpectedly
nice ring to it.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] There are a few
steps involved in becoming

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
an apprentice witch,
the first of which

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
is that one must
pass a written exam.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
As much as I hate to
admit it, the written exam

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
can easily be passed
with a night of cramming.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
The problem is the second
part, the magic portion.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
One must keep atop their broom

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
while using nonlethal attacks
against the other examinees.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
The last person in the air
is the one who will pass.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
That person then becomes
an apprentice witch.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
To be honest,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I won't ever have
to take that test again.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Let me be straight
with you, Saya.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.629 position:50% align:center
Judging from your
current abilities,

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
I would say you have
almost no chance of passing

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.466 position:50% align:center
the next round of magical exams.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:00.053 position:50% align:center
You could be a little
less straight with me!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Notice how
I said "almost" no chance.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
Meaning there is some chance.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, so you're
saying that it is possible?

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
First, we'll start with your
broom riding techniques.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
You'll need to be able to
maneuver yours as well,

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
if not better, than me.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Better than you sounds
like a pretty tall order.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
I thought that you
wanted to pass.

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.324 position:50% align:center
Either you learn to
do this properly,

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.575 position:50% align:center
or you'll be knocked
off your broom

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
as soon as the test starts.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
Next, we'll learn to turn.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
To do this, you want
to shift your weight,

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
then swing as nimbly
as possible.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Right!

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
So next, we'll discuss
how to break suddenly.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
After forcing the broom to
a stop with your whole body,

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
pretend you're kicking
the air and shoot back up.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.265 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Right!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] This is how
you break away in midair.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
Should you ever lose your broom
in the middle of flying,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
simply use your magic
to call it back to you.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Not to worry.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure no harm comes to
you, so just focus on your task.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Saya seemed to be
a fairly quick learner,

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
and it didn't take
her much time before

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
she was flipping and flying
through the air with ease.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
She's managed to impress me.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:29.142 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel proud
of how much she's progressed.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
Almost like a mother
teaching her baby to fly.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
She's learning
a little too quickly.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.694 position:50% align:center
What has she been doing
with her time up until now?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Great work
out there today, Saya.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry at all?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
I am. Let's eat!

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
It's delicious!

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
That makes me so happy!

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ew, are you kidding?

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
They're all mixed in the soup?

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, are you saying

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.009 position:50% align:center
that you don't care
for mushrooms?

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
No, I loathe them!

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
They grow on trees and
they're a form of fungus!

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.890 position:50% align:center
They are basically tiny,
gross trees, themselves!

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
And I am not the sort of person

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.394 position:50% align:center
who likes eating
tiny, gross trees!

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.812 position:50% align:center
Well then, I have news for you:

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
picky eaters cannot
become witches.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50% align:center
Look, if you really
want to become

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.568 position:50% align:center
an apprentice witch, then
you must have the ability

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
to endure eating
all kinds of food,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
even if it's not to
your particular taste.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Yes, quite.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
Furthermore,

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
you should eat mine, too,
as part of your training.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
[SAYA whimpers]

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
That's so unfair.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.389 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA giggles]

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Watch, I'm going
to use wind magic

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.438 position:50% align:center
to knock the fruit
out of that tree.

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Ah!

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.276 position:50% align:center
Now you give it a try.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
Right!

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.408 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
the exam, it's crucial

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
to know how to utilize
attack magic with precision.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.537 position:50% align:center
And just between you and me,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
using wind magic can be
a slightly underhanded way--

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
I mean, a "clever trick"
to pass the test.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.879 position:50% align:center
You can use wind magic
to shift the flow of air

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
around the other examinees,

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
changing how they
fly their brooms.

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.301 position:50% align:center
Surprisingly
effective, actually.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
That makes sense,
especially coming from you!

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
I'm not entirely sure
what you're implying, Saya.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
But give the wind
magic another try.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.525 position:50% align:center
To master it,

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
you have to learn
with your whole body.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
Um. What's that mean?

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Like this.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.991 position:50% align:center
Feel how gentle this is?

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
I'm definitely
feeling something.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
Now go ahead and try again.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right! Wind magic!

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
That was even worse.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Thus, Saya's training continued.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
I taught her as much as I could
and then used our breaks

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
to search around town for any
signs of my missing brooch.

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
I've looked everywhere,
but I can't find it.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
Well, now that you ask,

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
maybe I have seen
your brooch somewhere.

00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
Oh, where do you
think you saw it?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.199 position:50% align:center
I just knew a lovely lady
like yourself would help!

[WOMAN 02A]
You're so sweet, unfortunately,

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
it's hard to remember.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
If only there were some way
I could jog your memory.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 02A] You know, I think
it's coming back to me!

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
So, this is what I saw
happen the other day.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Come in.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to bother
you, Miss Elaina.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Is
something the matter?

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.148 position:50% align:center
I was hoping maybe I could
sleep in here with you.

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
There's not really much room.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess we are
kind of a cheap hotel.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
I think you misunderstood me.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
It's fine. If that's
what you really want.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you!

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I was thinking.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
You've improved
quite a lot lately.

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
At the rate you're going,

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.761 position:50% align:center
it doesn't seem like you'll need
my help for much longer.

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh! That's not
true, Miss Elaina!

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
You know first-hand how clumsy
I can be, and there are still

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
so many things about magic that
I'd like for you to teach me.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveler, Saya.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
And soon, it will be time
for me to leave this country.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
Until that time comes, you and
I can stay together, right?

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
I wanna learn.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
So, please teach me
everything you know.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
Until you find your brooch.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
You and I both know you're
asking too much of me.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
It's time to give it back, Saya.

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:08.380 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
You improved way too fast.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
At first, I thought it was
because I was good at teaching,

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
but that wasn't the case.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
You were able to ride a broom
properly from the start.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.436 position:50% align:center
You said yourself you
come from a faraway land.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
If you were really
that poor of a flyer,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
then how did you even get here?

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
So when the woman I spoke
to told me what she saw,

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
it all came together.
You planned this.

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
You can't treat
people like this.

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50% align:center
You can't tie someone down
using misguided methods.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50% align:center
I was really lonely.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
I know, but I'm
not a replacement

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
for your little sister.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
I know that.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
But...

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
I still wanted to be
together with someone.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
I just hated being
alone so much.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.459 position:50% align:center
I was scared.

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
And that's why I decided...

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
--[ELAINA] Stop.
--[SAYA] Ouchy!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
What the heck was that for?

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
Being lonely is not
a good excuse.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
When you are truly serious
about accomplishing something,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
you're always going
to be by yourself.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
Being alone is just
part of the process.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
This isn't the time for friends.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know how hard
it is to fight alone.

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
It is scary.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
I understand because
I've been there myself.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
So take this.

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Your hat?

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
No, it's your hat.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
Now you'll be fine
even if you're alone,

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
because with this hat,
you'll always have

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
a part of me that's
fighting by your side.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
But then you'll be hatless.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
Oh. Don't worry about me.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
That's actually a spare one.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
And this way,
you and I can match.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
After I leave here,
you'll be by yourself again.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
But, you'll never be alone.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
Because you have people
like me and your sister.

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:29.145 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
we'll be watching over you.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
I'll pay for your hotel stay.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Out of my own wages.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
If I don't have enough,
I'll pay in installments.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:52.836 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And so, we spent
our last night together.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
I comforted her as much
as I could and taught her ways

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.764 position:50% align:center
to make it through
the magic exams.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:07.100 position:50% align:center
She told me about
her little sister,

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
and I told her all about
my journey so far.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
Lying there, Saya looked
so fragile and helpless.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
But deep down,
she reminded me

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center
a lot of my past self.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.674 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Six months have
passed since that day.

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.385 position:50% align:center
I've continued my journey
and I'm now visiting a country

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
far from the Land of Mages.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:47.557 position:50% align:center
Oh, they released the
latest magic exam results.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] The article that I
read revisited a young girl's

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:55.190 position:50% align:center
days of anguish, but also all
of her hopes for the future.

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:56.858 position:50% align:center
It mentioned her sister,

00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
her run-in with a traveler,
how a hat gave her the courage

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
to keep fighting alone,

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
and finally become
an apprentice witch.

00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
It said...

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
[SAYA]
When I become a full witch,

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
I'm going to go see
the traveler that I love!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA chuckles]

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.710 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I'm waiting patiently for you.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
One day we will
meet again, Saya.
