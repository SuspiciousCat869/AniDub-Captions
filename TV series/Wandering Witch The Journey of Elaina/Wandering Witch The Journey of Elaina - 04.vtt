00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
This is a story about love.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
About a princess
who lost her heart.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
She fell in love
with the castle cook,

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
who some would say
was beneath her,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
though their respective classes
mattered little to them.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
Why do we describe it
that way: "falling in love"?

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
Is it because one tumbles into
it suddenly and unexpectedly,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
like a pitfall trap?

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't know.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] They nurtured their
love secretly, and in time,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
the princess became pregnant.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:49.424 position:50% align:center
Yes, it was the fruit of
their love, so to speak.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
The entire place is in ruins.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
I wonder if there was
a battle or something.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
Surely I would have
heard about it.

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
I can't see a single
living person anywhere.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
What am I going to do now?

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
Even if I left and
headed to another town,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
I won't arrive until the middle
of the night, but if I stay,

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
then I'll freeze
to death for sure.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It looks like there's
one building still standing.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
That's my best hope.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Hm?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess no one's home.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
This wasn't my first choice,

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:31.730 position:50% align:center
but I have to do what
I have to do. Forgive me.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Who are you?

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I feel alive again.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
I imagine it's quite
chilly out, isn't it?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
I must say, I was surprised
to find this place inhabited,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
given the state of the town.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
For my part, I was surprised
to find that I had a visitor.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I ask
where you came from?

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
A land far away from here.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
I'm a traveler making a journey,
and I've come a great distance.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
May I ask your name?

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's Elaina.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
And I'm Mirarose.
It's a pleasure.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
If I may ask.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
What was it that decimated
the entire town?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I don't know.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.937 position:50% align:center
It may sound absurd,
but it's true.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
I haven't a single memory
of what happened

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
or of how I survived it.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
I simply woke one day
in this castle,

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
surrounded by destruction.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
So, you're suffering
from amnesia?

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.326 position:50% align:center
It would seem so.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.204 position:50% align:center
And yet somehow you can
still remember your own name?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
"You have forgotten,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
but your name is
Princess Mirarose."

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
So, you're a princess, then.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
You are living in lavish
rooms inside a castle,

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
so I suppose it makes sense.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. "You're probably
wondering why you're here.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
What became of this land
and all its people.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Why it is you remember nothing.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
Allow me to explain
a little about your situation.

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
Heed these words
or you will die."

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
Well, they seem
pretty self-important.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
It looks like the sun has set.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
Um, it goes on to say:
"Before I tell you more,

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
I would like for you
to wait until nightfall

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
and then look
out the window."

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Out the window?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA gasps]
What is that?

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.200 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
The letter will tell you.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
"That monster is responsible

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
for this entire
kingdom's destruction,

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
and also for the loss
of your memory.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
Javalier is the beast's name."

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:43.213 position:50% align:center
So that's it? Javalier?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
The letter goes on to describe
it in further detail.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
"Awakening as the sun sets,
wreaking havoc

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
until it rises again,
Javalier's goal is to annihilate

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.684 position:50% align:center
every single inhabitant
of this land.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
It rages on, searching
for the last living soul.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
Searching for you."

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50% align:center
And so it seems Javalier
will not rest until I am dead.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
You risk your life
by staying here,

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
so why wouldn't you just run?

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
According to the letter,
Javalier cannot

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
enter the castle, and I'm safe
as long as I'm inside.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
It reads:

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
"Javalier seeks to slay
'she who has become a princess

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
without subjects.'
Running will do no good.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
The monster will chase until
you are caught and killed."

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
Finally, it says,
"I close this by asking

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.722 position:50% align:center
you to defeat Javalier.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
It should be a simple
enough task for a witch.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
Use your power to kill
the ruthless demon.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
End this once and for all.

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
If not for your own sake,
then for the sake of those

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
who have already
suffered and perished."

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center
And there you have it.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
Interesting, Mirarose.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
It seems that you're a witch.

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
And it seems, Elaina,
that you're one, too.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Yes, though I think that
should have been obvious

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning.
I am wearing my brooch.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.794 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
I'm just teasing.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
That letter leaves so many

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
important questions
unanswered, though.

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
Why did Javalier appear
in the first place?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
Why were you the only survivor?

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.058 position:50% align:center
How did you lose your memory?

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
There are a lot of blanks.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
You're right.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
But the path forward is clear.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
I was once a princess of the
kingdom destroyed by that beast,

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
therefore I have a solemn duty
to see it defeated for good.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] How many nights
has it been now

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
that you've looked
out and seen it?

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
This makes seven.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And have you fought it?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Not yet. But I will.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow night.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Do you have
any chance of winning?

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Of course I do.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
You seem quite confident.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
It's been one week
since I first awoke.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
At least I've remembered how
to use magic, if nothing else.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
I have a sneaking suspicion
that I was quite

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
an accomplished witch prior
to my sudden memory loss.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
I feel my magic's
been recharged.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Do your best.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
I'll be there cheering you on
from a safe distance.

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
You mean you don't
plan to help me?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.326 position:50% align:center
No, because I don't stand
to gain anything by helping you.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
You may not be altruistic,
but you are honest.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
I can respect that.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
That's good, thank you.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Mirarose allowed me
to stay the night,

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
showing me to a spare room
that had once been used

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
by one of the castle's servants.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
Now then.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
[giggles] This bed
is so soft and fluffy!

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
I haven't been this
comfortable in forever!

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sniffs]

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Something smells good.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
G'morning, Mirarose.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.062 position:50% align:center
Morning, the bread's
just finished baking.

00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? But who baked it?

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Me!

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
Wait, you know how to bake?

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
It appears so.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
But you're a princess.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
Yes, I suppose that
does sound strange.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
I don't know why, but
my body seems to remember

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
how to cook just fine.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's have breakfast
while it's still warm.

00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA gasps]

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Looks delicious!

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
So good.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear it.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
May we chat while
we eat breakfast?

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
I'd like to strategize
for tonight.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
You're going to try and
defeat Javalier, right?

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50% align:center
Yes, and I was hoping you
might help me to prepare.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Well, you gave me a warm bed

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
for the night and then fed me.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
Helping you prep
is the least I can do.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE] Then, I don't suppose
you'd help me fight him,

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
would you?

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
That one's still a no.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
Worth a try.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I don't understand.
If the palace is safe

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
like the letter said, then
don't you also have the choice

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
of not fighting?

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
That is, if you
believe the letter

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
to be completely credible.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
I don't believe the
letter to be fake.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
The resentment for Javalier
feels far too palpable.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
How strange. And why
do you think that is?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
I can feel it.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
The author's hate for Javalier.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
It's so authentic.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.892 position:50% align:center
I can't possibly doubt it.

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
And for some reason,
I share those feelings.

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Well?

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
Think you'll finish
by nightfall?

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but it all depends
on your definition of finish.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
As it stands now, you look to be
a little over half way done.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
Just half?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Mirarose's plan
was to trick Javalier

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
into chasing her
into a pitfall trap.

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Once in the hole, it would
be unable to escape

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
her relentless magical attacks.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
It's basic, but even if it just
prevents a counterattack,

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
it could still be
quite effective.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
The flaw in this plan
is that the preparations

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
are a huge pain.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
This is nothing!

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
For I am the
Ashen Witch, Elaina!

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
'Tis a trifle!

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Thank you for your help.

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
It's almost time.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
Let's meet up again later.

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.096 position:50% align:center
And I'll be sure to treat you
to a delicious dinner.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
It'll be a lot of effort
for you to cook after

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
finishing such an enormous task,
so I'll cook instead.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
Okay? So don't you dare die.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.902 position:50% align:center
Death's not part of the plan.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.079 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Now. You should go.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
Until later.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
Of course I had to come.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
It's strange.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
Even though I'd only
just met her yesterday,

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.993 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but feel like I
really wanted Mirarose to live.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
And that's why...

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
...I will fight if I have to.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
From a safe distance, of course.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
That's it! Follow me!

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.416 position:50% align:center
Come and get me, Javalier!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
It's coming.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
The plan actually worked!

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
Wow, she's really strong.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
Maybe she won't need
my help, after all.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, Mirarose!

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
And now I remember.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
That's amazing.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Well?

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:23.413 position:50% align:center
Do you finally understand?

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
All of my despair?

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Farewell...

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
...dear Father.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
I got my memories back.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
All of them!

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
See?!

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.780 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
I remember!

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Mirarose finally
confessed to the king,

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
her father, about how
she'd become pregnant

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
with the cook's child.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
Without hesitation, he decreed: 

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
"The servant will be executed."

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] No one could
appease the King's wrath,

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
and the cook was subjected
to cruel torture.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
He was burned to death
in front of her very eyes.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
He killed my child.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
It was that day I swore that
I would kill everything else.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
First, I had to make
the castle a safe place.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
I put up a barrier that would
only allow mages to enter.

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I see, and that's why Javalier

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.009 position:50% align:center
couldn't get into the castle.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
Right after that,

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
I left a letter for myself,
and then I cursed my father,

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
turning him into a monster.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
The spell was so powerful,
it would cost me my memories.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
It was your father.

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
He destroyed this entire
country and its people.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
That's right. He ate
his beloved subjects.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
And he did it while still
aware that he was the king.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
That monster ate the subjects
whether he wished to or not.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
That should have made him
understand how it felt.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
To have the things dear to you,

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
the things you love,
snatched away.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.549 position:50% align:center
Now he knows my pain.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE humming]

00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Okay, the bread's done baking,

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
who's ready for breakfast?

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE]
Dig in while it's still hot.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.121 position:50% align:center
Well then? Is it good?

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.458 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm so glad!

00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
It doesn't even come
close to comparing

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.712 position:50% align:center
to the bread you bake, though.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
Do you want some more?

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, look, you've got
jam on your cheek,

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.677 position:50% align:center
you're such a mess!

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.013 position:50% align:center
[MIRAROSE laughs]

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:31.476 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Her "love story" had
finally come to a close,

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:34.688 position:50% align:center
but with an ending that Mirarose
had personally devised.

00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:37.816 position:50% align:center
And by her own hand,
she became the princess

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:40.068 position:50% align:center
of a land without subjects.
