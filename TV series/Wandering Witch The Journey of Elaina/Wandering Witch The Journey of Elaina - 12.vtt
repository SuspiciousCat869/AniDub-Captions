[ELAINA]
This is where my story begins.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.654 position:50% align:center
The story of a witch
and a traveler.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
I am both, and my journey
is best described

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
as a series of
introductions and farewells.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
It's also a series of choices.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.249 position:50% align:center
I have made so many that
couldn't be reversed.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
And yet, they've made
me who I am today.

[ELAINA] "The Country That
Makes Your Wishes Come True"?

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I wish to be super rich.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.896 position:50% align:center
I wish to be super rich.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
I wish to be super rich.
Super rich...

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
Miss Fran's treehouse?

[ELAINA gasps]

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
This isn't even kind of
what I wished for.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.622 position:50% align:center
Wow, this is strange.
What's going on here?

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:22.267 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute. Is that
MirarosÃ©'s castle?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
Stop. Please don't move.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.535 position:50% align:center
I need to know which
version of me you are.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
A good me? Or an evil me?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.749 position:50% align:center
"An evil me"--what are
you talking about?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize there were
other versions of myself.

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
Oh! I like your glasses.
Were they expensive?

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.894 position:50% align:center
So who are you,
and why do you look--

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
I'm Elaina. The Ashen Witch.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.524 position:50% align:center
How is that possible?
<i>I'm</i> Elaina, the Ashen Witch.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.026 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course you are.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
I made a wish upon
entering this place,

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
but it had nothing to do
with creating another me.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.658 position:50% align:center
Well, we didn't want it, either.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
Who's "we"? There're more of us?

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
Exactly how many me's
are we talking about?

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't know
how many there are in total,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
but there are 15
of us here now.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
What? Are you serious?

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
[ELAINAS chattering]

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
May I have your attention?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
We have one more me.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to meet
the 16th Elaina.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA E]
Oh-ho!

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
I see you've decided to cosplay
me like everyone else!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I approve of doing
it without permission, though!

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.567 position:50% align:center
So... I'll just have to
charge you a tiny fee!

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
That'll be 10,000,000,000
in gold, please!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
She gets excited about money.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
So instead of the Ash witch,
we call her the "cash" witch.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Hello, Cash Witch.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
Party! Nice to meet ya!

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.414 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously]

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] And to my right,
we have the Dumb Me.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
Me Number 16, it's so
nice to meet you.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.549 position:50% align:center
Knock-knock, who's
there? Nobody!

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
I lived!

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
Seems more like a combination
of dumb and clumsy.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] This is the me
who loves all the girls.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it;
how did I get so lucky?

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
Wow, 16 of me?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Beautiful young ladies
as far as the eye can see!

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It's not so much
that she likes girls--

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
more that she loves herself.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.695 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
And then we have this one,

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
who has a real
preoccupation with her, um...

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
..."upper half."

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
Oh, honestly.

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
It's strange how so many
of you claim to be another me,

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
when compared to mine,
your little chests

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
look rather deflated
and pathetic.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you guys?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
Got something against
drinking milk, or what?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
No, my poor chest!
Come back to me!

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
D for effort.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
That one is the moody me.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA B]
Don't bounce away!

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Hey, what're you looking at,
you newbie-jerk?

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
You wanna fight me?
Come on, let's go!

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] Right next
to her is the Greedy Me.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.981 position:50% align:center
If I took all the money

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
from every one of the me's
here, I'd be super rich!

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] So far,
she's the most relatable.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
That one is the cringey me.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
There's a black dragon
trapped in my eye

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
and he's tryin' to attack you!

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
I suggest you all
stay away from me!

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
Get out, now!

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] We call this one
the love-struck maiden me.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
I love you so.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
Sweet Saya. Please be myan.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
It had to be Saya.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
This one's a bit disturbing.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
It's me trying to hide from the
darkness deep down in my heart.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
Just kill me now.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with the poor girl?

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] This is me with
darkness deep down

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
in my heart 2.0.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
This sucks. The world is scary.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
Must make being
a traveler difficult.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] And that's me with
darkness deep down in my heart

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
3.0.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
I can't take it.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
I wish all the me's in here
would just die already.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
A little unnerving how
many dark sides I have.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] I like to refer
to that one in the boots

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
as "foreign me."

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
<i>Da, Khorosho?</i>

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
Yes, quite a show!

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
This is the gelatinous me.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA J moans]

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
She's not even human.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A] This is the me
that turned into a ghoul.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
How'd that happen?

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center
I, of course,
am the intellectual me.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
You do think highly
of yourself, don't you?

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
Why, yes I do!

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
Oh. We've got to call
you something, too.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
You know, something a little
more specific than "Number 16."

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
Ladies? Any ideas?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
Do you see any traits
that stick out to you

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
that would help bestow a name?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
Nope!

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
--She's cosplay me!
--[ELAINA M] Zero personality.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
[ELAINAS chattering]

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:48.783 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA L]
Sweet Saya. Wherefore art thou?

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
--[ELAINA R2] I wanna die.
--[ELAINA F] Khorosho.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
I see, I see.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
You all have interesting points.
That was very helpful.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
In what way could that
have been at all helpful?

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
It was. Trust me.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
Based on all this information,

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
I would like to call
you Protagonist Me.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
I have no idea which
incoherent train of thought

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
led you to that completely
incomprehensible name.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
It was the one about you
having no real personality.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
I did my best to spin your
weakness into strength.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
I'm not especially
keen on you saying

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
I have no personality.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.899 position:50% align:center
You're just not looking
at it in the right light.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50% align:center
No personality means you're
like a blank slate.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
You can become
anything you want!

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
Like clay!

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Okay. Well, can anyone explain

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
why we're all
holed up in this place?

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
Because we're safe here.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
There's an evil me
in this country

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
mixed in with the rest of us.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
She's known to be
extremely violent,

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
attacking whenever
she meets another me.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
The danger is quite real.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA A]
She's so violent, in fact,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
that we decided to
call her "Violent Me."

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
You gave that a lot of thought.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
So basically we're stuck
in this place because of her?

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
We're hiding from the
so-called Violent Me.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
But violent or not,

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
she's still just
another version of me.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
So even if you did fight,
the very worst that could happen

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
is you come out of it
with a draw, right?

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
No, Protagonist Me,
think about it.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
If the opponent is also me,

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
that means I'd be
battling myself.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
So no matter how it turns out,
I would end up injured,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
whether I win or lose.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine
what would happen

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
if we did manage to kill her?
How would it affect all of us?

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can't answer that.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
And neither can we!

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA E]
Since we don't know what to do,

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
we shouldn't do anything!

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Except maybe sit around and
talk about what we won't do?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
Amiright? Yeah?

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
Please ignore that one.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know what
you think we should do.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I don't have any
suggestions to offer, either.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.185 position:50% align:center
You can't do that to us.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
You're the Protagonist
Me, remember?

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
This is your moment as the
protagonist to step forward

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.650 position:50% align:center
and take charge!

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
Along those same lines,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
my role is the adviser
to the protagonist.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
I see now, you wanted
everyone to call me

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.908 position:50% align:center
the Protagonist Me
so that you could use me

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
to solve the problem for you.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
I'm such a little
scammer. As expected.

00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Well, all right,
if that's how you feel...

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Will all the me's
other than me please go out

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:21.561 position:50% align:center
and search the town for clues
of Violent Me's whereabouts?

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50% align:center
I'll be waiting right here.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
I look forward to a detailed
report when you return.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
That's no fair! I know
what I'm trying to do!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50% align:center
The protagonist
should step down!

[ELAINAS chattering]

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
I really don't understand why

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
you're attacking me when you're
the ones who put me up

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
on this pedestal by proclaiming
me as the protagonist.

[ALL gasp]

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.925 position:50% align:center
No! How could we
let Ghoul Me die?

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
Disgusting!

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
At least it was
an instant death.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.429 position:50% align:center
Gel Me has been
crushed and appears

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.056 position:50% align:center

Ugh. They're alive. Damn it.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad everyone's okay.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
It's about time,
and you're all together

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
in one big room.
How considerate.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
That must be her. I mean, me.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
Yes, that is Violent Me.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
Hope I've enjoyed it here.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
'Cause this is the end
for every last one of me.

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA V] I take it that the
me perched so comfortably

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
on the throne over there
is the leader

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
of this little band of me's?

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
I don't know about all that,
as I've only just arrived,

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.725 position:50% align:center
but either way, I am
called Protagonist Me.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
In that case, I hope
you'll forgive my rudeness.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
In deference to the protagonist,

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
you'll die first!

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
Now hang on.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
Obviously I don't know
what happened to upset you

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
so terribly that you'd
want to attack me.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
But are you truly confident
that you can defeat 16 of us?

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm afraid
Gel Me and Ghoul Me

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
are out of commission,
so we're actually down to 14.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
Then are you truly confident
that you can defeat 14 of us?

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
Without a second thought.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
I'm not weak from the luxury
of a carefree existence

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
like you all seem to have.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
So you think we're weak?

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
You do realize we're all
the same person here?

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's time you
look in the mirror.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
Now I gotcha!

Maybe I can finally
get out of here.

Into the darkness.

Oh, so it was a trap.

And now I feel as though
we're awaiting our execution.

Get over here and
face me, you bastard!

Is the reason
you're not fighting

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
because you're scared?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
It was more important
to observe you.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA V]
To what end?

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.806 position:50% align:center
I was trying to decide
if defeating you in combat

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
was worth my time.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:48.018 position:50% align:center
My, somebody's impertinent.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center

Yes. Much like you, in fact.

If you don't mind,

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
I'd like to ask why your
hair is still so short.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if
you're being stupid

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
or willfully ignorant.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.158 position:50% align:center
You know why my
hair was cut off.

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
My hair was stolen from me
when I visited there as well.

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA V] I didn't have
the energy to put my hair

everything I'd been through.

I couldn't save a single person
in that stupid country.

I was completely
useless to them.

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
I want you to tell me
something, Elaina.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Have you ever witnessed
the instant love turns to hate

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.636 position:50% align:center
with your own eyes?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
Have you ever had to
sit by and watch someone

turn on a person they once
loved with murderous intent?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
I can't say that I have.

And what happened next?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
The Ripper, I assume.

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.498 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry you didn't
have an opportunity

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
to get your hair back.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
It sounds like your journey
has been pretty different

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
from the rest of ours.

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
You don't say.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Oh, yes, completely different.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
No question.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
It's as I thought.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.178 position:50% align:center
You must understand now that
we're hardly the same person.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
What's your point?

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
So you "witnessed the instant
love turns into hate,"

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50% align:center
and then what?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
You fell into deep despair?

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
Then you didn't even
have the energy

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
to get your hair back in order.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
Is that really all
it took to break you?

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA V gasps]

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
I certainly don't remember
wishing for anything

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
that should have put me right in
the middle of a mess like this.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
What I felt wasn't despair.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
It's pure, seething
anger and hatred.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
Oh? At what, if I may ask?

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
I think that should be obvious!
I'm angry with myself!

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
And all the other
versions of me.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Traveling about without
a care in the world,

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
while I was made to suffer.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
I experienced one
cruel reality and froze.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to find my way
back from being so worthless.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
So she's taking her anger
out on the rest of us.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center

I wish you would all
disappear already!

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you'll have
to be a little more specific.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
Is that directed at me?
Or are you speaking to yourself?

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
This country is supposed to make
your deepest wishes come true,

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:56.915 position:50% align:center
and I cannot forgive
the me's who exist

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
without having experienced
the agony that I have.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
That must be why I'm here!

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
So I can inflict every
other version of me

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
with the same pain I've endured.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
Even if that is your
deepest desire,

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
I can promise that won't
fulfill any of ours.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Why else, then?

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
What other reason could there be
for all of us to gather here?

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center
You haven't figured it out yet?

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Or are you faking
to justify your rage?

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:21.398 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] On we went,
slinging spells at each other

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
with full force.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
But unfortunately,
and predictably,

00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
we were too evenly matched.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
And in the end,

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
even after we'd both
exhausted all of our magic,

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:34.244 position:50% align:center
we had settled nothing at all.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
[ELAINAS panting]

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.337 position:50% align:center
What I was even thinking?

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
And what's the point of
this cursed country anyway?

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
I have an idea.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
So if you really
can't figure it out,

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to tell you what
I was kind of longing to find.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.142 position:50% align:center
As it turns out,

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
I needed these other me's
to help me understand myself

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
a little better. Because,
somewhere in my heart,

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
I was dying to see
all the other possibilities.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
Journeys are a series
of meetings and farewells.

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
By the same token, they're
also a series of choices.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
So think about this.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.831 position:50% align:center
If I had made any of
those choices differently,

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
I may have become a
different person entirely.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
I wanted to meet all the other
possible versions of us!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
That's great.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
But you do realize that
still doesn't explain

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
what I'm doing here.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
Sure it does, silly.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
We're the same person,
so I can guess how you feel.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
And I think you yearned for
the other us's like I did.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
But specifically for
a version of yourself

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
that wasn't caught up
in the middle of the sorrow

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
at the Clock Village of Rostolf.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] You can't change
what happened to you,

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
but I think you came here
to remind yourself

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
of what you were like
before all that pain.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
You see?

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.625 position:50% align:center
You didn't find us because
you were destined to hurt us.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
You needed help
healing yourself.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
Well, that's pretty
self-centered.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
Did you say it's
"self-centered"?

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
Of course it is,
there's no one here but you.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:17.597 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to hear it.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
I can tell you my version
of how I traveled back in time

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
with the Lavender Witch.

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
That's a big part of
why I came here, too.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And so,
I made peace with myself.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.247 position:50% align:center
And there we sat,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
talking until the sky grew dark.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] When we finally
arrived back at the castle,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
we shared our diaries
with one another.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
Trading stories of our
travels deep into the night.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.179 position:50% align:center
Hey, ladies.

00:18:58.263 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
I have an idea
I want to run by you.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
What kind of idea?

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
I was thinking...

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
We kept these diaries to tell
Mom about our travels, right?

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
But why not tell
the rest of the world?

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
What do you say we
turn them into a book?

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
A book?

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Kinda like
<i>The Adventures of NikÃ©</i> .

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
Although, with everything
we've already been through,

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.662 position:50% align:center
our story will become
something even greater.

00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
Yes, I think that's brilliant!

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
A proposal befitting
of Protagonist Me.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.293 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to be a book.

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:29.919 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, I'm totally in!

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
Chronicling our dark past?
Count me in.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
In that case,
I suppose we should

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
start brainstorming titles.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
Just like NikÃ©, huh?

I like <i>Let's Go, Elaina!</i>

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
What about

Can all the me's
take this seriously?

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] It took until
the wee hours of the night,

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:18.927 position:50% align:center
but after some
intense discussion,

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
we finally settled on a title.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:33.900 position:50% align:center
Where do you plan on going

00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
now that you aren't
out for revenge?

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
I think the first
order of business

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.406 position:50% align:center
will be to get all my hair back.

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.784 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess, it's probably
still on that creepy doll.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
That's a good plan.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.203 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Besides, the Ripper has
already been caught, so...

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
All I have to do is find the
doll and I should be good.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
And, hey.

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Elaina.

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:56.923 position:50% align:center
You're very welcome, Elaina.
Don't mention it.

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
See you in the morning?

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
See you in the morning.

Crazy.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center

[ELAINA grunts]

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
All right. On to the next one!

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And now,
one last question for you.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
Who is this witch
soaring overhead,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.226 position:50% align:center
gracing humanity with her
charm, and so beautiful

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
that she'd steal your
breath more surely

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
than a swift flight
across the open plains?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
You know her well by now.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
She's traveling the world
and writing my--

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
no, <i>our</i> , story down on paper.

I'm so sorry!

00:22:58.003 --> 00:22:59.170 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
No, it's all right.

00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.047 position:50% align:center
I wasn't looking, either.

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:04.801 position:50% align:center
But, you know,
the world will pass you by

00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:06.761 position:50% align:center
if you always keep
your nose in a book.

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:08.680 position:50% align:center
It's important to
appreciate your surroundings,

00:23:08.763 --> 00:23:10.598 position:50% align:center
'cause that's how
you make memories.

00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:13.018 position:50% align:center
Of course. Sorry again.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:14.227 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:23:21.192 --> 00:23:23.945 position:50% align:center
Well, let's both be
more careful next time.

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:25.530 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right.

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:52.265 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Of course,
I didn't realize it at the time.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:55.060 position:50% align:center
But she and I were
destined to meet

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.645 position:50% align:center
and travel together
in the future.

00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:03.860 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Amnesia and I would
have a lot to talk about.
