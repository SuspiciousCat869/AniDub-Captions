[stomach growls]

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Who is this frail,
yet beautiful woman,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.207 position:50% align:center
all alone in the plaza of
the Clock Village of Rostolf?

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
Who is this despondent soul,

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
broke and starving, who looks
like she's about to cry?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
That's right, it's me.
I hate to admit it, but it's me.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sighs]

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose I could
make a lot of money

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
with freelance work.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[paper rustles]

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's see.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
Who is this from?

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
The Lavender Witch, Estelle.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
Now then, Elaina.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
Since you've come all this
way to pay me a visit,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
I can only assume you're here
answering my advertisement.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.604 position:50% align:center
Of course I am, and I
believe you mentioned

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:45.814 position:50% align:center
it was high-paying.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
So you're willing to work?

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.109 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
If it were possible,

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50% align:center
I'd much rather make
money without working.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.987 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.032 position:50% align:center
Motivation aside,
a witch is a witch.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.451 position:50% align:center
So, you strike me as
being fairly young.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.412 position:50% align:center
Are you?

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm actually 18 this year.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.000 position:50% align:center
When did you become a witch?

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
I got my title when I was 14.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50% align:center
Ah! Only a year
later than I did.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
Oh? And how old were you

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
when you started
your apprenticeship?

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
When I was ten, I think?

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.637 position:50% align:center
So it took you three
whole years to become

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
a full-fledged witch, then.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50% align:center
It took me just a single
year to accomplish that.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Mm...

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
May I ask how old
you are right now?

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.107 position:50% align:center
I'm only 19.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A year older than me.

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.740 position:50% align:center
Sorry. You're not making
fun of me, are you?

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
No, no. 'Course not.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.705 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could get
back to the money now?

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
You really don't care at all
what the job entails, do you?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
Very well. Let's talk
compensation, then, shall we?

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.596 position:50% align:center
Contingent upon
success, of course.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
You can expect to be paid in
full when the job is complete.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Are you serious?

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm very serious.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
Okay. But what kind of
"ultra-short-term" job

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.108 position:50% align:center
could possibly be worth
this much to you?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, you aren't getting
nervous now, are you?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.281 position:50% align:center
I'm simply looking for
someone to accompany me

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
on a little field trip of sorts.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.494 position:50% align:center
Field trip? Where to?

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
Tell me something.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
Do you know the story of
the Second District Murderer?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.918 position:50% align:center
The Second District Murderer?

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
I don't, but it doesn't
sound pleasant.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
No, it wasn't, and every word

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
of what they say is true.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Everyone here knows it.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
There's a book and even
a stage adaptation.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.265 position:50% align:center
Ten years ago...

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
...a burglar broke into
a home in the Second District.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
The wealthy couple inside

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
were brutally killed
in the confrontation.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
But their daughter,
Selena, survived,

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
as she was out
shopping at the time.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] The one bright
spot of this tragedy.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
It didn't last long, though.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
Selena was taken in by her uncle

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
and suffered horrible
abuse at his hands.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
Darkness grew inside her heart.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
And she quickly came
to despise other people,

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
and the entire wretched world.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
Eventually, she snapped
and murdered her uncle.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
She stabbed him over and over.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.429 position:50% align:center
And then she disappeared.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Is she...?

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Yes.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
She's the Second
District Murderer.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
Selena used to be my
best friend in the world.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
We were so close.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
You could say we were
almost like sisters.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
But I went to study
magic abroad.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
I was gone for years,
and by the time I came back,

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
Selena was already too far gone.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
She had tasted blood
and discovered obscene joy

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
in taking life,
killing again and again.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
Three years ago, she was
finally found and executed.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
I was the one
who had to do it.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
I caught her. And killed her.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
Beheaded her with my own hands.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
But the truth is...

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
I wish I could've helped her.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
She deserved a chance to atone.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, when you're
employed by the crown,

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
the king's orders are absolute.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA clears throat]
Back to the flyer.

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.213 position:50% align:center
Does this have anything to do

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
with the job posting
you put out?

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Where do you need me
to accompany you?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
It's important for you
to know the entire story,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
because you and I
are going to save her.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
We're what now?

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
Didn't you just tell me
that you beheaded the girl

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
three years ago?

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
I did.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
So we're going back
to ten years ago.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
You intend to travel
back in time?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
How's that going to work?

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
I made a vow on the day
of Selena's execution,

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
and began researching
time travel magic

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
to give us both another chance.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:17.085 position:50% align:center
I wanted to avoid that
heartbreaking ending.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
Going back to the beginning
is the only way.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
Ten years ago, that little girl
was still a decent human being.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Preventing the burglar from
killing Selena's parents

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
should be enough.
No uncle, no abuse.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
I'll be there
for her this time.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna live in a world
without her in it anymore.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
This will work. It has to.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
I understand the situation,

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
but not the need
for outside help.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
Once you actually arrive in
the past, why do you need me?

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.707 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Follow me.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] The method I
created to go back in time

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
is not simple by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.298 position:50% align:center
It wasn't something
I could accomplish

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
without making sacrifices.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
When a mage doesn't
have enough magic

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
to carry out a task, sacrificing
something of themselves

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
generates more, right?

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I've heard
of that being done.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Things like their voice
or their memories.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.483 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
And that's what you did?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
You don't seem
any worse for wear,

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.695 position:50% align:center
so what did you have to give up?

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Blood.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:28.573 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] I've been letting as
much as I can stand to store it.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
And I've been saving up
my natural power, as well.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
To travel back that far,
you need an astounding

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
amount of magic,
and I'm almost tapped.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
But it's still not enough.
So I only have one choice.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
Are you going to give
something else up?

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
That shouldn't be necessary,

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
but it will require every last
ounce of magic I have left.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
In other words, once you
arrive in the past,

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
you'll be completely
defenseless against any attack.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.316 position:50% align:center
So you decided you would hire
another witch to protect you,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
in case something should
happen while you're there?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Close, but not quite.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.033 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
What are those?

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
If we put these rings on,

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
we'll have access
to each other's magic.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.623 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
That's incredible.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
So, let me get
this straight, then.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
As long as both of us wear these
things, you can access my power

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
to do magic while you
have none of your own.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
That's correct.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
So, will you do it?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Well, I am a traveling witch.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
So naturally, I'm a
little interested to see

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
how different this
country was ten years ago.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
Are you ready, Elaina?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
All right, then.
Let's get going.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling okay?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
I'm fine. Just a little anemic.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
You're starting to sweat.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
I told you, I'm fine.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Are you sure
we should do this now?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm positive.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
If I don't take the
first chance I get,

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
who's to say if I'll
ever get another one?

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
So I'll ask you again.
Are you ready?

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
Yes, but the
question is, are you?

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
Absolutely. I've been
ready for years!

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
Ah! Sorry! I forgot
to tell you something!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.596 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, what is it?

00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.933 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Elaina!

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA giggles]
You're quite welcome.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] It certainly
looks like it worked.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
[paper rustles]

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
This paper is ten years old.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it,
you really did it.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry. Our time
limit here is one hour.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
Soon as the clock
strikes six, that's it.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Ready or not, we'll be
pulled back to the present.

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
Are you sure we can't
stick around longer?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
I would have bought
more time for us

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
if I could have, but...

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
Have faith. It's enough.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
As long as we keep a clear head,
in the next 60 minutes,

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
we're gonna change
the next ten years.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
I assume you have a plan?

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
In about 20 minutes,

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
a burglar who's wearing
a black hood is going

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
to break into Selena's home
and stab her parents repeatedly.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
All we should have
to do is get them out

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
before that happens,
and then ambush

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
the burglar ourselves.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:19.721 position:50% align:center
Piece of cake, right?

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
I just hope it all
goes smoothly.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure it does.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
This is all for Selena.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
With her parents alive, she'll
get to grow up healthy and safe.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:32.275 position:50% align:center
this will probably trigger
some pretty significant changes

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
in the ten-year-later Rostolf
we go back to, won't it?

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
No, that won't happen.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
Yes, we're meddling in the past.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't change the fact

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
that I kill Selena
in the future.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
You see,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
the world that we go back to
will be exactly the same

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
as when we left.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
But creating a world without
the murderer will cause

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.422 position:50% align:center
a brand-new timeline to branch
out, separate from our own.

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sorry if this
comes off as a bit rude,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
but what's the point
of saving her then?

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
That definitely
came off as rude.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.764 position:50% align:center
I just meant what's
the point if Selena

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
will still end up executed
in our own timeline?

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
But there is a point.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
Saving her will make it
easier for me to bear.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
Because it means there's
a different future

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
where Selena will be happy.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
That's all I want.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
And you truly believe
it will work?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
Yes, I honestly do.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Hey! Come back!

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
Selena!

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Selena.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
Um. Wow.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.760 position:50% align:center
Do I know you from somewhere?

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! It took me
so long to save you!

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
But I'm here now!
Please forgive me!

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
I don't get it. Save me?

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
This time, I will.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:55.066 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna save you
this time, I swear!

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[SELENA] Uh, is this like
a new way of proselytizing?

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
This must be weird. I'm sorry.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
I don't understand.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help myself.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
When I saw you,
I just wanted to hug you.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
That sounds like something
a pervert would do.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] What if I told you
I'm from the future?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
Uh... How fascinating,
but I should really

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
get back to my shopping now.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
Excuse me!

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Right. Of course.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
Not long now. I promise.

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
Goodness, she sure gave you
the cold shoulder, didn't she?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:31.269 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] That's just how
Selena's always been.

00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
She may act cold,
but deep down inside,

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
I know that she's a
very kind-hearted girl.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Trust me on this one.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
We don't have much time.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[SELENA'S FATHER] You're
Estelle's older half-sister?

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.832 position:50% align:center
I had no idea.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.959 position:50% align:center
But the two of you
do look a lot alike.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
They sure do.

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
You can see it in
the nape of your neck.

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
It's slender and graceful.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
It's exactly like Estelle's.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
That's really not important.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
But it's so strange.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
Oh, is it?

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I have a message
here from our father.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
He needs to talk to
you about something

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
that happened to Estelle
during her studies abroad.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
It's imperative that you
come with me immediately.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
This seems rather unusual.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
Well, we should go
and talk to him.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
He'll be so glad.
This way, please.

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
Good, they're both
going with Estelle.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
She'll get them to somewhere
safe, and once she gets back,

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.456 position:50% align:center
we can wait for the
burglar to appear.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
If everything goes as planned,

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
then it shouldn't
take much longer.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Shouldn't she be back by now?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
And where's the burglar?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] He broke in and
stabbed her parents repeatedly.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.143 position:50% align:center
Stabbed repeatedly.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
That seems a little
violent for something

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
as simple as a burglary.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
I wonder if someone
with a grudge did it

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.901 position:50% align:center
and then tried to
disguise the crime.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
It's possible.

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] And now my magic's
being sucked out of the ring.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
But if she's using my power,
then that means Estelle

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
must be fighting someone.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
It's most likely the burglar.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.256 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Fortunately,
there's no way that a knife

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
will ever hold up against
someone who can utilize magic.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
If Estelle is as
talented as she seems,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
then the whole fight
will probably be settled

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
by the time I even get there.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.893 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Is it already over?

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA gasps]

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
No. It couldn't be.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
The things we had imagined.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
The information we
thought we knew.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
Everything was wrong.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
Oh, yeah.

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Weren't you with this
weird lady earlier?

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
[SELENA giggles]
What now? You caught me.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll have to
kill you, too, huh?

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
How could you? They're dead.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.825 position:50% align:center
[SELENA] Because my parents are
nothing but abusive monsters.

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
My father did
perverted things to me,

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
and Mother became so jealous.

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
She would hit me
because of his attention,

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
but of course,
nobody ever noticed.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
Because we acted happy.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
So I decided
to kill them both.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
You think people
will forgive me?

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:49.175 position:50% align:center
No. Why would you think that?

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
I was so surprised!

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
It's funny that you
happened to show up

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
at the exact same time
I'd planned to kill them.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Tell me, did you guys actually
come from the future?

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.020 position:50% align:center
Why does that matter?

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
If it's true that you're

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
some kind of time-travelers,
then you must know stuff.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
Can you tell me what happens
to me in the future?

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
You get killed by
your best friend.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.950 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
Oh, wow. That sounds bad.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
And weird, since I don't
even have a best friend.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Hey. I think
I've figured it out!

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
I should've seen it sooner.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
This girl must be the
future Estelle, right?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
She is!

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.888 position:50% align:center
But why would she
wanna kill me?

00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
Because, Selena, you
become a murderer.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A murderer?

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I suppose
that makes sense.

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
How so?

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
[SELENA]
For starters,

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
killing people...

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
...is so...

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
...fun!

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
You're a monster.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
I won't forgive you.

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You were still alive?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.512 position:50% align:center
Guess I didn't stab you eno--

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.766 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:22.644 position:50% align:center
Selena!

00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Ow, ow, that hurts!

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't stop now!

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
This whole time,
you were just lying to me?

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.904 position:50% align:center
I thought we were
supposed to be friends!

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Look at you!

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
You're really trying
to kill me, aren't you?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
And when I become a murderer,
the future you will, too!

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
I came here because
we were friends!

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
I thought you would
go back to normal

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
if I could save your parents!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
But it was you
this entire time!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.881 position:50% align:center
You were always
the murderer! Liar!

00:18:51.965 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Ow! It hurts,
it hurts, it hurts,

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
it hurts, it hurts--

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
Monster! Demon!

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
And now we're both murderers.

00:19:12.235 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Estelle. Don't do this!

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Please don't. Not you.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
You're not... a murderer.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
Estelle.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Please come off!

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] I don't need
my memories of you.

00:19:42.432 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
Not one of them.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
They can all disappear.

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.855 position:50% align:center
Along with you, Selena.

00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
I should never have come
back here to save you.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have wasted
time thinking about you.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have felt
sorry about your death.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Just like I don't feel
sorry about it now.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
You have to die.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
You have to die.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.086 position:50% align:center
You have to die.

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
Selena. Farewell.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
[crunch]

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:26.309 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Estelle?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
You're Elaina, right?

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
What did I do? What happened?

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] So you don't
remember? About Selena?

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Who's that?

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] You sacrificed your
memories for more power.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE] I see. Was she
someone important to me?

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter, not anymore.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
[ESTELLE]
Okay.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
I couldn't stop it.

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
She killed her again.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
Murdered her best friend twice.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA] Who am I?
Just an ordinary traveler.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Just a normal witch.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA]
Inexperienced.

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.528 position:50% align:center
Too small to change anything.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
[ELAINA sobbing]
