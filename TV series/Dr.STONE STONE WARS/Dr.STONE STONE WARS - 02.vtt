[SENKU]
Just hang in there

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
until our paths cross
again, ya big oaf.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.684 position:50% align:center
We already had to wait 3,700
years to see each other.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50% align:center
A few more months or
even years is no big deal.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
Time is relative, ya know.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
But no matter how long it takes,

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
we will build our
kingdom of science.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.828 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Explosions?

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
Move! Now!

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] We're gonna get
the kingdom of science's

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
custom-built cell phone
to Taiju and Yuzuriha

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
even if it kills us!

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA] Why do we have to sneak
around like this anyway?

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Because if she spots us,
she'll likely follow us.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] And then our whole
top-secret cell phone plan

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
would be blown to pieces.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
Well, if we're so worried about
that scout, Homura, or whatever,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.991 position:50% align:center
all we gotta do is catch or kill
her and our problem's solved.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.243 position:50% align:center
We don't even know where
she's hiding, Magma!

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
However, right now, with all
the noise they just made,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
she'll have to leave her spot
to see what's happening.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
After all, they're worried
about our gunpowder supply.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center
Her job is to keep an eye on us,

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
so she can't ignore the
assive-may explosions going off.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
If Homura's gonna show herself,
it'll be along the line

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.599 position:50% align:center
between that hill and where
the sonic bombs went off.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50% align:center
I saw something just now!
A shadow moving really fast!

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA gasps]

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA]
She's already in pursuit.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center
Well, that's Kohaku.
She's so impressive.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
She sees a problem
and off she goes.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] Senku gave us this
one-in-a-million chance

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.871 position:50% align:center
with his sonic bombs.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
I have to catch her,
no matter what!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Those craters, from the blasts?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Chills.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
My neck.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] How can she move
like that? It's crazy!

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] Gymnastics. You, born
in this age, wouldn't know.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] I'm not trying
to kill you, okay?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Yes, back of your sword.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
How long will you chase me?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Until I catch you!

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
You can't, so give up.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
Stop running and come with me!

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
And why should I?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:31.187 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] She's trying to exhaust
me by making me talk, but...

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
Kohaku... I can't shake her.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.360 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] Homura...
I can't get any closer.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
She's fast.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] I'm gonna to have to
herd her toward the village.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
[gasps] They're coming this way!

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
Children and elders,
take shelter!

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
The rest of us
will surround her!

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Senku?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Heh. Curious, aren't ya?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
Turn your peepers over this way
and take a real good look!

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
Check out my shocking
science gadget--level two.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
It's a Flash Grenade.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
So bright!

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
What is that?!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
Long time no see, folks!
Mecha-Senku back again!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
And now, I'm gonna teach you all

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.373 position:50% align:center
how to make your
own flash grenades!

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
First, boil sea water. That'll
make this stuff called bittern.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
Then, you gather it up and
zap it with electricity.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
And blam! Magnesium acquired!

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
Shove it in a light bulb
and you're done.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.054 position:50% align:center
This is what they use
in Print Gocco.

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
Huh? You've really never
heard of Print Gocco?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
Well, your mom and dad might
know, so go ask them!

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
[GINRO] Senku's as weak
a flea, but look!

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA]
That was awesome!

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
Watch where you're
touching me, okay?

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
Heh. Sorry, but that old
trick's not gonna work on me.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
Once we've rebuilt
civilization, though,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
I can pretend to be a sweet,
innocent little boy

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
all you want.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Hmph.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] Force him off and run?
I doubt I'm stronger.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Huh? Ah!

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA, KASEKI, KOKUYO]
That was a total fail!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
He is weak as a flea!

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
Whoa. It's not about power!

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.191 position:50% align:center
[KINRO] You're right.
It's all about how she moves.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.237 position:50% align:center
No, she's getting away!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
I still can't see anything.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
I suppose your top-notch
vision's not helping us now.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Kinro. Ginro.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
Kohaku. Suika. Kaseki. Jasper.
Kokuyo. Turquoise. Mantle. Argo.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
How the heck do you know
what all of our names are?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
If her job has been to keep
watch on us this whole time,

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
it appears that she's taken
that task very seriously.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] But no Chrome,
Magma, or Gen.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Most of the villagers are here,
yet those three are missing.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
Something's wrong.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Where are they?

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
[GINRO whimpers]

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] Chrome has brains
and Magma has brawn.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
Are they mining for ore?

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
No. They wouldn't need Gen.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
What purpose would he serve?
To guide them? But to where?

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] They're taking
something to our base.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
This was all to distract me.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
Must be a critical weapon
of science. But what?

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
She must have figured it out.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
She knows Chrome and
them are on the move.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
This is bad!

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
I guess we can't count on
following her scent, huh?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
Chrome's team got a head start.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
Right now, they're racing toward
the Tsukasa empire's base.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.372 position:50% align:center
Homura's in hot pursuit.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
And when she finds them, she
finds the cell phone. Not good.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
If she destroys or she reports
it, we're so done for.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
[KASEKI]
Uh!

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
And that also means
all of our hard work

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
will have been for nothing!

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
So we're just gonna
have to catch her.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Homura's chasing after
Chrome and the others

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
and we're gonna have
to chase after her?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
Ah! That sounds tough!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
It's time to bust out
our ultimate weapon.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
AKA our surprise science
gadget--level three.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.112 position:50% align:center
Do you see all those
spots glowing?

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.573 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA] Yeah, they're
like marks of light.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:54.200 position:50% align:center
Well, there's no time
to lose, guys.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.453 position:50% align:center
I hope you're ready for this

00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.749 position:50% align:center
because we're about to begin
a fun little race within a race.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
So all of these glowing spots

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
are showing us Homura's path?

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA] Wait, but how come
we can see them like this?

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Heh. You guys need
to pay better attention.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
You've seen this twinkle before.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA]
Oh! The blue gemstone!

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
Yep. In powder form.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.776 position:50% align:center
I get it. You put it on
her arms and legs, huh?

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
But even still,
I thought that stuff

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
only lights up for a little
while right before dawn.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
Naturally, yes, but we can make

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
ultraviolet light
artificially using science.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
It's called a "black light."

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
Nickel, barium.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
We needed all those treasures
we found in the cave to make it.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
It's basically just a purple
light bulb we made

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
by mixing them with glass.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:55.261 position:50% align:center
This is great! Now we can
follow her with these.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
Hey, Senku, you
should know this.

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Huh?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
The way she moves is unusual.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:15.657 position:50% align:center
Gymnastics. It's a skill that
doesn't exist in this age.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] I don't think we
can capture her unharmed,

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
but if we need to,

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
I could stop using the back
of my sword and behead her.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
We could do it all without
spilling a single drop of blood.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Is that an option? To kill her?

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Kohaku, have you ever
killed a person before?

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Be honest.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
No, of course
I haven't, Senku!

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] That's why... I know
I'll hesitate when it's time.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
That is definitely
a weakness of mine,

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
so I have to acknowledge
it right now.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
For me to have the conviction
to go through with it,

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
I think I'm gonna need
some reassurance from you.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
Relax, okay?

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:09.085 position:50% align:center
Because if everything
goes according to my plan,

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
you won't even have to
use that awful thing.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU gasps]

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Heh. Why do you
think we worked so hard

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
on that ridiculously huge box?

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
I promise, it wasn't
just for fun.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
We've got the ultimate
weapon of modern times:

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
Information warfare.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA yells]

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
[CHROME, GEN]
No, no, no, no no!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Bad!

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
[GEN] If those tubes are
broken, we're in trouble.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
It looks all right,
but I think we should check it

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
every now and then
just to make sure.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.242 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
Is someone there?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Stop! I don't think we
should answer right now!

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
But why not?

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
It stopped ringing.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
I can only think of one reason

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
that they'd want to contact us
at this stage of the plan,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.464 position:50% align:center
and with only one ring...

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
...Homura must have spotted us,
and we're being followed.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
She's from my time,
so if she saw us talking,

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
she'd realize we're
carrying a cell phone.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
The best thing to do
is just keep going

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:11.064 position:50% align:center
and act like we don't
have a clue about her.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] This race is like
two games of tag in one.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
There's Chrome's team
carrying the cell phone,

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
Homura who's chasing them,
and we're all chasing Homura.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
Check it, though.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
You wanna know what happens

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
if we use radio waves to
coordinate our movements?

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
We could turn our little game
of tag into a pincer attack!

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
And that's information warfare.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
I'm coming, Hyoga.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:13:00.196 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center
Bad news. The light spots
end at this river.

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
Dang, she must've washed
off the tracking powder.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.456 position:50% align:center
I'll bet she noticed
it this morning.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
By the way, Senku,

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
how come this thing won't
stop ringing like this?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Oh, that? Nothin' to
worry about at the moment.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
It's Gen sending us a message.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
He's using something
called Morse Code.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
We can't use voice, so that
forces us to text each other.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
It makes sense if you
think about it that way.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Not to me, Senku.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
We're not from your
scientific era, ya know.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Gen's reported
locations and Homura's route

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
have synced up for the
past several kilometers.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
So you're telling us that
Homura has caught up to them

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.615 position:50% align:center
and now she's right
on their tail?

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Heh. That information's
worth its weight in gold.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.496 position:50% align:center
'Cause with Homura
directly in front of us,

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
and with us communicating our
positions via the cell phones,

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
we can see where every
piece is on the board...

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
...and pull off the pincer move.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
It's not orking-way.
There's no signal anymore.

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chrome, think you
can put it up a tree?

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
"Signal"?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.768 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] No way!
Not in the stone world!

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
A communicator?

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] I'm a scout.
That means I have to make sure.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
I'll destroy it right now.
Might be my only chance.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
A fake? But how?

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Gen, his sleight of hand.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center

[HOMURA]
No. Can't land safely.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
This is it. I'm dead.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
Goodbye, Hyoga.

00:14:57.772 --> 00:14:59.190 position:50% align:center
Now go!

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Ah! You may be crazy
fast and nimble,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
but if we know right
where you're gonna be,

00:15:13.038 --> 00:15:15.290 position:50% align:center
and exactly when
you're gonna be there,

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
then we can still
capture you unharmed.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
Get excited, you guys.
This is information warfare.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
Brought to you by the
kingdom of science.

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
We made it.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
Finally! We're here!

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
The home base of the
final boss Tsukasa!

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
Don't yell like that, Chrome!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa has a guy with insanely
good hearing in his army.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that!

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
It'd suck to get caught
after coming all this way.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
That statue looks bad, guys.

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, all of
them look pretty scary to me.

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
Something's written
in blood on its face.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
I think they're priority numbers
that order when to revive them.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
And I'm positive they weren't
there last time I saw these.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
The lowest number is 33.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
Which means...
since I've been gone,

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
ol' Tsukasa has revived 32
people at the very least.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
Awfully, quick, huh?
Seems he's in a hurry.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
Even if we can convince
some of his people

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
to come over to our side,

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:55.056 position:50% align:center
we may not be able to keep up
with how fast he's making 'em.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that is a real oblem-pray.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.852 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Why don't we just smash
all of these stupid things

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
and be done with it now?

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
No, that's way too much work.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
All we gotta do is break
off their arms or legs

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
as we find them and they
won't be able to fight.

Wow. You're pretty
damn brutal, Magma.

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
You're kind of an ally now,
so I forgot about that.

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center

being that big

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
on showing ercy-may in the past.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:27.422 position:50% align:center
Although, logically,
he does make a valid point.

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
It's probably best to destroy
them while we have the chance.

These statues have done

Maybe if we knew they were
major villains or something.

I talk like a strong pragmatist,

going to live or die,

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
I'm actually quite weak.

It's true.

Tsukasa is an earsome-fay foe

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
because he doesn't
have those reservations.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
That's why we have to stop him.

you're weak, Gen.

can grow his army.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
we're quite uky-lay
you're on our side, big guy.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:01.808 position:50% align:center
Where are we?

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
At a gravesite.

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
Is it for Tsukasa's guys?

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.396 position:50% align:center
No, sir.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
So whose, then?

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
This grave is for Senku.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
You mean Senku's dead?!

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
Come on, man,
he's obviously still alive.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
This is just to keep up the
illusion and throw off Tsukasa.

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] We have them
thinking I'm dead,

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
so you'd better visit
my grave regularly.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Ha! Our communication spot

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center
is really at your grave, huh?

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect sacred ground.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
Considering Tsukasa's men have
no interest in me or my grave.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
And if your friends
go there often,

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:45.769 position:50% align:center
it'll look like they're
paying respects.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.730 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] It is a place to go
converse with the dead.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.900 position:50% align:center
This is the birth of
the ghost communicator.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.112 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
What a illiant-bray plan.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
Nothing odd about going to a
gravesite to talk to the dead.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
But I will say... it's looking
a little obvious, ya know?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
You're gonna draw too much
attention with all that stuff!

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
Dumb stone's in the way.
Man, that's bad.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
[GEN, CHROME scream]

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.432 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] You don't give a damn
about anything, do you, Magma?

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
Just hurry up and bury it!

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Okay. It looks like we
pulled it off, you guys.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
You little wimps freak
out way too much.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
It's still too early to say.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you? There's
a guy with azy-cray hearing.

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.371 position:50% align:center
[GEN wheezes]

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:47.622 position:50% align:center
[GEN screams]

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
This is bad!

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] I know I definitely heard
something right around here.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA]
Tsukasa's guys.

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
If one of them finds the cell
phone first, it's all over.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center
That's why the
mentalist is there.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
He'll know the best
way to cover it up.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.320 position:50% align:center
And I'm not worried at
all about my friends.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
They're a tag team
of diligence and guts.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:27.287 position:50% align:center
No matter how well it's hidden,
those two will find it.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[ringing]

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's ringing!

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:41.926 position:50% align:center
Hang on! What if it's
one of Tsukasa's people?

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.559 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Yo.

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:04.783 position:50% align:center
Senku!

00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.911 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
I missed you guys so much,
I could almost start crying.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
Even your ridiculously
loud voice, ya big oaf.
