[SENKU]
We have them thinking I'm dead,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.458 align:middle
so you'd better visit
my grave regularly.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:11.875 align:middle
Taiju.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.125 align:middle
See that? It looks like
someone dug around here.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.375 align:middle
[TAIJU]
Hm? You're right.

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:22.333 align:middle
Good eye, Yuzuriha. Way to go.

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:24.083 align:middle
You think it was Senku?

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.625 align:middle
Maybe he and his team
buried something here for us.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.458 align:middle
[YUZURIHA]
What do we do?

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle
She's watching us like a hawk,

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.458 align:middle
so we can't just get a
shovel and start digging.

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.458 align:middle
[NIKKI] They come to visit
this grave every day.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:41.458 align:middle
Why? Are they talking to
the dead or something?

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:44.542 align:middle
I got this.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.917 align:middle
[YUZURIHA]
Huh?

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle

Yo.

[chuckles]

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:33.042 align:middle
I missed you guys so much,
I could almost start crying.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:37.083 align:middle
Even your ridiculously
loud voice, ya big oaf.

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.667 align:middle

Whoa!

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.875 align:middle
Is this the guy we've
been hearing about?

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:41.958 align:middle
That's Taiju?

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:46.042 align:middle
Woo-hoo! It's finally
been connected!

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle
Our cell phone hot line works,
and over such a long distance!

It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.125 align:middle
Hard to believe almost
a year's passed.

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:00.625 align:middle
Senku, I...

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:03.958 align:middle
I am... Senku.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:11.625 align:middle
[TAIJU]
I am... Senku. I am... Senku.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle
I am Senku!

00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:19.667 align:middle
No, you're not, 'cause I'm
Senku. Get it together.

[TAIJU wails]

00:04:58.042 --> 00:04:59.292 align:middle
[TAIJU]
Senku!

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:01.792 align:middle
So the thing's called
a "cell phone"?

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.708 align:middle
And it makes it possible
to talk to someone

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.625 align:middle
who's really far away.

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:08.708 align:middle
I can't even begin to
understand how it works.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:12.208 align:middle
Voices dancing across
the sky. So far.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle
The science of "radio
waves" is connecting us

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.292 align:middle
all the way to the
enemy's home base.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:20.042 align:middle
It's amazing, Father!

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:23.083 align:middle
[chuckles] Are you done
blubbering yet, you big oaf?

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:24.708 align:middle
You're killin' me, here.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.917 align:middle
I'm sorry about that, man.
I'm just so happy.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle
Hey, Senku.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.375 align:middle
[SENKU]
Yo, Yuzuriha.

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:35.083 align:middle
You worked all the way up to
cell phones in just a year, huh?

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle
Heh. I always knew you
were incredible, but wow.

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.458 align:middle
[NIKKI]
Huh...?

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:44.458 align:middle
What's up? Why are they
wailing and crying so much?

00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:46.583 align:middle
Is it the anniversary
of the guy's death?

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:48.917 align:middle
I'd love to sit here and
talk about how awesome

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle
my homemade cell phone is,

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.292 align:middle
or just catch up on all the
crazy stuff that's happened

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.667 align:middle
for the next ten billion years,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.917 align:middle
but I know we're way too short
on time for that kinda crap.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.417 align:middle
So, I'll get straight
to the point.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.167 align:middle
Listen carefully.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.583 align:middle
You gotta get someone over
there to leave the group.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.458 align:middle
Have 'em come over
to the cell phone.

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:09.583 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.542 align:middle
[SENKU]
Give 'em whatever bogus reason.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.625 align:middle
I'll fill in the details later.

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle
Uh. Are you sure you don't
need to rehearse this first?

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:19.417 align:middle
I'll bet that there's a guard
watching them right now,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.875 align:middle
so it's probably not
a viable option.

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.292 align:middle
As a matter of fact, Taiju,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:25.708 align:middle
it'll be better if you
don't know anything.

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle
Just stay dumb and believe
whatever weird stuff I say.

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.417 align:middle
Are you trying to piss him off?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.917 align:middle
'Cause I wouldn't
put up with all of that!

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.708 align:middle
[TAIJU] Senku, let me
make sure of one thing.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:40.042 align:middle
[SENKU]
Hm?

00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:45.292 align:middle
You swear, your plan,
it's how we can avoid bloodshed?

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:50.917 align:middle
Yeah. With my way,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.083 align:middle
[TAIJU]
All right, works for me, Senku.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:54.458 align:middle
If you say it's the best way,

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.667 align:middle
then you don't need to
explain anything else.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.458 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.708 align:middle
Even though they've
been apart for a year,

00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle
they still have absolute
trust in one another.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.375 align:middle
I think I see how they did it.

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.875 align:middle
How Senku and his friends
could survive against Tsukasa.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle
[SENKU]
We don't have much time left

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.917 align:middle
until Tsukasa's Army
launches a full-on attack.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.833 align:middle
As soon as Gen gets
back to our base,

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:22.667 align:middle
the mission begins
in full swing.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.958 align:middle
Have you gotten any
messages from Gen?

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle
Huh? No. At least,
none I know about.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:30.083 align:middle
We just noticed the ground
had been dug up,

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:31.542 align:middle
and then found the receiver.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.208 align:middle
[gasps]

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:34.417 align:middle
Oh, dear.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.375 align:middle
So that means they just
happened to find it

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.083 align:middle
by a stroke of pure luck.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.042 align:middle
That's not Gen's style.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.875 align:middle
No. Something must've happened.

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:55.333 align:middle
Why are we hiding in the bushes

00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:57.667 align:middle
like a bunch of damn
cowards, anyway?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.042 align:middle
'Cause if we run into the enemy,

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.167 align:middle
I'm just gonna straight-up
murder the guy!

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.458 align:middle
We don't even have a clue
where they are, bonehead!

00:08:03.542 --> 00:08:04.792 align:middle
People who just rush
out like that

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:07.958 align:middle
are always the
first ones to die!

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.542 align:middle
The one stalking us now is Ukyo.

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:15.333 align:middle
He's got an uper-say sense
of hearing. It's unreal.

00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:18.708 align:middle
So then being in
these bushes is bad.

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle
Bingo.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle
If we keep scurrying around,

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:24.083 align:middle
all the rustling
sounds'll tip him off.

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.958 align:middle
Trust me, we'd definitely
get shot then.

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:31.458 align:middle
Actually, the reason we're
here hiding right now

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.667 align:middle
is because he lured
us into them.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.583 align:middle
He wants us here.

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:36.833 align:middle
Ah, damn.

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:38.542 align:middle
Gen's gotta get back to
the kingdom of science,

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle
with or without us.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:42.125 align:middle
We need him there to
pull off this whole plan

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:46.167 align:middle
with the cell phone and take
down the Tsukasa empire.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.583 align:middle
[MAGMA]
Ah.

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:50.417 align:middle
If all we gotta do is get
Gen home, I have an idea.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.917 align:middle
[GEN, CHROME]
Huh?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.625 align:middle

gonna charge right out.

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.417 align:middle
And I'll be right behind you!

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.708 align:middle

Ah-ha! Now I see!

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:12.667 align:middle
Or not! If we do that, I'll die!

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.167 align:middle
Come on!

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle
So you're not willing to die
for the cause, huh, Chrome?

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:19.625 align:middle
Only worried about yourself,
ya selfish bastard, you!

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.417 align:middle
Seriously?!

to give Taiju and Yuzuriha.

There's a "positive"
and "negative," right?

All I need to do is
connect the ends

00:09:39.875 --> 00:09:44.042 align:middle
and it'll make the wire heat
right up, like, crazy bad.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.958 align:middle
The noise and smoke would
give away our position

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:48.375 align:middle
if we sat there rubbing
wood to start a fire,

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:51.333 align:middle

we can do it in a flash!
