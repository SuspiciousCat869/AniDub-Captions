There's one major obstacle.

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:17.958 align:middle
I'm sure you guys know
how strong Tsukasa is,

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:19.958 align:middle
but he's not our only worry.

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.875 align:middle
He's surrounded himself with
some really powerful people.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.875 align:middle
It must be a part of his
grandiose vision for the world.

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.333 align:middle
Because he's gathered lots
of very capable folks

from all over.

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:33.292 align:middle

worship at his feet

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.417 align:middle
but once they get a taste
of his power and charisma,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.292 align:middle
they'll pretty much do
whatever he asks of them

there are clearly two
guys at the very top.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.292 align:middle
I guess you could call them
his "right and left arms,"

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.625 align:middle
but in any case, he considers
them his most capable allies.

You've already had a

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:52.375 align:middle
Nobody's gonna catch her!

00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:55.333 align:middle
[SENKU] Get back here!
Right now, lioness!

00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.875 align:middle
I'm not a lioness!

00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.875 align:middle
[OTHERS]
Whoa! She stopped!

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.375 align:middle
Father, let me go!

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:01.958 align:middle
[KOKUYO]
Don't be a fool!

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:04.708 align:middle
You think you can charge into
enemy territory all by yourself?

00:11:04.792 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
Ugh! I gotta do something!

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle
We can't abandon Chome;
he's one of us!

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.167 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.792 align:middle
[SENKU]
If she can't do it on her own,

00:11:12.875 --> 00:11:14.708 align:middle
then how about all
of us go together?

00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:15.875 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.583 align:middle
We all go?

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:24.292 align:middle
The kingdom of science
is mobilizing our army.

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle
Now that Homura the scout
has been taken care of,

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:29.375 align:middle
there's no reason for us
to wait any longer.

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:33.542 align:middle
So let's move out and set up
camp near the Tsukasa empire.

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.875 align:middle
From there, we'll
have a better shot

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.917 align:middle
at bringing Chrome
back in one piece.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.208 align:middle
[ALL chattering]

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:41.625 align:middle
This is so scary.

00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:44.625 align:middle
I don't wanna go near the
Tsuskasa empire, you guys!

00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:47.333 align:middle
Hey, how about we just hold our
ground here and wait instead?

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:49.333 align:middle
That's not a bad strategy, huh?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.583 align:middle
Winter will be over
in a couple of weeks.

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.375 align:middle
If we just sit here and wait,

00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:55.583 align:middle
they'll march on over
and wipe us out.

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:59.083 align:middle
She's right. Offense is our best
defense in this situation.

00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:01.625 align:middle
I know! I thought
the same thing, too!

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:03.708 align:middle
Oh, really, Ginro?

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:06.958 align:middle
Are you planning to bring all
the science gear with us, Senku?

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle
Odds are ten billion
to one without it.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:11.625 align:middle
We'll need everything we've got
if we wanna get Chrome back

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:13.833 align:middle
and then go on to
defeat Tsukasa.

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.083 align:middle
But all this stuff's so heavy.

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:19.333 align:middle
If we can't carry it
there, what then?

00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:20.542 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.875 align:middle
Not gonna be an issue.

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:27.583 align:middle
[GEN]
Huh?

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:35.083 align:middle
There's no way!

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.625 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:38.917 align:middle
We're gonna make a car!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle
[GEN]
Here we go! Eriously-say?

00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:44.708 align:middle
[SENKU]
Heh. Get excited, everyone!

00:12:44.792 --> 00:12:46.792 align:middle
[GEN] Yeah, I mean,
of course I'm excited,

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle
but I'm amazed how you
can still manage to have

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle
this kind of fun given
the circumstances.

00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.292 align:middle
[KASEKI]
Woo-hoo!

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:06.458 align:middle
Is that some kind of crazy
schematic? Or what?

00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:09.208 align:middle
[SUIKA] There are so many lines,
and circles, and triangles,

00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:11.542 align:middle
it's making my head spin!

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.708 align:middle
[GEN] I don't think I've seen
you get this excited, Senku.

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:15.792 align:middle
[SENKU laughs]

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:17.833 align:middle
Well, I've never built
a full-size car,

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:21.583 align:middle
but this is like a giant Mini
four-wheel drive model.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.292 align:middle
All right, we're
gonna go with this.

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:25.083 align:middle
It's like, ten billion
times more primitive

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:27.333 align:middle
than what I used to use
in my old model rockets,

00:13:27.417 --> 00:13:29.292 align:middle
but it'll work for what we need.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle
It'll run on a wobbler engine!

00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle
[OTHERS whimper]

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle
Just gotta throw this
in some boiling water.

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:39.833 align:middle
Honeycomb.

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:42.792 align:middle
Yeah, the honeycomb saga.

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:46.708 align:middle
We had to gather it in order to
make plastic for the cell phone.

00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:52.667 align:middle
[GEN] And got attacked by a ton
of bess. It was the orst-way.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.542 align:middle
We looked like human
marshmallows after that,

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:58.125 align:middle
and then we ended up not even
using it for the plastic,

00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.208 align:middle
so it felt even orse-way.

00:14:00.292 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:04.333 align:middle
[SENKU] It was just a byproduct
of gathering honey, anyway.

00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:05.583 align:middle
We didn't need it
because we ended up

00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:07.542 align:middle
with a simpler shape
for our cell phone.

00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:10.958 align:middle
But our parts this time around
are gonna be way more complex.

00:14:11.042 --> 00:14:13.667 align:middle
Your sacrifice wasn't in vain.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.333 align:middle
Boiling that honeycomb down
into a block gives us beeswax.

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle
Uh. Like, a candle?

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle
[SENKU] It's also what
you use to make crayons

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:24.458 align:middle
and lipstick and stuff.

00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:27.583 align:middle
[GEN] Huh? And we're gonna
make an engine out of it?

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:34.292 align:middle
[KASEKI]
Woo-hoo!

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:37.917 align:middle
This spinny doohickey makes
the carving go nice and smooth!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.625 align:middle
[SENKU] It's a waterwheel lathe.
Basically, a rotating cutter.

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:44.167 align:middle
We'll make our intricate
parts with this.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.167 align:middle
But the wax just seems so
fragile and brittle to me.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.958 align:middle
Will it really work?

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:52.292 align:middle
Yeah, won't be a
millimeter of trouble.

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:53.875 align:middle
We'll use plaster to form a mold

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.333 align:middle
around the parts
we make from wax.

00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.917 align:middle
And then, pour melted
brass into the mold.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.458 align:middle
[GEN] Ah, so we aren't
actually using wax parts.

00:15:02.542 --> 00:15:04.375 align:middle
Should've been obvious.

00:15:06.167 --> 00:15:07.375 align:middle
Do we really have to tear down

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:09.292 align:middle
the nice stove Senku
made for us?

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.667 align:middle
I realize winter will be over
soon, but what's he need it for?

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.333 align:middle
I don't have a clue.

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:17.833 align:middle
Senku says he wants it
for something, though.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.542 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
He was so happy about it,

00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:20.708 align:middle
then he said something like,

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:22.958 align:middle
"Science is all
about recycling!"

00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:24.292 align:middle
Whatever that means.

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:28.333 align:middle
[RURI] Not sure, but I can
picture him saying it.

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:30.792 align:middle
[SENKU] We're putting the
whole stove on the car.

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle
Pretty simple, really.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle
Just heat up some water
and you've got steam.

00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:36.167 align:middle
[KASEKI]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle
See, Kaseki.

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:39.542 align:middle
We're gonna attach the
little part you just built

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle
right there on the end.

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:45.167 align:middle
The steam'll push it downward.
Works like a reverse pump.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.333 align:middle
[KASEKI]
Mh-hm! Mh-hm! Mh-hm! Mh-hm!

00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:49.542 align:middle
[SENKU] Put that reverse
pump onto a disc

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle
and it'll push, turn, and pull.

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.458 align:middle
That's the wobbler engine!

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.667 align:middle
--[KASEKI yells]
--[SENKU chuckles]

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.792 align:middle
You guys are having the time
of your lives over there,

00:15:58.875 --> 00:15:59.917 align:middle
aren't you?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.667 align:middle
Looks to me like
they totally forgot

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.208 align:middle
that the whole point
of building this thing

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:04.667 align:middle
was so we could move
everyone closer

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.417 align:middle
to enemy territory
and rescue Chrome.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.833 align:middle
[chuckles] Don't worry about it,

00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:12.375 align:middle
'cause Tsukasa's guys
probably all think

00:16:12.458 --> 00:16:14.792 align:middle
Chrome's just a wimpy villager.

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:17.833 align:middle
I'm sure they're taking good
care of him as a hostage.

00:16:17.917 --> 00:16:20.917 align:middle
As long as he keeps his
mouth shut, he'll be fine.

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:24.208 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
But it's Chrome.

00:16:25.292 --> 00:16:29.208 align:middle
"As long as he keeps his
mouth shut, he'll be fine"?

00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:30.583 align:middle
But it's Chrome.

00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle
She said it twice.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle
Hm?

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.042 align:middle
[SENKU]
Let's pick up the pace.

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.167 align:middle
[KASEKI chuckles nervously]

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle
[KASEKI]
We've got a lotta work to do.

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.583 align:middle
[MEN chattering]

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.833 align:middle
[MAN A]
What's up? What's goin' on?

00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle
[MAN B]
The top three guys are in there.

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:53.417 align:middle
Ukyo. Hyoga. And Tsukasa.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle
[MAN A] Who's the dude
with the headband?

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:57.625 align:middle
So why did you make the decision

00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:00.208 align:middle
to tell me that
you're a scientist?

00:17:00.292 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle
Senku must've explained
the situation,

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:05.417 align:middle
so I'm sure that you know
that was quite a risky move.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.958 align:middle
You bet I do!

00:17:07.042 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle
And I know that you're
a science-hating jerk.

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle
Sounds like you need to be
taught a lesson to me.

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:17.667 align:middle
And I... can teach you
how cool science is!

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.375 align:middle
I hope you're ready!

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:23.792 align:middle
'Cause first... we've
got rainbow flames!

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.917 align:middle
[CHROME]
Crap, I messed up. Like bad.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.042 align:middle
I should've pitched ramen
or cotton candy first.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.667 align:middle
[HYOGA] Would you like
to tell us what really

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.208 align:middle
brings a scientist
like you here?

00:17:45.292 --> 00:17:49.167 align:middle
Of course, if you don't,
you'll just end up dead.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.458 align:middle
[CHROME] I can't tell them I
came here to bring a cell phone.

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle
This is it.
I'm really gonna die.

00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:58.708 align:middle
This is bad!

00:17:58.792 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle
Now, Chrome, it's not
that I'm completely opposed

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle
to a scientific civilization.

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:08.875 align:middle
I mean, we have fire and
tools here, of course.

00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:12.542 align:middle
Those are excellent
ways to use science.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.375 align:middle
But you have no idea
how things were before.

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:18.833 align:middle
The world I lived in was
tainted by powerful forces

00:18:18.917 --> 00:18:22.708 align:middle
who used weapons of science
for unspeakable crimes.

00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:25.208 align:middle
It's why we need restraint.

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle
Our miraculous and beautiful
world was purified by someone--

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.958 align:middle
for some reason--

00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle
and now Senku is trying
to tarnish it once again.

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:35.833 align:middle
[HYOGA]
This is a golden opportunity.

00:18:35.917 --> 00:18:39.042 align:middle
The perfect time for you
to join us, Chrome.

00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:42.417 align:middle
[TSUKASA]
If you bring us Senku's head,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle
I promise you'll have
all the colored fire

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:46.542 align:middle
and science tricks
to keep you happy.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.667 align:middle
Plus, my guarantee that all
the people in your village

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.125 align:middle
will be safe.

00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:51.958 align:middle
[CHROME]
Hmm, well...

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:54.875 align:middle
That sounds a hell of
a lot better than dying.

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:00.875 align:middle
That is what you want
me to say, right?

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:04.125 align:middle
Just drop me. Hurry it up.

00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:06.042 align:middle
[HYOGA]
So be it.

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.917 align:middle
[TSUKASA]
Even in the face of death,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.583 align:middle
he never flinched
or lost conviction.

00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:41.833 align:middle
[yells]

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.708 align:middle
[CHROME]
A bridge?

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:51.792 align:middle
There's no point in
pushing him any further.

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:55.667 align:middle
He won't turn, for neither
carrot nor stick.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.417 align:middle
[HYOGA] Then it seems
we'll just have to guess

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle
as to why he's come here.

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:02.833 align:middle
Ukyo, where did you
find him again?

00:20:04.292 --> 00:20:05.625 align:middle
[CHROME]
Oh, man.

00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:09.458 align:middle
Ukyo knows we were up to
something at the gravesite.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.333 align:middle
It won't take long for
them to go check it out

00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:13.792 align:middle
and find the cell phone.

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.625 align:middle
Damn it, this is bad.

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:19.375 align:middle
Shit! We're screwed! Shit!

00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:25.667 align:middle
He was at the miracle cave, just
scouting it out all by himself.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.833 align:middle
I'll bet he's after
the nitric acid.

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:30.667 align:middle
[CHROME]
What's going on?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.917 align:middle
Not that I don't wanna live,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.375 align:middle
but why would he lie
to Hyoga and Tsukasa?

00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:41.125 align:middle
Man. I've got a bad feeling
about this Ukyo guy.

00:20:41.208 --> 00:20:43.958 align:middle
Is he trying to start a
revolution or something?

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.958 align:middle
Like, take over
the Tsukasa empire?

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:55.042 align:middle
[ALL gasping]

00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:57.417 align:middle
It's just a big model kit.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.792 align:middle
All we gotta do to assemble
it is weld it together.

00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:07.875 align:middle
Ho-oh!

00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.292 align:middle
Whoa. What is this thing?

00:21:13.542 --> 00:21:15.042 align:middle
[GINRO]
Whoa!

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:18.167 align:middle
Yay! Now all of us can
go and rescue Chrome!

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.792 align:middle
It's like we built a living
creature. It's incredible!

00:21:27.292 --> 00:21:30.167 align:middle
[laughs] "A living
creature," huh?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.917 align:middle
She's never seen an object
that moves on its own.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.083 align:middle
It makes sense to me.

00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:47.875 align:middle
[GEN]
It's finally here!

00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle
We're in... the
Industrial Revolution!

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.708 align:middle
The kingdom of science railway
line is up and running.

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle
Now full steam ahead.

00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:19.625 align:middle
[SENKU]
Straight to the Tsukasa empire.
