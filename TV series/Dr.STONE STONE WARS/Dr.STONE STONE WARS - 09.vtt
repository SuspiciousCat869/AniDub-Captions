This is siege warfare.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
If we can buy even a
little bit of time, then...

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, but in
case you forgot,

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.436 position:50% align:center
we're out of chemicals
and stuff!

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Run, scientist!

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
On it!

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
They'll be dying for nothing.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.739 position:50% align:center
I suppose they're just
brain-dead barbarians after all.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
[SENKU, TSUKASA]
In this primitive stone world,

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
the winner will be decided by...

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] ...the force granted
to humanity by nature:

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
Strength.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] ...the fruit of
humanity's endless efforts:

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
Science!

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
This is the final battle!

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
We have to defend
the miracle cave!

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Don't tell me you're
gonna to try to make

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
some science-y weapon-type thing

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
while the battle team's out
there holding off Tsukasa.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.344 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.511 position:50% align:center
But they totally destroyed

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.472 position:50% align:center
all of our science-y
chemical-type stuff.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.058 position:50% align:center
We're egit-lay out
of everything now!

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Focus, Chrome! Get over here
and help us, would you?

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
Heh. Look, he's probably
got some ideas. Leave him be.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.444 position:50% align:center
[GEN sighs]

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
Your trust in him's
ext-nay level.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Something caught my eye.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
I've built up some crazy bad
intuition over the years,

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
and it's telling me there's
something on the battlefield

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
that's a scientific
game changer!

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] My science starts
with hunting for materials!

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
Keep 'em surrounded
but maintain distance.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
We don't wanna face Tsukasa
and Hyoga in a head-on fight!

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, they're like
the ultimate tag team!

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
For real, and they're both
unstoppable on their own!

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
He's vulnerable while
he's up in the air!

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
This could be our last
chance to beat him!

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
Taiju! Use the shock cannon!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
Nikki! You guys!

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's go!

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
[MEN yelling]

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Nasty.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.106 position:50% align:center
So you want me to mix
this snake or lizard poop

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
or whatever in here?

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Nitric acid plus
urea makes urea nitrate.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
It's not the most
effective weapon,

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.947 position:50% align:center
but it's better than nothing.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
I'm not following you.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] If the uric acid
in the feces is intact,

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.246 position:50% align:center
meaning it's quality poop,
we'll get white crystals.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
You're saying, if we're lucky,

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
we can use these white crystals
as some kind of science weapon?

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it's up to
the luck of the draw!

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, I remember now.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
I've said this before, Senku,

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
but your luck of the draw
pretty consistently...

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
...eally-ray ucks-say.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
Not so bad.
I'd rather not kill you.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] The little one
popped up from behind.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
It's a two-man move.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.587 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Looks like
they've distracted him

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
and triangulated.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
They're more capable
than I expected.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
Still, I'm sure Tsukasa
won't have any trouble

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
dealing with them.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU yells]

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] I won't let you
get in the way, Hyoga.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
You're up against me, now.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:55.438 position:50% align:center
Let's just call it
a revenge match.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA, GINRO yelling]

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
[KINRO yells]

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
[KOKUYO]
Magma. Kinro. Ginro. Hang on.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Isn't there something else
we can use besides poop?

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
Y'know, maybe like some
nice flowers or even paper.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
I'm a magician, so I have all
kinds of tricks up my sleeve.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
Ya got any sufurina?

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
I definitely wouldn't
have that stuff on me.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
I make it a habit not to carry
around anything that dangerous.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
If I had sulfuric acid to
mix with the miracle water,

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
nitric acid, I could
make a mixed acid,

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
and then use that to--

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.621 position:50% align:center
No point, it's all hypothetical
and a waste of time.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
I have some!

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
I've got it. Sulfuric acid.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Whoa, Chrome! Where the
heck did you find that?

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:10.764 position:50% align:center
What? Did you forget already?
It's from our opening volley.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
It's the leftovers from
our bluff tank cannon.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.937 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Nice work, scavenger king.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
And we'll throw this
in to top it off.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
It's chock full of glycerin.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
[CHROME, GEN]
Soap?

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] It's been useful as
hell from the very beginning.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Come to think of it,

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
this is one of the first science
items I showed Tsukasa.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] It's a lifesaver in
a world without doctors.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
You can call it "Dr. Stone."

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.259 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Our battle
started out with soap,

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
and it looks like now...
soap is gonna be what ends it.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Huh?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
This is just the
thing I was after.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
Even if you stab me with it,
I'm still not letting go.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
Hyoga, without your precious
weapon, you're powerless.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.161 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA sighs]

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
My spare!

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
You can keep that one.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
In times of despair,

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
mediocre people always
resort to futile resistance.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Ha! But I'm far from despair.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Huh?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
You really don't get it.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
Everything starts to add up--
be it strength or science.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50% align:center
We might be weak on our own,
but all our contributions

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
combine to form
something greater.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
The battle team buys time

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
for Senku and the science
team to turn it around.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:54.993 position:50% align:center
Because all of us believe
in Senku... and in science!

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
What's this yellow liquid?

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
It has a really
sweet smell to it.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
Does your head hurt, too?

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
Shh! Don't even breathe!

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
One little drop of this stuff
makes a big boom.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
We'd all be beyond dead meat.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
This is nitroglycerin.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
Nitro--? I've definitely
heard of that before!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
It's like uper-say dangerous!

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
it's ridiculously dangerous.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
So I should say, "Don't you
dare try this at home, kids."

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
Nobody's going to try this.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
Hang on! Are you planning
on blowin' 'em all up?

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
No, you idiot. I'm planning
on saving everybody.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
The question is,

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
how do we get this to the
other side of the battlefield

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
without making it explode first?

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.843 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
No you don't!

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
I won't let you get near Senku!

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Hey, Tsukasa!

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
This isn't a battle between
strength and science.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
Because science
actually is strength.

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
[GEN] This design won the
Guinness World record

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
for longest flying
paper airplane.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] This has about a hundred
times the power of gunpowder.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
There's a word you know
that came straight

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
from the Ancient Greek
word for "power."

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.900 position:50% align:center
And that's "dynamite."

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I can take this
dynamite paper plane

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
and use it to save everyone!

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
[KINRO] If someone got
caught in that blast,

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
they'd be gone in an instant!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
Human strength is just
pathetic in comparison.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
That's the power of science.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:32.108 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
We made it just in time.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
Thanks for stalling 'em
for us, battle team.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
We never could've pulled
it off without you.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
The kingdom of science
has just acquired

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
the amazingly dynamic
power of dynamite!

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
It has the overall
blasting force

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
of ten billion megaton joules.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
Yeah? "Ten billion megatons,"
you say? That's a huge lie.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
Shh! That's not important.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
Let me take this
negotiation, Senku.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
You always start by just
urting-blay out the facts.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
Huh? "Megatons"?
"Dynamite"? In this age?

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
They'll never be able to hit us

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
with little paper
planes, though.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:11.648 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They don't have a chance.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] We've got something more
accurate than paper planes.

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
How about dynamite arrows?

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Ukyo!

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
Seems the tide has turned.
The war's over, folks.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
That's it! The end!

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
[MEN grunt]

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Magnificent.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50% align:center
Ha-ha! Yes, we won!

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
The war's actually over!

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
We may have won the battle,

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
but the war's not
over quite yet.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
The grunts and underlings
have been dealt with,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
but they weren't the
only thing in our way.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
There are big problems
looming overhead.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
I'm sure Tsukasa and Senku

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
must've had that
same realization.

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
What happens next?
That's an onundrum-cay.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] If I block it or smack
it down, it'll still explode.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
And there's no way to
dodge the large blast.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
Yes. We can't avoid this
new weapon of yours.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
But still, an explosion would
mean collateral damage.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
Your own villagers
would get hurt.

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
Senku, it's clear you
can't abandon people.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
And you'd never
sacrifice yourself.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
Well, well, kinda looks like
both of us are stuck, huh?

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
It's a classic
stalemate situation.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
Obviously, this is all going
according to your design.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
Which means, Senku,
your objective is...

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
Yep, to negotiate. Sound good?

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
Gen, you said you
first met Tsukasa

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
on the set of some kind
of television special.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yeah, that's exactly
what happened.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.920 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] The whole thing
doesn't really add up, does it?

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
This guy could have
anything he wanted,

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
but his big goal
in the stone world

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
is building a society free
from the rich and corrupt,

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
turning away from established
powers or whatever.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
All these lofty goals.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
That's the kinda man
Shishio Tsukasa really is.

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
But in the old world,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.356 position:50% align:center
he did all those big-time
fights and TV appearances,

00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
raking in a ton of money.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.652 position:50% align:center
He even had this public persona:

00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
"The strongest primate
high schooler."

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, it just
doesn't feel like his style.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.993 position:50% align:center
A fair point.

00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
Making a ton of
money seemed like

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
such an obvious and
natural thing to want

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
that I never had a second
thought about it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
You needed the money for what,
exactly? Or rather, for whom?

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
She's still alive, isn't she?
I'm talking about your sister.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.726 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
Clinically, she's brain-dead.

00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
There's no possibility
that little Mirai

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
will ever regain consciousness.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.398 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
[TV AUDIENCE laughing]

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
I understand. But still--

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
[REPORTERS chattering]

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Hey, Mirai. I'm back.

00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:00.270 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'll protect you.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
It may take years,
or even decades,

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
but someday, I promise you.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
We might be able to heal her.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
Because the revival fluid has
a residual healing effect.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
I can't promise it'll work,

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
but it's the only
chance she's got.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
That's right, Tsukasa!

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
And don't forget
that we were able

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
to fix Senku's neck
after you broke it!

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] By the way,
as for that revival fluid--

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! We just happen to
have control of all of it!

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Scumbag.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
Total scumbag.

00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
So what are your terms, then?

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
The terms are pretty
simple, really.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best to
revive your sister.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
And in exchange,
I'm asking for a cease-fire.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] And why should
I believe this isn't

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
a bunch of lies?

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
All you have is my word.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
I never lie about science.
Is that not enough?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
No, that's plenty. It's enough.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
[NIKKI] Wow. I never even
knew you had a sister.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] All that time,
you did everything for her.

00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
Thing I don't understand is,

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.120 position:50% align:center
why would a good guy
break the statues?

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
That's the biggest jerk move.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
"The biggest jerk move."

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
You're not wrong
about that, Taiju.

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
I guess you can be
pretty unt-blay

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
when you feel the need, huh?

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
The way you wanted to go about

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
"purifying humanity"
was really horrible.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.598 position:50% align:center
Horrible, huh?

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
Well, you may be
right about that.

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
But what would
you all have done?

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.901 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] If you were suddenly
reborn in a stone world

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
with practically
nobody else around,

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.367 position:50% align:center
and you found out there
was this revival fluid...

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
A primitive world can't sustain
a large number of people.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
There's no guarantee we can make
unlimited revival fluid, anyway.

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Well, Ukyo, who would
you have chosen?

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] I had to pick and
choose lives out of necessity.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
It's a scary thing
to have to do.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
I've always believed
playing God was a sin.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
I decided to carry
that sin myself.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
It was the only way
to build a new world.

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
That's why I did it.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
My goals haven't changed.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
What's more, they
won't in the future.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:47.247 position:50% align:center
For that reason, Senku...
this is just a cease-fire.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
Tch. That's fine with me.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
The hospital's around here.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
At least, it used to be.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Looks like some of these folks
ended up drifting a ways away.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
I guess we just need to
dig 'em all up then, huh?

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
We can mine 'em
out with dynamite.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
No, that's a really bad idea!

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.520 position:50% align:center
Won't that just destroy
them in the process?

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
Ah, don't worry. It's only to
break up the hard bedrock.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
And if a couple of 'em happen
to get blown up by accident,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.986 position:50% align:center
oh, well!

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
We'll just glue 'em back
together, won't we?

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.781 position:50% align:center
Um, and who do you
think will be the one

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
to do all that painstaking
work, Senku?

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
Please, don't!

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
There's some debate

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
on why Alfred Nobel
invented dynamite.

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
Was it intended for warfare,

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.715 position:50% align:center
or for mining and
civil engineering?

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center
So which one was it?

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
How would I know?

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
And why should I care about what
some old fart was feeling? Yuck.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
The only thing I can
tell you for sure

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
is that he used
the money he made

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:54.064 position:50% align:center
from the destructive
power of dynamite

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
to hype up science by
establishing the Nobel Prize.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
And here we are,

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
using that same destructive
power of dynamite.

00:22:04.741 --> 00:22:09.412 position:50% align:center
