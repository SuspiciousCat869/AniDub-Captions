Way to go, boy!

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
Science is so incredible!

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center

Yeah, about that.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
I had some help from
Taiju and the others.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
They slipped me this battery.

do something that clever.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
Ah, so it was Yuzuriha!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
That makes sense, logically.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
Although Yuzuriha should be too
busy with her secret mission.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
She's not the type to get
distracted from the task at hand

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.547 position:50% align:center
She's got a "secret mission?"

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
You mean the infiltration?

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.886 position:50% align:center

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy that we won't
have to just throw away

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.405 position:50% align:center
our adorable little
Steam Gorilla now!

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Our odds are ten billion
times better with this tank.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.744 position:50% align:center
Now we can storm the enemy
on the final battlefield.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.123 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.374 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about the battle

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.835 position:50% align:center
to take control of
the miracle cave.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.421 position:50% align:center
Whoever has access to the
nitric acid brewing in there

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
can make revival fluid
and whip up some gunpowder.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.885 position:50% align:center
That means, if we're able to
take it away from their side...

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50% align:center
...then Tsukasa won't be
able to get more people!

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, and that also means

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50% align:center
we get our hands on the
ultimate weapon of science!

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Like I said before,

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.188 position:50% align:center
the condition for a kingdom
of science victory

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.607 position:50% align:center
is ridiculously simple.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.318 position:50% align:center
We're not looking to
annihilate the enemy.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50% align:center
All we wanna do is capture the
cave with the miracle fluid.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
You know, Tsukasa's gonna
throw his whole army at us.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
We can pull this off.
With sorcery.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.747 position:50% align:center
I mean, with our science stuff!

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA] But they've gotta have
around a hundred people or so.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
[KINRO] Meanwhile we've only
got about a dozen fighters.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.712 position:50% align:center
We're totally outnumbered.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
For now.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
But that's why Taiju and the
others are working so hard.

[ALL gasp, chuckle]

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
Which means that the rest of it

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
is up to the
mentalist's big mouth.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.601 position:50% align:center
We'll bring 'em all
over to our side.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.145 position:50% align:center
Quite the responsibility.

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
Be honest with me.

that it doesn't reach

Ukyo's uper-say sensitive ears.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center

You know what, forget the rope.

He was at the miracle cave,

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
just scouting it
out all by himself.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
That puts the Gen versus Ukyo
showdown at one to one so far.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
At this point,
it's stupidly obvious

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
who slipped Chrome the battery.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
It had to be you, that right?

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Not bad.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
You sure do catch on
quickly, don't you?

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
If I hadn't gotten involved,
you'd've come to save him,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
and both of you would be dead.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:06.022 position:50% align:center
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not really on your side.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't think so.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
If that were the case,

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
then you never would've
captured Chrome.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
I guess you could say...

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.865 position:50% align:center
...I'm assessing the situation.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
I want to know what kind
of people you really are.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
I saw what you're up to,
the unbelievable secret mission

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
your friend is
trying to pull off.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
[MEN chattering]

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
Gonna go make some clothes.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
That's odd.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.854 position:50% align:center
I hear something
rattling in the bag.

00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
Stone fragments.
And lots of 'em.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
If she's sewing,
why would she need those?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
It doesn't add up.

00:10:58.241 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
[UKYO gasps]

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA]
And done.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
She's finished that quickly?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
That's weird.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.626 position:50% align:center
Everybody thinks she's pulling
all-nighters in here,

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
sewing away.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] But if that's
just some kind of act,

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
what the heck is she doing
with the rest of her time?

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA] Looks like today's is
even more advanced than usual.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
That's okay. I'm actually
kinda used to this.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
Hold on. Those rocks are--

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
The statues' surfaces
are too weathered

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
to revert to living cells.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
That's why when you're revived,

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
you break through
a thin layer of rock.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
In other words, if the statues
that Tsukasa's destroyed

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
are reassembled before they have
time to erode and break down,

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
then just maybe...

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
It's almost impossible
to believe...

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
...but if my hunch is right...

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
It's insane.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
Even with things as far
gone as they are now...

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
...your people are still
trying to save humanity

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
with the power of science.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[MAN F] I'm so sorry,
but that primitive guy

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
melted through the
rope and got out!

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
I dunno how it
happened. I swear!

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
Don't worry yourself
too much about Chrome.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.832 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be helped.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
Though... I would like to
know what became of Yo.

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Well, he, uh...

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
[YO]
Oh, man. I let Chrome get away!

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center
It's over for me, guys.
I am so screwed!

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.560 position:50% align:center
This is my last order,
so listen close.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
A subordinate does what
their superior tells 'em,

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
so responsibility goes up
the ladder. Understand?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
I'm talkin' 'bout me.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
[YO chuckles]

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
I let Chrome escape, okay?

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
Tell them that it
was all my fault.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
And then tell 'em, "Yo totally
fell into the waterfall!

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
That dude is dead!"

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
I am outta here, man!
Time for another reset! See ya!

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.063 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Sounds crazy, but even
the ones that were smashed.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
If we put them together
like 3D puzzles,

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:20.318 position:50% align:center
there's a chance we
could save them.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
Ten billion points
for finding out.

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
So now what, Ukyo? You gonna
rat me out to Tsukasa?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
No.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm open
to cooperating

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
with you and your team, Senku.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.711 position:50% align:center
But I do have one condition.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Ukyo and his
uper-say sensitive ears

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
would be an owerful-pay ally
to have on our side, but...

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center
A condition, eh?
Perhaps I should take over.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Negotiation is a
mentalist's specialty.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Let's not beat around
the bush, okay?

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
Get straight to the point.
Just tell me your condition.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
What the heck are
you doing, Senku?

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
That's a errible-tay
approach to negotiation!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center
[UKYO chuckles]

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
Okay, fine.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
My condition is
pretty cut-and-dry.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
Nobody dies.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:16.541 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'm having a hell of
a time trying get a read

00:15:16.624 --> 00:15:18.877 position:50% align:center
on who you really are, Ukyo.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
You're either some kinda
sunshine and rainbows idealist--

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Ha, an "idealist"?
That's not quite it.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
I'm the biggest coward there is.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
Aren't you... Shishio Tsukasa?

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you. Yeah.

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
Welcome. My reporter friend
has told me about you.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
The former submarine sonar
operator, Saionji Ukyo.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
You'd made quite
a name for yourself.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center
Known for "exceptional hearing
and rational decision-making."

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Ukyo, I need your
help in order to build

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
a beautiful stone world--
better than the old one.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] The first time I saw
Tsukasa destroy a statue,

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.431 position:50% align:center
it made me sad and angry.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
I thought, "What gives you
the right to do that?"

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
Still, I wanted to keep those

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
who had been revived
from killing each other.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
I decided to turn a blind eye
to Tsukasa's destruction.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
"They're just statues.
Inanimate objects.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.409 position:50% align:center
Not reviving them isn't
actually murder."

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
That's how I tried to convince
myself it was okay.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
I know that I'm
a hopeless coward.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
But... the truth is...

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.261 position:50% align:center
...I can't take it anymore.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
I can't bear to see
anyone else die.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.726 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the last
shred of humanity

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
we can hold onto in
this crazy world?

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] If you make a promise
of zero casualties,

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
I'll cooperate with you.

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
But if even one person
dies, then...

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
[SENKU laughs]

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
Works for me! Count us in!

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
It's perfect, really!

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.162 position:50% align:center
From the very beginning,

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
we said we'd do this without
spilling a drop of blood.

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
Now that's just a requirement
instead of an ideal.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
That's gonna be a tough
promise with this battle!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.465 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU]
Huh?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
Well, after this, there's
one thing I'm sure of now.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Huh?

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] When Hyoga
attacked your village,

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
he reported something
back to us.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
He said our men were killed
by what you did to them.

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
He lied. It couldn't
have been your doing.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
It was Hyoga.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa and Hyoga
are both at the top,

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
but they're totally
different creatures.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
I can't sit on the
fence any longer.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.123 position:50% align:center
There's going to be bloodshed
between those two, I know it.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] These footprints
are way too neat.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
It looks like the
place was cleaned up,

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
and then someone stamped
in these footprints

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
to hide something.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
Were there several
people gathered here?

00:18:22.227 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] I've heard that a few of
our men had come to the grave.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
Were you here?

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
No.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
But I've come now to pay
my respects to the late Yo.

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
I want him to return
back to the earth.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
Gozan. Yuki. Ren. Akashi.
Kyoichiro. Morito.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
He deserves to rest
in peace with them.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Gozan? Yuki? Who are they?

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
They're our fallen brothers.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
Those killed by poison gas
in the village raid.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Ah.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] I'd like to bury
what we have left of Yo

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.150 position:50% align:center
next to his comrades.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
Time to get excited, you guys,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
because our awesome papercraft
tank is rarin' to go!

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.247 position:50% align:center
So does this cannon
actually fire?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
We don't have gunpowder.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be usin'
a leather rupture disk.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
A rup-- A what?

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:34.090 position:50% align:center
A burst diaphragm.
It explodes when it's expanded.

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
We'll zap some water inside
the tank with electricity,

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
which'll make it boil.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
And when the oxygen
and hydrogen gas

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
that's released completely
overfills the disk... blammo!

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see! Even I can
understand how that one works.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
If it blows up, that means
we can only use it once!

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but once will be enough.

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] As soon as we
roll up in this tank,

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
the odds are ten billion
to one those modern people

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
are gonna lose
the will to fight.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
Ahh.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
That'll scare them
into giving up.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
If we're gonna do this
with no casualties,

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
that initial shot has
to seal the deal.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.796 position:50% align:center
We'll be relying
on shock and awe!

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Control of the miracle
cave is at stake here.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
Once it starts, we've only
got a few seconds to finish.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
We'll throw everything the
kingdom of science has at 'em!

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:26.351 position:50% align:center
So we need him, the toughest
guy that I've ever known.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
His crazy stamina is like a
cheat code from mother nature.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
I've never met you before,

00:20:41.116 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
and yet, I already
know who you are.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Taiju.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
Senku!

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
Now, the kingdom of
science is playing

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
with a stacked deck of cards.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
It's the beginning
of the final battle

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50% align:center
against the Tsukasa empire.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
So get excited, you guys.

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Hm?

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I've done some
reading on human behavior.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.391 position:50% align:center
According to Harvard
psychologist

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.310 position:50% align:center
Shawn Achor's research,

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
a human impulse lasts about 20
seconds and no longer than that.

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
So that means the enemy will
only have the instinct to panic

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.695 position:50% align:center
and run away for the first
20 seconds of our raid,

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
and then who knows
what'll happen?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:03.823 position:50% align:center
After that time's up,

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
some of them may decide
to start fighting back!

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:09.037 position:50% align:center
And if we do fight,
then people will die!

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.748 position:50% align:center
Everybody, get ready!

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:16.461 position:50% align:center
These next 20 seconds will
decide the future of humanity!
