[chuckles]

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:30.632 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
I'm so nostalgic

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
I could just about
cry my eyes out.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
Is that--?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.064 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU] That's where
Senku and I woke up,

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:48.483 position:50% align:center
and where everything started.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:52.070 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU]
The miracle cave.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.407 position:50% align:center
The place you told us about,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
where we get the stuff
from bat guano.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.703 position:50% align:center
Our nitric acid.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA] Nitric acid
is used for everything--

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.505 position:50% align:center
from breathing life into the
statues to making gunpowder,

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:15.468 position:50% align:center
which can destroy anything
in this primitive world.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.514 position:50% align:center
It's a miracle water that can
bring both life and death.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50% align:center
Which is why Tsukasa has
so many people guarding it.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Yo. I won't let
your death be in vain.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.698 position:50% align:center
Senku's objective
is the miracle cave.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.909 position:50% align:center
We'll stop them in the names
of Yo and the other fallen,

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
and build a new, ideal world.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.206 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Yes.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
--[TSUKASA] Huh?
--[HYOGA] Hm?

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.838 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.226 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa and Hyoga are at the
grave. It's pretty far away.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
Just the kinda thing
I was hoping to hear.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
It's almost game time, everyone.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
One blast of this
tank's fake cannon

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
and any modern person's morale

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
will immediately sink
ten billion percent.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
But don't forget that we're
on a time limit here.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
The enemy will only panic and
have the instinct to run away

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
for the first 20 seconds or so.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
After that, the enemy will come
to their senses and retaliate.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
And if we fight,
people will die.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
Uh, so 20 seconds in,
we're killing each other?

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA laughs]

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.388 position:50% align:center
That's when the real fun begins,
and we murder 'em all!

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
[KINRO]
No. Nobody dies.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
Those are the terms
of our alliance.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
The rules are the rules.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.897 position:50% align:center
Break them and who
knows what'll happen.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
[SENKU laughs]

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
In other words, our victory
conditions are tough.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.279 position:50% align:center
We're conquering
the miracle cave

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
with our science-
powered blitzkrieg--

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.909 position:50% align:center
without killing a single person.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
All right then.
Let's get this started!

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
Okay, Steam Gorilla... Move out!

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.678 position:50% align:center
Everybody, get ready!

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
These next 20 seconds

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
will decide the future
of humanity!

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.358 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS yelling]

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.435 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Hidden inside our little missile

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
is a glass jar full
of sulfuric acid.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
When the glass breaks,

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
the acid will mix with
the surrounding fuel

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.486 position:50% align:center
made from alcohol and coal ash.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
It'll at least
look like a giant

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
Hollywood-budget explosion.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
[MEN yell]

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa's ready.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
He's been expecting us to
attack with a steam engine.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
And the miracle cave should be

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
an itical-cray
facility to protect.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
I bet the way there's full of
all sorts of anti-vehicle traps.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
Oh, definitely.
Ten billion percent.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.519 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
So, Senku, how about a detour?

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.104 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
No way. Charge!

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
This is bad!

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.901 position:50% align:center
[yelping]

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Go!

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[MAN E]
What is that? Wait!

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
[MAN K]
No way, is that--?

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
[MAN M]
A tank?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
We're screwed!

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
They're smashing right
through all our traps!

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA laughs]

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
I could get used to
these tank things!

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
It's no surprise you
like them, Magma.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
We busted through their traps.
That's saved us precious time!

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.135 position:50% align:center
Let's go, everyone!
Frontal assault!

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
Crap! It's an ambush!

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
Stop 'em!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] The opening
encounter's the most crucial.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
Hope the panicked grunts
can't pull off a counterattack.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
[KINRO]
Killing's against the rules.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
But how do we handle them
with that kind of limitation?

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
[MEN chuckle]

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
Taiju!

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That broke my spear!

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
It's a carbon shield.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.293 position:50% align:center
What'd you say? Carbon?

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
You have that in
the stone world?

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, you guys!

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
You can count on me
to stop all the attacks

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.385 position:50% align:center
at the head of the pack!

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
[MAN F] You couldn't even stop
the one that hit your head!

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
[MAN K]
Man, that dude is tough.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Now listen here!

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
Hasn't anyone ever told you
that hitting people is wrong?

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
[MAN F] Is he really saying that
in the middle of a battle?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.483 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU yells]

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Their weapons! Knock 'em away!

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
Tie up every last one!

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
Follow Kohaku!

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.498 position:50% align:center

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
[MAN M]
The tank's finally down.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.724 position:50% align:center
All right! The traps
worked after all!

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.267 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
Eriously-say.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:25.357 position:50% align:center
Honestly, we lasted
longer than I expected.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
All right, Magma. You're up.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA]
Hmph.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
Who said you could boss
me around like that?

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
You could at least say
"please" next time.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center

What is that?

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[MAN G]
A copper plate?

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
[MAN M]
Is it another shield?

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
It's one of our science
surprise gadgets.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center
A kind of modified sonic bomb.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
We're harnessing all the
sound of a detonation

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
with a parabola and
shooting it at the enemy.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center
Time for ear plugs!

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center

This is the exact opposite
of what Tsukasa said to do.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.977 position:50% align:center
In case of an ambush,
calmly retreat and regroup.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
Is that so hard?

[MINAMI]
Oh, well,

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
it's a good chance to use
my journalistic skills.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
I'll go report to Tsukasa
and tell him what's going on.

woman. Stay here by my side."

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
We actually conquered it!

[VILLAGERS cheering]

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.218 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time.

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU] So, going forward,
the two of us will be spies

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
inside the Tsukasa empire,

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
and you'll be recruiting
for the rebel science army.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
We'll each be fighting
our own battles.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.611 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
That's the idea.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.821 position:50% align:center
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
Better get going
before we start to cry.

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.101 position:50% align:center
It's been a whole year

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
since we parted ways to fight
this battle, to make it here.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU yells]

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Finally! We finally
have it back!

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
A bucket of bat guano turned
nitric acid. It's ours!

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.034 position:50% align:center
The miracle water!

00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
Now that we got a hold
of this, we're set!

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
We can make revival
fluid and gunpowder!

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.004 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Hey, what are you doing, Senku?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
We won, get excited!

He's always been the type

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.634 position:50% align:center
to keep a cool head, ya know?

00:14:44.718 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
It takes a minute
before he celebrates.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.221 position:50% align:center
Hey, Senku!

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I'd love nothing more

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
than a big victory party
right about now,

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
but we don't have the
time to waste on that.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
We're gonna start
making gunpowder.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.983 position:50% align:center
He's right, and that's bad!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
We need to get ready before
Tsukasa and the rest of his crew

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
catch on and find us here!

Sulfur and charcoal!

It's my instant
gunpowder starter kit.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.580 position:50% align:center
All you gotta do
is add nitric acid

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
and you're ready to
make things go boom.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
So well epared-pray.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center

They're fast, but
not that fast. How?

guys would be hard enough.

too much for us alone.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
already figured this
out instinctively.

But any hope the kingdom
of science had of winning

Yo, Tsukasa.

here so quickly

Yes, it was a close one.

this war has just been won.

have lost, Senku.

But I have a proposition.
If you would agree t--

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, you don't have
to spell it out for me.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
You'll let all these
fine people live,

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center

man has to die, right?

just like before.

all gross and tear-stained,
you big oaf.

Go pluck your eyeballs
out and wash 'em.

Remember, Taiju?

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
You didn't make it in time
back then. I was on my own.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
But look around you.
This is way different.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.002 position:50% align:center
We've got tons of allies here.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center

[KOHAKU]
Yeah.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Got that right, Senku.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.516 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. You've got another
science man right here.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.602 position:50% align:center
[KINRO]
We're with you.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
You've said from the very
beginning that no one dies.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
And rules are rules.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
It may be tough, but we
trained hard for this,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
and we're not about
to give up now.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
Yes. There's no doubt
that Senku's our leader.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
But he's also our friend.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
So all we gotta do is take down
these two? Should be easy.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
You guys are a little too
passionate for my taste.

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
But I guess if Senku
were to lose now,

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't get to drink
my cola anymore.

[TAIJU laughs]

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
This is nothing like last time.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.731 position:50% align:center
Senku. Forgive me.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Hah.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
Hey, long-haired man,
it's been a while, huh?

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.950 position:50% align:center
Not too friendly, are you?

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with "Hello," or, I
don't know, "Nice to meet you"?

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
You wanted a nicer greeting.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
It's a bit overdue,
but allow me to give you one.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] Nice to meet you.
We are the kingdom of science.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
Do you have some kind
of plan? Kohaku!

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Of course not! Obviously.

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
But we need to protect
the miracle water.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
This is siege warfare.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
If we can buy even a little
bit of time, then...

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
Our scientists can do it.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
I know they'll figure something
out and find a way to win!

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, but
in case you forgot,

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.952 position:50% align:center
we're out of
chemicals and stuff!

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.620 position:50% align:center
There's no way!

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center

Run, scientist!

They'll be dying for nothing.

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center

brain-dead barbarians after all.
