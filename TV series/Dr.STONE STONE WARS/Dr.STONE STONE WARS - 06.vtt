All right!

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.833 align:middle
It's time to get our mission to
save Chrome into full swing.

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.917 align:middle
Our plan is simple.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.333 align:middle
Here goes: First, we use the
powered-up Steam Gorilla

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.917 align:middle
to break down Chrome's
bamboo prison.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.083 align:middle
Then, we run.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:22.833 align:middle
That's all.

[OTHERS groan]

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.375 align:middle
That is pretty
simple, all right.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:29.792 align:middle
Indeed. But it needs to be
quick, before they find out.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.208 align:middle
And our precious Steam Gorilla's
meant for one-time-use.

00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle
Senku doesn't have much
ouble-tray letting go of things.

[KASEKI crying]

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle
We can't trash our adorable
little Steam Gorilla!

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.375 align:middle
We don't have that
much time, though.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.708 align:middle
It's Chrome, you know.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.083 align:middle
He's gonna start runnin'
his mouth before too long.

I'm a scientist!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.583 align:middle
Truth is, we may already
be too late on that.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.583 align:middle
Yeah, that's a very good point.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.792 align:middle
So let's get ready
to set out ASAP!

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle

[TSUKASA] Senku's not the
type to abandon his friends.

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:12.917 align:middle
I have no doubt
he'll use science

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.708 align:middle
to develop a way to save Chrome.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle
Maybe even build a steam
engine to stage an assault.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle
That's why we'll all be
counting on your strength.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.792 align:middle
You need my strength?

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.583 align:middle
I interviewed you back
in the pre-stone days,

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.583 align:middle
at the police martial
arts tourney?

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.583 align:middle
You completely aced
the baton category.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.167 align:middle
You were a crazy police
officer who's crazy strong.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.875 align:middle
So, I'm asking you
to oversee the prison

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle
and all traps surrounding it.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle
Well, Yo?

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle
You bet, yo!

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:49.042 align:middle
Oh, yeah! Just leave
everything to Yo!

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:52.167 align:middle
I can use the prisoner as bait
to take down this Senku guy

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.542 align:middle

of baddies, too!

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.667 align:middle
Ahh.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.708 align:middle
[CHROME] I'll bust myself out
before Senku gets here!

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.833 align:middle
With the power of science!

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:06.792 align:middle
I got this, 'cause I'm Chrome,

Hmm...

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:46.667 align:middle
How the hell am I gonna
do this, though?

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.417 align:middle
Tsukasa's guys took away all
the science stuff I had on me

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle

[CHROME]
No, that's never gonna work.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle
Now, what would Senku
do in this situation?

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.625 align:middle
I gotta formulate
an escape plan.

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.042 align:middle

[YO] What'd ya expect me to do,
give ya a slap on the wrist?

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.833 align:middle
You ruined the trap.

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle
And the guilty ones always
gotta pay for their crimes.

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle
[YO] But that's enough.
We're good, okay?

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:40.958 align:middle
Yeah. I'm sorry, Yo.

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:44.292 align:middle
No need to apologize,
I said, "We're good."

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.542 align:middle
In fact, if any of
these boneheads

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:51.167 align:middle
try to give you grief about it,

00:19:33.583 --> 00:19:36.792 align:middle
and hoped you'd be able to
see me with the telescope.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle
Another excellent job by
the Great Detective Suika.

00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.042 align:middle
[SUIKA giggles]

00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:42.375 align:middle
But I'm curious.

00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:44.667 align:middle
How did you manage to break
through the cell bars?

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle
Oh, that?

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:49.208 align:middle
With my awesome science.
It was like seriously bad.

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:50.667 align:middle
I made that melty chemical stuff

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.042 align:middle
with some salt water
and a battery.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.917 align:middle
Sodium hydroxide, right?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.167 align:middle
[VILLAGER A]
Whoa!

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.208 align:middle
[VILLAGER B]
That's awesome!

00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:59.875 align:middle
It's actually sodium
hypochlorite.

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.208 align:middle
You're close.

00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:03.625 align:middle
But that's what you must've
made in there instead,

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:06.458 align:middle
since you didn't have any kind
of membrane in the salt water.

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:08.917 align:middle
It's what folks in my
day called "bleach."

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle
[GEN]
Powers up your cleaning!

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.375 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.708 align:middle
[SENKU]
It's a perfectly useful base.

00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:16.792 align:middle
Great idea to use it, too.

00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.917 align:middle
It melted right through all
the cellulose in the weeds

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.542 align:middle
they made the rope from.

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:24.417 align:middle
Can't think of a better way to
break out of a bamboo prison.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.875 align:middle
Awesome job, Chrome.
I'll give ya ten billion points!

00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.333 align:middle
Heh.

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:33.292 align:middle
Hang on, speaking of sodium
hydroxide, wasn't that...?

00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:34.292 align:middle
Oh, yeah.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:36.375 align:middle
While you were
doing all of that,

00:20:36.458 --> 00:20:38.125 align:middle
we were using an
alkaline solution

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:40.875 align:middle
to melt down cellulose
for making paper.

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.083 align:middle
Ha! That's amazing.

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.208 align:middle
So Senku and Chrome
were basically using

00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:46.833 align:middle
the same type of science.

00:20:46.917 --> 00:20:48.125 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:51.958 align:middle
Hey, Chrome. You're bleeding.

00:20:58.083 --> 00:20:59.292 align:middle
[SUIKA gasping]

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:02.542 align:middle
Oh, no. That's like
what happened to me!

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.583 align:middle
Poor Chrome must've caught
pneumonia while he was in there!

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:06.625 align:middle
[VILLAGER A]
It's terrible.

00:21:06.708 --> 00:21:08.042 align:middle
[VILLAGER B]
Chrome!

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:12.958 align:middle
Just kidding!

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:15.542 align:middle
I don't understand? You're okay?

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.167 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.292 align:middle
[SENKU]
You have a lot of plants, too.

00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle
I try them on myself.

00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:23.208 align:middle
And I keep the ones
I think are good.

00:21:23.292 --> 00:21:24.625 align:middle
[SENKU laughs]

00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:26.042 align:middle
Did you really use fake blood

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:27.958 align:middle
to make those guys
stop chasing you?

00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:32.125 align:middle
You bet! I knew Professor
Senku would understand.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.042 align:middle
[CHROME]
Chew up some sorrel...

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.333 align:middle
[CHROME]
And mix in a little shiso...

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:43.083 align:middle
[CHROME]
And boom, fake blood!

00:21:43.167 --> 00:21:44.542 align:middle
[SENKU laughs]

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:45.917 align:middle
That's awesome!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.292 align:middle
'Course Shiso turns red

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle
mixed with the oxalic
acid from sorrel.

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:53.208 align:middle
Uh-huh! My science
is from experience.

00:21:53.292 --> 00:21:57.333 align:middle
Not bad at all, Chrome.
You're a real science user.

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:58.458 align:middle
[CHROME]
Yeah!

00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:03.083 align:middle
[VILLAGERS laughing]

00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:07.583 align:middle
I'm so happy that he doesn't
actually have pneumonia!

00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:10.417 align:middle
This red water smells
kinda familiar to me.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.333 align:middle
It's just like plums
pickled in shiso.

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:21.583 align:middle
This stuff's just <i>umeboshi</i> ?
Damn that monkey!
