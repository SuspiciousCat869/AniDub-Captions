[HOMURA]
Hyoga.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
Hey, Senku. You okay?

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Yeah, actually.
Ten billion percent okay.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Probably
wouldn't be saying that

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
if it were the first time
I'd been speared.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kinro.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
That training you put me
through really paid off.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA laughs]

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.969 position:50% align:center
Well, now that the fighting
part's outta the way,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
let's murder this Hyoga bastard.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Killing people is wrong,
and we don't do that!

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
Why's that always your
first plan of action?

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.772 position:50% align:center
But still, how long are we
gonna keep 'em captive?

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.023 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
That's easy. Until we have
society back up and running.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.909 position:50% align:center
Once we have a
scientific civilization,

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
Hyoga won't be the
strongest anything.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
People can put him on trial
or whatever they need to do.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
Heh. I don't have a millimeter
of interest in that.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
I'm just a scientist.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe...
but finally... it's over.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Are you making a joke, or what?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.893 position:50% align:center
That's backwards.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.021 position:50% align:center
Right now, we're finally
getting started.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.774 position:50% align:center
We've got all these people
to work together with us

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
to build a real
kingdom of science.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.822 position:50% align:center
We're starting from square
one in this stone world,

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.366 position:50% align:center
so I hope you're excited.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
[MAN F]
What the hell's all this?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
Quit just standin'
around, would ya?

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
We've got a lotta work to do!

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
Um.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] We're building
science facilities!

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be awesome!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
[KASEKI] Woo-hoo!
To forge iron and blow glass!

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.274 position:50% align:center
This power generator
isn't gonna build itself!

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
If any of you have
the fuzzy sickness,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
some glasses will save you.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
In the kingdom of science,
we even have ramen!

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA sighs]

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
I think that one was
the last piece of 'im.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA] The poor guy was
broken into so many parts.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
[RURI]
Yeah, I'm worried.

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
Will the regeneration
fix him up good as new?

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.463 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course it will.
'Least, I think so.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
Per Senku's hypothesis,
it should work

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
if the interior surfaces
aren't too weathered.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
Huh? But what if he's
wrong about that?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
Then when we pour the revival
fluid on him, he'll go splat!

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
Blood and gore all over!

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA whimpers]

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
It really worked!

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
The guy actually
came back to life!

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
[MANGAKA screams]

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:37.902 position:50% align:center
[MANGAKA]
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
My deadline!
How long was I asleep?

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
Few thousand years.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
No way! That means my
deadline's totally shot!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Here ya go.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
We have everything a
manga artist would need.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
Do you know this guy
from the old world?

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
Nope, never met him.
But he's a manga artist.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
You remember what Senku
promised everyone, don't you?

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
He said he'd bring back
all the fun things

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
humanity has to offer.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
Art and entertainment,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.724 position:50% align:center
and the stuff that
made people happy.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
This is where it begins again.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
Our exciting scientific
civilization.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
[YO] Scientific civilization?
Entertainment?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
How long has it been?
Man! How did I miss all this?

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
Your boy Yo was only
gone for a minute!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
This is wild! I'm so jealous!

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
[YO]
Yo! 'Sup?!

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.539 position:50% align:center
I fell down a waterfall,
and got, like, amnesia,

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
but I'll all good now.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
I can help you move stuff, too.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Yo! He's seriously bad news.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
And he's probably the
one who let Homura go.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
Hey, if he's willing to
help, I say we let him.

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
Because we need it.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
The more the merrier.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
And we have a ton of statue
puzzles to put together.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
[YO] Sweet! So all my
crimes are cleared, huh?

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.396 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
What crimes?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
[NIKKI] Does that count
as a confession?

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how many pieces
we talkin' here?

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
Whatever you need,
Yo is on the ca-- Ah!

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
Are you freakin'
kiddin' me right now?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
You're really planning on
putting all these back together?

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Like, every single one?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
That's right! Every single one!

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
[YO]
Whoa! Just asking!

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] From there, it's a
straight shot past the lake.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
Not too far.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.635 position:50% align:center
That's enough talking
for now, Tsukasa.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
You need to get plenty of rest.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
I have to tell them
this before the end.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
The war's over,

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
and the kingdom of
science has won,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
so the statues
that I destroyed--

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
those people--were just
meaningless sacrifices.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.742 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry at all!

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
You need somebody to go do
grunt work, then I'm your man!

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
[TAIJU] All you gotta do is tell
me where the broken ones are

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
and I'll gather up
every last piece!

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] Tsukasa, do you actually
remember every single one?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50% align:center
Each statue that you've
broken since the beginning?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
'Course I do.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
I haven't forgotten them.
Not even for a single moment.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
Wonderful news.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
You did it, guys. We really won.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
And all our friends are safe?

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
Not a soul was
lost in the battle?

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so happy!

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] Yeah, nobody from
the village, at least.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
No.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
Not a single person's died!
It's just like we promised!

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
Senku's not gonna let him die!

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
[GEN] So what exactly are
you working on, Senku?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] We have a ton
of modern humans now.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
Some of them might even
recognize what I'm doing.

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Vinegar plus chlorine
with a dash of sulfur

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
gives us chloroacetate.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
Then throw in a little bit
of sodium hydroxide

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
and we get some
sodium chloroacetate.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
Get that to react
with sodium cyanide

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
made from blood and iron
to get cyanoacetic acid.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
No, this stuff's still
too ough-tay for everyone.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
[MEN]
No way!

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
In any case, after all
that's put together,

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.554 position:50% align:center
add alcohol to make
ethyl cyanoacetate,

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
throw in formaldehyde,

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
and that'll give you
the kind of superglue

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.892 position:50% align:center
that can seal up major wounds.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
You're saying... Tsukasa's still
got a chance? That'll save him?

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.193 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] We're just closing
the wound to buy time.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I'm not a magician.
I can't rebuild an organ.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
So this is the best I can do.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA] Just me and Hyoga.
Could be worse.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] You people are still
as brain-dead and soft as ever.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
You won't even bring
yourselves to execute a man

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
who killed his own commander.

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
And you truly expect
you'll be able

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
to run a kingdom in such a way?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
Ha. You think you
killed Tsukasa?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
Doesn't seem like you'll
be able to make that claim.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
How ridiculous.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
But I suppose the mediocre types
always count on miracles.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.821 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Miracles?

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
Senku doesn't believe in putting
his faith in that kinda stuff.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
He always follows
the path of science,

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.667 position:50% align:center
no matter what kind of
obstacles he may face.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
And there's no one in the world

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
who's stronger or
works harder than him.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
I've thought about it,

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.845 position:50% align:center
and there's just one
way to save you.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.688 position:50% align:center
You ready? We're gonna
re-petrify you, Tsukasa.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI screams]

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
Whoa! I'm sorry!

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI chuckles]

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
Oh, hello there, Mirai.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
They told me that
I needed to stay away,

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
but I was worried
about my brother,

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
so I had to sneak a peek.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
[KASEKI]
Hey! Yuzuriha! Over here!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.298 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] We have some
needlework to be done.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50% align:center
It's a job for a
crafts club member.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
[ALL chuckling]

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA] When you say
"needlework", you mean...?

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
Surgery? We obviously don't
have any anesthetic.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.898 position:50% align:center
Are you sure? Otally-tay?

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate
history's strongest primate.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
You don't need any anesthetic,
do you, Tsukasa?

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.242 position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI yelps]

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Mirai!

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:08.001 position:50% align:center
[KASEKI] Hmm. Well, she is still
only six years old, mentally.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] I know you're worried,
but it'll be okay.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
Senku's science is
always the real deal.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
He's honest about
what he can do.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
You can put your trust in him.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
If he's looking for a
way to save Tsukasa,

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
I know that he'll find it.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.987 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] No matter how
slim the odds might be,

00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.406 position:50% align:center
and no matter how
many years it takes,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
he will come through in the end.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
I know my own body, so I'm
aware of what's going on.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
The surgery was only
to buy some time.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
In a few days, I will
have died from sepsis.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
Yeah. The only way we can
save you is to petrify you.

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
Petrify him to save him?

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
We're gonna take advantage

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
of the regenerative effects
of coming out of petrification.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
That'll be what
ultimately heals him.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:15.985 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I understand
the rationale for it.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:19.280 position:50% align:center
But, Senku, can you
actually petrify him?

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Calm down.
You're like an eager little kid.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
We're gonna have to
figure that part out.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:29.624 position:50% align:center
Although we have no clue
how long that'll take.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
I do know there's a ten
billion percent chance

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
he'll be dead by then.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:39.092 position:50% align:center
So before that happens, Tsukasa,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
I'm going to have to kill
you with my own hands.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
What are... you saying?

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
I'm gonna freeze you to death.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
Or, more literally, cold sleep.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, we'll find
a way to petrify you.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
But I'm gonna bring you back,
no matter what it takes.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
That's the only way.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Put your trust in me... and die.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
'Course I trust you.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
'Cause if I gotta die,
I'd rather you kill me.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
It's only fair, Senku.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
I've killed you once before,
so I owe you one.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Oh, yeah,
you're totally right. Heh.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
That's perfect.
It'll be my revenge.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
So I've gotta kill ya.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
My precious little Steam Gorilla
got broken up in battle,

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
but now it's about to be reborn
as something super amazing!

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I only need two pistons
that we used for the engine.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
Okay, we're gonna have to
tear the cell phone apart.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
We're takin' all that
golden wire outta there!

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Look at
those cavemen go!

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
Shut up, will ya?

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
We're the one's who've
been living like cavemen

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
for all this time.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
Incredible. What are
you guys making, anyway?

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
Oh, a refrigerator.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
A re...

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
...fridger...

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
...ator?

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Well, more like a freezer.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50% align:center
A stone world refrigerator?

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
Yeah, typical modern
person's reaction.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
That's what I said
at first, too.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
But now, my only response
is to laugh at it.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
[GEN laughing]

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Chugga-chugga-chugga
go the two pumps.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.967 position:50% align:center
Pushing and pulling air through
the part with the gold wire.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.886 position:50% align:center
That action is gonna
transfer the heat away.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.347 position:50% align:center
Freezing stuff!

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
So bad!

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
I'm not entirely sure how it all
works, but it sounds awesome!

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Hold on a sec. Are
freezers really that simple?

00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Well, modern ones are
a little more complicated.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
I do know that things don't
spoil when they're frozen.

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
And at the end of all this,
there's a chance

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.533 position:50% align:center
we could come out with
a ten billion percent

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.745 position:50% align:center
perfect way to preserve
our food supply.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:15.081 position:50% align:center
The petri-beam!

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Add a splash of revival fluid,

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
and we can have all the fresh
sashimi we'd ever want.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Plus, the regeneration effect

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
will get rid of the germs
and bad bacteria, too.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
Does that mean we...

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
He's taking the world's
worst disaster

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.099 position:50% align:center
and finding a way
to make it useful.

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
This is so freakin' bad!

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
It's a whole new science!

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
Petrification rules!

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
[KINRO] Great for when
we don't catch much!

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I say if we can't
sustain seven billion people,

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
then let's try having
seven billion people

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
look for a way to
sustain seven billion.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
After all, that's the way
science does things.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Throw a freeze dryer in the mix

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.582 position:50% align:center
and we'll be unstoppable.

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] Yeah, this will solve
so many of our food issues!

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] Check it out!
We built a refrigerator!

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.218 position:50% align:center
[KASEKI] All right, you guys,
we gotta get outta here!

00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
But why? How come
we gotta go now?

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
If you were ever in the position

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
of having to put
your friend to death,

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
would you honestly
want an audience

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.978 position:50% align:center
just hanging around you?

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
They're both the chiefs
of their own tribes.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
They need to talk.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
And us being here'll
make that difficult.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
You said it's like cold sleep?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Only heard of that on
spaceships in science fiction.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Spaceships, huh?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
The Soyuz seats three.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
If you had to choose
out of everyone here,

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
who would you want riding
into space with you?

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Let's see...

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
You're asking me to make
a kind of shortlist

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
of the most capable people
here, or something?

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you talkin' about?
It's just a simple question.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
Here we are at the end
and you make small talk?

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] What's wrong with
making a little small talk?

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Well... Taiju. And...

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Senku,
but you might not be

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
physically fit enough
for exploring the planets.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:50.278 position:50% align:center
If I took someone from
the village, maybe Chrome.

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Yeah. I don't think
I'd need me there, either.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that chick with
the shells on her head?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
Why not her?

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
She's a journalist.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.999 position:50% align:center
She's been a crucial
source of information

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
for choosing who to revive.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Heh. I figured
you'd be into her.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
It'd make sense

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
for the "strongest
primate high schooler"

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
to have a thing for the
Marilyn Monroe type.

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
I didn't consider appearances

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
when picking people
to bring back.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.433 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
No, 'course not.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
By the way, why did you
choose the nickname

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
"the strongest primate
high schooler"?

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
I mean, did you just think
it sounded cool, or what?

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
To be honest,

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
I never actually thought
of myself that way.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:36.700 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] The world's
strongest primate for real

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
would have to be the
mega-macho mountain gorilla.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:43.832 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Yeah. Those
were tough, all right.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Huh?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] I've fought one
before. For some TV show.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Tch. You were a
total beast hunter, huh?

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
You fought a lion,
too, remember?

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA chuckles]

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
That thing tasted like crap

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
no matter how we
tried to cook it.

00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
You, Taiju, and I all made
the craziest faces eating it.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
You would've thought that
we'd lost some kinda dare.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.609 position:50% align:center
Only way we survived was
thanks to Taiju's idea

00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
of shoving it down with
a ton of mushrooms.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
That takes me back.

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Those days I
spent with you guys...

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:27.667 position:50% align:center
...they were great.

00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
So much fun.

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Sen... ku...

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.635 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
That reminds me.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:42.182 position:50% align:center
That poison mushroom Taiju ate,
it's called <i>amanita muscaria</i> .

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
If you eat a lot of 'em, they'll
totally make you hallucinate.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Ya know, funny thing is,
that particular one

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
looks a lot like the one Super
Mario eats to grow huge. Heh.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
But he actually doesn't
get any more powerful.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:58.656 position:50% align:center
You know why?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
It's because Mario only
believes that he's gotten huge

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
because he's hallucinating
hard off that mushroom.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
He's ten billion percent
tripping on it. Tripping balls.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
Ya know? Do you
know what I mean?

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
What do you think, Tsukasa?

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI]
You protected me, big brother.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
Watched over me and kept me
safe, for years and years.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
So I promise that I'm gonna
protect you this time.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.790 position:50% align:center
I'll be watching over
you every single day.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure that
nothing breaks.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Well, now that that's over with,

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
let's all get ready to ship out.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
We're starting immediately.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center
[GINRO]
Everybody's together?

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
[NIKKI] Tsukasa never
did anything like this.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
[YO]
Look at all these people.

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[SUIKA] I've never seen so
many in one place before!

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
All right, everybody,
listen up, please!

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.576 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
So about that mysterious-as-hell
petrification beam

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
that turned everyone into
stone 3700 years ago--

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why'd that happen, anyway?

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
It was lame, 'cause I was
takin' a leak in the street

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
when I got frozen.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
Wait, weren't you a cop?

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
If that really was an
attack of some sort

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
and it happened again, humanity
wouldn't be able to survive.

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
We're gonna figure it out.

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
We'll use science
to get to the bottom

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
of the whole
petrification thing.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
The information Byakuya
and the others left us

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
over thousands of years is
worth its weight in gold.

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
So we're heading to
the origin of the light:

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
The other side of the planet!

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:02.572 position:50% align:center
The other side, for real?

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
How can we travel that far?

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Aw, it'll be simple.

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:08.286 position:50% align:center
Neanderthals weren't advanced,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
and they made it all
the way across Eurasia.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.333 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but that took
tens of thousands of years.

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.460 position:50% align:center
And plus, those
people probably had

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.379 position:50% align:center
ridiculously powerful legs.

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.588 position:50% align:center
So?

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:20.548 position:50% align:center
We've got ridiculously
bad, powerful brains

00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:21.883 position:50% align:center
and tons of heart!

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.718 position:50% align:center
That'll get us to the other
side of the planet!

00:22:23.802 --> 00:22:25.887 position:50% align:center
We can't just walk
there, though, can we?

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.057 position:50% align:center
Of course not. We'll be
crossing the ocean.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.894 position:50% align:center
Which means, all of us will
be working together...

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:34.896 position:50% align:center
...to build a ship!

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
We're heading out into the world

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.735 position:50% align:center
to solve all its
greatest mysteries!

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:42.112 position:50% align:center
This voyage will
be the beginning

00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:44.614 position:50% align:center
of the stone world's
age of discovery!

00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:45.865 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:47.450 position:50% align:center
That's some bad shit!

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:49.786 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to help
in any way I can!

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.162 position:50% align:center
[MAGMA laughs]

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.289 position:50% align:center
I know we can build some boats.

00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:56.501 position:50% align:center
After all, we Ishigami Village
people live on the water!

00:22:56.584 --> 00:23:00.422 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I'm finally getting
to travel overseas!

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:01.756 position:50% align:center
That's your take?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
I guess you're right, though.

00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
Setting sail on a
worldwide adventure!

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:07.137 position:50% align:center
I know that everyone
is gonna have

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.139 position:50% align:center
the time of their lives
on the journey.

00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.140 position:50% align:center
For eal-ray!

00:23:10.223 --> 00:23:11.558 position:50% align:center
[UKYO chuckles]

00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:14.936 position:50% align:center
Amazing, he's really
serious about this plan.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.772 position:50% align:center
You know the kingdom of
science is always serious.

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.899 position:50% align:center
That's how they get things done.

00:23:21.192 --> 00:23:22.652 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
It's been two and a half years

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:25.238 position:50% align:center
since I woke up in
this stone world.

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:28.533 position:50% align:center
Heh. Nothin's been easy.

00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
Ha! We're finally
making real headway.

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:35.665 position:50% align:center
Following the road map
to humanity's future.

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:39.961 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Yeah. But we're
just getting started.

00:23:40.045 --> 00:23:42.297 position:50% align:center
The answer's almost
in our grasp.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.632 position:50% align:center
We'll know what really happened.

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:47.302 position:50% align:center
We'll repaint fantasy
with the vibrant colors

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:50.722 position:50% align:center
of truth and science.

00:23:50.805 --> 00:23:54.559 position:50% align:center
This is exhilarating.
Get excited!
