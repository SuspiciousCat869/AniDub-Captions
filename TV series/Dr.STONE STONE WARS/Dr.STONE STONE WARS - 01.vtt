00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.679 position:50% align:center
One day, a very long time ago,

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:15.098 position:50% align:center
there was a strange
flash of light.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
It appeared suddenly,
out of nowhere,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
covering the entire world.

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
[GEN]
In the blink of an eye,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
that wave of light turned every
man, woman, and child to stone.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, everything
began to collapse.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
Buildings decayed into rubble,

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
and over time, all traces of
civilization disappeared.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
What humanity had
spent millennia building

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
was gone forever.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
What a shame!

00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:02.228 position:50% align:center
However, there was one man
who refused to give up.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
Though he was petrified,
he never lost consciousness.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
He figured that
the date and time

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.570 position:50% align:center
were far too important
to lose track of,

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:14.824 position:50% align:center
so he stayed awake, counting
the seconds one by one.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.536 position:50% align:center
He's one ad-bay dude!

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
That man, you know him.
It's our friend, Senku!

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.836 position:50% align:center
And one summer day,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
thousands of years after
humankind was petrified,

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
Senku woke up, all alone.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
He found himself in an
empty, primitive Earth.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.724 position:50% align:center
Now, I probably
would've just died

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.352 position:50% align:center
from shock right then and there,

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
but since Senku is a brilliant
scientist with an amazing mind,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
he figured out how to make his
own food, clothing, and shelter.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:57.075 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Eventually, he
developed the miracle fluid

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
that could undo
the petrification.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.079 position:50% align:center
Senku is so awesome!

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
I want to be just like him!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center
Wow. You kids certainly
do love him, don't you?

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
I know, let's hear a word from
our antastic-fay leader.

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
He must have some
wisdom to share.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
Well, Senku?

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] What can I say,
that was absolutely riveting.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.434 position:50% align:center
I mean, how could I hope
to top all of that?

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.687 position:50% align:center
Your super stone world
foundation story was epic.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
Just trying to hold
back my tears.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
So, Gen, maybe you should
quit running your mouth

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
and put your hands to work.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
Got me. I admit, I was
procrastinating a bit.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.327 position:50% align:center
[GEN snickers]

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
Anyway, before long,
he used the miracle fluid

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
to bring back this super
tough guy named Tsukasa.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.008 position:50% align:center
We live in the stone world now--

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
a paradise that hasn't
been ruined by greed.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
I think we should only revive
the young and pure-hearted,

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
and make sure that we
keep this world natural

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
and not owned by anyone.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
This is our chance
to purify humanity.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree with me, Senku?

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
No, I don't. That speech
didn't move me one millimeter.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
I'm going use the awesome
power of science

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
to rescue every last person.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
[GEN] To put it lightly, this
was an ajor-may disagreement.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
So, while Tsukasa is all like,
"Let's build a new world!"

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
and revived the strongest
people to join him,

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
Senku decided to build
a kingdom of science

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
right here in this village
in order to fight him.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center

[BOY B]
Tsukasa stinks!

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
By the way, Senku,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
the reason we worked so
quickly on the cell phone

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
was so we could execute a
preemptive strike on Tsukasa.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
We should get
moving soon, right?

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
Spring's around the corner
and they're gonna come knocking,

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
so what's next?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
What's next?

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.538 position:50% align:center
Well, we gotta finish our
ridiculously awesome

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
science project and
make this super item.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
And what is this super item?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take
agility and speed

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.047 position:50% align:center
to defeat the Tsukasa empire.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
That's why we'll need
plenty of humanity's

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
greatest survival
science creation.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
We're whippin' up
some space food!

--Huh?
--Space food?

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center

Yep, here we go again!

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Senku's got another craft

that could never exist
in the stone world.

[KASEKI chuckling]

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.573 position:50% align:center
So, what is "space"?
I was wondering.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
Up there. It's that bad place
way, way above the sky!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo!

this is serious.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
Okay, but why do
we need this, uh,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
"space ramen" for the battle?

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50% align:center
Is the plan of attack to launch
lots of steaming hot bowls of it

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
at the enemy?

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
Good guess, but I doubt
it's that, Father.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
There isn't any gravity
way up in space--

not to mention any room or
time to sit down for a meal.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
This stuff is quick to prepare
and mega-nutritious.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50% align:center
It's also small, light,
and ultra-portable.

I'm talking about
the ridiculously

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.259 position:50% align:center
well-thought-out scientific
delicacy that is space food.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa won't attack
in the winter

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
partly because he
wants more men,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center

reason for him to wait.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center

It's a pretty obvious problem.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
In this stone world,

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
an ice-cold winter battlefield
is a frozen version of hell.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
But to us, that's
just another hurdle

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
we can clear by using science.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
Once we develop a
warm, proper meal

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
that we can prepare instantly,

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
then we'll have a ten

[SENKU]
Just like it sounds.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
By literally freezing it

That's really all
there is to it.

moisture inside turns to ice.

[GEN] Yeah, obviously.
I get that part. So then what?

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Then, you put the
frozen food in a vacuum,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
and the total lack of air
in the environment

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
will sublimate the ice.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
Poof! Turning it
directly into vapor.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center

drying out the food,

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
which makes it ultra-tiny

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
People of Japan, please listen.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
The world hasn't
really collapsed.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
In fact, the United States
has already recovered.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
Help is on the way to Japan,
so please stand by.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
You'll deceive everyone on the
other side with false hope,

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
offered by a zombie Lillian
created to tell a big, fat lie.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:29.132 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, we're definitely gonna
wind up in hell for this.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
Okay, got it.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
We'll settle the details later.
Let's go with that plan.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
That quick?! No way!

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
Ah! "Got it," huh? Well,
I don't get it at all!

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
I think you're gonna need to
spell out the plan from the top,

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
mentalist, real slow.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
Step by step, then.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
One: Get the phone to
Taiju and Yuzuriha.

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
Two: They show it
to Tsukasa's army.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
And three: We play
them Lillian's song.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
Then, the trick.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
Howdy! Calling from America.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
The world hasn't actually
collapsed, y'all.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
[SENKU chuckles]

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
They think the old
world's been destroyed

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
and every country wiped out.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
That's the only reason
they're following

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
their great leader, Tsukasa.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
Well, to be fair,
it was destroyed.

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.556 position:50% align:center
But if they think that
America's back in action

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
and help is on the way,

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
then that'll change
their entire calculus.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:25.105 position:50% align:center
Once the bulk of Tsukasa's
army has switched

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
from his side to ours, we
coordinate using our cell phones

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.151 position:50% align:center
and conquer them
in one swift move,

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
without spilling
a drop of blood.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Wait, won't they figure out
you lied at that point?

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but who cares?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
With Tsukasa and Hyoga down,

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
we can worry about sorting
the rest of the mess out later.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
Leave it to the
mentalist to come up

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
with a ten billion percent
underhanded plan like that.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
So exciting!

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[GEN] Naturally, everyone
in the Tsukasa empire

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
is going to hate our guts

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.844 position:50% align:center
for playing such a
cruel trick on them.

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
There's no helping it, though.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.516 position:50% align:center
Keep this a secret from the
rest of the villagers, okay?

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
I don't think we
need any villains

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
besides the two of
us old-worlders.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Sure, great idea.

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.279 position:50% align:center
Except now that you've told me,
I'm an accomplice.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
Hey, you were the one who barged
in on our private conversation.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
Quite literally.

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll be the one carrying
out the plan, anyway.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.581 position:50% align:center
You'll need a technician on hand

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
to set up that giant-ass
cell phone, won't you?

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
They'll recognize you. Not me.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] We'll go to hell
together--the three of us.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
But in exchange, we'll save
seven billion people.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] All right, mission
team's set and ready to go.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
Three people with three jobs.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
Chrome, the engineer.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
Magma, the hauler.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
And Gen, the guide.

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
Huh. Seems like there's a
problem you're forgetting.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
The Tsukasa army scout, Homura.

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
From the lack of snow
on the branches,

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
I think it's safe to assume
she's been keeping watch

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
from that hill over there.

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
You can see that?

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
How's that possible?

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
Smart place to watch from.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.956 position:50% align:center
It's right on the path between
here and the Tsukasa empire.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
If they find out we're
planning a preemptive strike,

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
or even worse, learn that we
managed to create a cell phone,

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
then it's all over.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What if we have
the team set out

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
We're carrying vacuum
tubes, though.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
If we trip in the dark,
then they'll break.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.472 position:50% align:center
Think you could outrun her?

00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
Hauling all this stuff? No way!

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
And Homura is rather ast-fay.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
An easy fix.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
We're gonna lure the empire's
scout away from her position

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
with the help of a
super science gadget.

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
While she's distracted,
the mission team moves.

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
[CHROME] And what exactly is
this super science gadget?

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:24.075 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] If you run
electricity through water,

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
it sends hydrogen and
oxygen bubbling out.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
The mixed gas you get is
called a detonating gas.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
Use it to inflate a deer
bladder like a balloon

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
and you've got yourself a weapon

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
that'll make a wimpy explosion
but a ridiculously loud nose.

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
In other words, a sonic bomb.

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
Right, here we go.
Time for our preemptive strike.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
Detonate... sonic bombs.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
Move! Now! The other side!

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] We're bringing the
battle to the Tsukasa empire.

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
The epic Stone Wars
are about to begin.

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
This is exhilarating.

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.174 position:50% align:center
Get excited!
