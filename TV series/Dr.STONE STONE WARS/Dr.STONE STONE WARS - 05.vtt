[GINRO]
Whoa!

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle
Yay! Now all of us can
go and rescue Chrome!

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:17.292 align:middle
It's like we built a living
creature. It's incredible!

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:24.667 align:middle
[VILLAGERS gasping, chattering]

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.542 align:middle
That thing'll run you over!
Get outta the way!

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:31.333 align:middle
Eriously-say! Steer clear of it,
or else you're gonna get hurt!

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle

[MAGMA]
"Gonna get hurt," my ass!

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:40.792 align:middle
All this thing does is run.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.125 align:middle
Which is exactly why
it's gonna be no match

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:44.875 align:middle
for my number one power!

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.625 align:middle
Ah! Are you crazy?

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:47.958 align:middle
Ha. Wow.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.833 align:middle
Looks like Magma and the
iron steam engine creature

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.042 align:middle
are going to fight it out
right in front of us.

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:53.875 align:middle
This'll be interesting.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:00.917 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.125 align:middle
You don't frighten me!

[MAGMA screaming]

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.167 align:middle
[ALL]
Magma!

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.833 align:middle
That was really dumb, dude.

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:18.333 align:middle
Even muscles as big as yours
won't stop a steam engine.

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.583 align:middle
It truly is like
a living creature.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.167 align:middle
Indeed. One with
incredible strength.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.125 align:middle
The thing's like a big gorilla!

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:28.083 align:middle
Yeah, wild.
Even more than Kohaku!

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle
Ah!

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.792 align:middle
Aww, man, that hurt.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.917 align:middle
Chrome usually takes
these beatings, right?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.292 align:middle
I wish he was back home now.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.542 align:middle
Anyway, this means that we can
all go on the rescue mission.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.042 align:middle
Sure does.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.375 align:middle
Once the engine's finished,

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:44.042 align:middle
the rest of the car should
be pretty easy to build.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:48.708 align:middle
It's our science-powered
monster: The "Steam Gorilla."

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:52.292 align:middle
All right.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:56.375 align:middle
Ishigami Village has
been great to me...

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.625 align:middle
...but I gotta say goodbye.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle
Listen, Senku.

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.167 align:middle
We don't have the
time to be getting

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.375 align:middle
all sentimental and crap,
'cause we got a job to do.

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:10.458 align:middle
Let's throw every last piece
of science gear on board.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle
We're taking our army
to the Tsukasa empire!

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle
So get excited, you guys.

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.458 align:middle
[CHROME]
Let go of me, ya hear?

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:58.625 align:middle
[CHROME yells]

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle
That hurt, ya bastards!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.208 align:middle
Hey, do you think this
wimpy bamboo cage is enough?

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:10.375 align:middle
'Cause it's gonna take more
than this to hold me!

[HYOGA]
Tsukasa.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle
Is there a reason we're
keeping him out in the open?

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle
[HYOGA gasps]

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle

[GEN] It's so shaky and rattly!
It's gonna collapse!

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.292 align:middle

before we can even get there!

Ah! So ad-bay!

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:57.208 align:middle
Oh, why? Why me?

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:00.167 align:middle
Why do I have to be the
test driver, anyway?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.208 align:middle
Because you're the only one
with a driver's license!

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:05.458 align:middle
Why would that
matter this world?!

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:08.167 align:middle
[SENKU] Still gotta respect
those traffic laws.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.875 align:middle
[GEN] You're that much
of a stickler for rules?

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.708 align:middle
[SENKU]
Not even for a millisecond.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.542 align:middle
[GEN]
Which is it?!

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle
Regardless of that, these wooden
wheels are gonna ork-way.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle
We won't be driving
on paved roads.

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.917 align:middle
So do we have tires, or what?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.583 align:middle
Don't worry! All of us kids
are working super hard!

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:29.292 align:middle
We're weaving bamboo!

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.042 align:middle
Hm? Bamboo?

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.167 align:middle
That's a tire?

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.458 align:middle
Yeah, like the airless
tires developed by NASA

00:05:39.542 --> 00:05:41.417 align:middle
for planetary exploration.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.958 align:middle
Ours are made from woven bamboo.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:47.125 align:middle
A great idea, but you know,
I've never heard of that before!

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle
I wasn't a big science
fanboy like you, Senku.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle
It's finished, you guys!
Woo-hoo! Check it out!

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:58.292 align:middle
The Steam Gorilla
is ready to go!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle
I don't understand it at
all, but it's so cool!

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:06.625 align:middle
Yeah. I'm confused,
too, but it's awesome!

Sure, it's incredible,
and I'm really impressed by it,

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:13.083 align:middle

freaking out over it?

That's how it is.

sad all of a sudden.

[GEN, RURI, KOHAKU]
Hm?

00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle

get Chrome outta there

as soon as we can.

They've got him locked up and
I just feel so sorry for him.

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle
Tsukasa does need
him as a hostage,

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:40.625 align:middle
but who knows how
they're treating him?

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:42.917 align:middle
[KASEKI] No, no!
I'm not talking about that!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.083 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:46.875 align:middle
Building this
incredible creation

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.417 align:middle
was one of the coolest
things we've ever done,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle
but since he got
himself captured,

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:53.833 align:middle
he had to miss out on the
whole experience entirely!

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:57.292 align:middle
I bet all of America would be
crying for him right about now.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.833 align:middle
So we gotta get
over there pronto

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle
and flex our Steam Gorilla
right in his face!

[GEN] The science team sure is
a kind-hearted bunch, huh?

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.167 align:middle
[RURI] I guess that's how
friends behave sometimes.

We're ready to move
out when you are!

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle
Let's start this rescue mission
and go get Chrome!

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.208 align:middle
Yeah. Time to get going.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.458 align:middle

Hey, Senku.

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:36.417 align:middle
We think that it would be
best if we stayed behind.

[BOTH gasp]

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle
The elder folks have
all talked it over.

00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:43.792 align:middle
You youngins could bring
the science gear yourselves,

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:46.708 align:middle
it would just take a
couple more trips.

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:48.125 align:middle
So why did you build this

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:51.708 align:middle
so-called "automobile"
contraption?

00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.958 align:middle
Because us old folks
would slow you down

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.208 align:middle
or stop you from getting there.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:08:00.417 align:middle
We've got you completely
figured out. Right, Senku?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.125 align:middle
Nah, that's not it.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.542 align:middle
Honestly, I mostly built it

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.792 align:middle
because I love using
science to create things.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.583 align:middle
We'll stay behind.
We belong in Ishigami Village.

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.917 align:middle
We really don't want
to be a burden to you,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.125 align:middle
much less get in the
way of the battle.

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.167 align:middle
And without us taking up room,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.042 align:middle
you can bring more
science tools.

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle
Don't stay!
That's too dangerous.

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:25.917 align:middle
She's right.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.250 align:middle
And what if the enemy sends
reinforcements this way?

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.083 align:middle
You won't stand a
chance against them.

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:33.042 align:middle

You're all so sweet, but we're
not worried about that.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.583 align:middle

the least of our concern.

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.208 align:middle
[SENKU]
Huh?

[NATORI]
You wanna know why?

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:55.958 align:middle
[NATORI]
Because we have faith.

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.542 align:middle
You'll beat the Tsukasa empire

00:08:57.625 --> 00:09:00.958 align:middle
before they get a
chance to come here.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.917 align:middle
Isn't that right?

00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle
Yeah, 'course we will.

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.083 align:middle
We'll fight together.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.333 align:middle
And when we come back home...

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:23.125 align:middle
[KOHAKU] ....we'll have the
kingdom of science flag

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.625 align:middle

too. It's cool.

Woo-hoo! I'm so impressed
by our Steam Gorilla.

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:01.875 align:middle
It's holding up!

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.667 align:middle
That's 'cause we're
on level ground.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.625 align:middle
Although it's a bit of a
roundabout way, I'll confess.

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle
I've made this trip
a couple of times,

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:11.708 align:middle
so I know how to avoid
any steep inclines.

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:13.208 align:middle
Till now.

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:16.583 align:middle
We can't skip all of them. Yeah.

We'll have to push it together!

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:29.458 align:middle
The wobbler engine's
good, but still,

00:10:29.542 --> 00:10:32.583 align:middle
it does need some momentum
to keep it turning.

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.792 align:middle
Yeah, we would've had
a whole lot more power

00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:37.125 align:middle
if we'd built a
double-cylinder engine.

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle
Trying to save time
backfired on us.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle
[gasps]

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.292 align:middle
[SENKU]
More power.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.833 align:middle
[KOHAKU] All right. There's even
more of a climb ahead.

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.583 align:middle
[KINRO, MAGMA]
Huh?

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle
Hey. What's up, Senku?

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.417 align:middle
[laughing]

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.583 align:middle
That's a seriously
evil grin, you guys!

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:03.917 align:middle
[SUIKA] That face tells me that
he's definitely up to something.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle
[KOKUYO]
We'll set up behind this ridge.

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle
The natural protection is
perfect for our field camp.

00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:14.917 align:middle
Production'll be
down at the bottom.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.417 align:middle
We'll try to hide the smoke
and stuff behind the trees.

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.333 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
First, we need to figure out

00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:23.125 align:middle
where they're holding Chrome.

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:25.417 align:middle
Not much we can do until then.

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.625 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
But where do I start looking?

00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:30.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:32.542 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
Suika?

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.292 align:middle
[SUIKA] Now's the perfect time
for Great Detective Suika

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:37.417 align:middle
to make herself useful!

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:41.708 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:03.083 align:middle
[SUIKA] No luck. There's not
a sign of him anywhere.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle
[CHROME]
This is bad!

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:19.708 align:middle
This is so boring!

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:21.667 align:middle
I'm all cooped up in
this stupid little cave

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle
with the bamboo grid
over the entrance!

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.292 align:middle
[MAN E] Why the hell did he just
start screaming like that?

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:31.583 align:middle
[SUIKA] That was Chrome.
He's still alive and well!

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle
[KASEKI] Ya put yourself
in serious danger, ya know?

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:41.875 align:middle
[KOKUYO]
Very well done, Suika.

00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.292 align:middle
[SUIKA] They had so many
guards around, though.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:45.958 align:middle
[MAGMA laughs]

00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:47.833 align:middle
That just means we'll have
to charge straight in there

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:49.792 align:middle
and murder every
last one of em'!

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:51.542 align:middle
You gotta be kidding.

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.917 align:middle
I'm not so keen about
murdering them,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle
but the part about charging
in might not be a bad idea.

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:00.958 align:middle
Say what? Do you
really think so?

00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle
Because I don't wanna be
the one doing it, myself.

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle
It just sounds crazy!

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:08.458 align:middle
We're gonna bust down that
bamboo prison with brute force.

00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:11.333 align:middle
I mean, we've got an amazing
mech on our side, right?

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:14.917 align:middle
Our science-powered monster,
the Steam Gorilla.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.958 align:middle
All it needs is
an insane upgrade

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:18.875 align:middle
and we'll have a real
tank on our hands!

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:21.667 align:middle
[KASEKI cries]

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.125 align:middle
[KASEKI]
We're really gonna modify

00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle
my adorable little Steam
Gorilla after all the hard work

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle
and care we put into it?

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle
[GEN]
"Adorable"?

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.958 align:middle
[KOHAKU] Don't think
that's the right word.

00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:32.333 align:middle
[KINRO]
It isn't adorable.

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:33.542 align:middle
[GINRO]
I wouldn't call it that.

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.125 align:middle
[SUIKA]
It's like the opposite.

00:13:35.208 --> 00:13:37.417 align:middle
No, we're giving it a power-up.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.167 align:middle
Oh! Seriously?

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:45.625 align:middle
Then let's upgrade it!
Right now! Come on!

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:51.042 align:middle
Okay, Senku. How exactly are
we giving it an upgrade?

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:54.625 align:middle
Easy. We're gonna give it
a ridiculous amount of armor.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:57.833 align:middle
Turn it into a tank that we can
ram straight through their army

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle
So cover it with iron?

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:02.958 align:middle
That would make it way too
heavy to move one millimeter.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle
To use it as a ram,
we'll need speed.

00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:07.792 align:middle
Of course, yeah.

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.917 align:middle
So then what will we
cover it with, instead?

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:17.625 align:middle
Paper.

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle
"Pape-hair"?

00:14:18.583 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle
"Pa-Prayer"?

00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:22.667 align:middle
I get it, Senku!
A paper tank, huh?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.792 align:middle
That would certainly
be nice and light.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:26.375 align:middle
What?!

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:35.708 align:middle
[SUIKA] We got a ton of grass
and weeds and stuff!

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle
It doesn't matter what kind
of plants we get, does it?

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.833 align:middle
Nah. Any kind works.

00:14:40.917 --> 00:14:43.042 align:middle
We just take this
bundle of grass

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:46.458 align:middle
and boil it down
in sodium hydroxide.

00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:48.083 align:middle
Mecha-Senku here again!

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:53.333 align:middle
If you're trying this at home,
use bleach or baking soda, okay?

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:55.917 align:middle
[SENKU]
We take that boiled mess of goo,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.792 align:middle
wash it, press it down,
and dry it.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.958 align:middle
Whoa! This is legit!

00:15:03.042 --> 00:15:05.583 align:middle
I had no idea paper
was so easy to make.

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:08.083 align:middle
It'll come in handy for
making blueprints and stuff.

00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:10.083 align:middle
Just think of all the pelts
we could've saved

00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:12.958 align:middle
if we'd had access
to paper before!

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:15.292 align:middle
[KINRO]
What's so great about it?

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.583 align:middle
How is somethin' this flimsy
gonna do us any good?

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:22.125 align:middle
Sorry, but I agree
with him, Senku.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.542 align:middle
I hope you're not suggesting
we use such weak material

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.375 align:middle
to make armor for our car.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.833 align:middle
Yeah, that is what
I'm suggesting.

00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:38.833 align:middle
Hold on just a second.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle
That looks like a
Japanese paper door.

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:44.167 align:middle
That's ten billion
points for you.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.708 align:middle
Now we just iron it out

00:15:45.792 --> 00:15:50.208 align:middle
and we get the stone world's
first paper shield.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.292 align:middle
That does it.

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:54.708 align:middle
We'll manufacture
a bunch of these

00:15:54.792 --> 00:15:57.292 align:middle
and add them to the sides
of the automobile,

00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:00.167 align:middle
turning the Steam
Gorilla into a tank.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:05.625 align:middle
Senku. You may not be
aware of this, but...

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:15.625 align:middle
[KINRO]
A blow from a spearman

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.083 align:middle
can split even a wooden shield.

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:20.792 align:middle
Considering the weapons
we'll be up against,

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.917 align:middle
I have a hard time believing
in the effectiveness

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.292 align:middle
of a paper one.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:26.208 align:middle
Yeah, that goes
double for me!

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:27.583 align:middle
Oh?

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:30.083 align:middle
Sounds like that'll make
for a perfect test, then.

00:16:30.167 --> 00:16:31.375 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:16:31.458 --> 00:16:33.833 align:middle
So, you wanna fight me?

00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle
This isn't good!

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:40.417 align:middle
Senku and Kinro are about to
battle each other for real!

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.458 align:middle
A battle? Why would
they do that?

00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:44.958 align:middle
Oh, boy.

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:48.125 align:middle
And the spear that Senku asked
Kinro to use for the test,

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.625 align:middle
it's not for sparring
sessions, is it?

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:53.417 align:middle
It's the eal-ray deal.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.875 align:middle
This is too risky. I can't--

00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.708 align:middle
It's not a true test
if you don't come at me

00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.333 align:middle
with your full strength.

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:01.417 align:middle
That's what the rules say.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.458 align:middle
And "the rules are the rules,"
aren't they? According to you.

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:10.417 align:middle
All right, then. I won't
hold back whatsoever.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.333 align:middle
Senku!

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:26.125 align:middle
[KINRO gasps]

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.167 align:middle
[GINRO]
Whoa!

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.333 align:middle
[KOHAKU]
Senku actually won!

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.958 align:middle
That thing totally
shattered Kinro's spear.

00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle
And Senku's shield
wasn't so much as dented!

00:17:36.583 --> 00:17:39.583 align:middle
Huh? How'd a paper
screen do that?

00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:41.542 align:middle
Give him a second.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.917 align:middle
[KOHAKU] I think he's going
to need a little time

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.958 align:middle
before he can answer
any questions.

00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:50.875 align:middle
[SUIKA]
Look at him shaking.

00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:55.167 align:middle
He did stop the blade,
but he still took the impact.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle
That wasn't just regular glue

00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:59.083 align:middle
you were painting onto
the paper, was it, Senku?

00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:00.542 align:middle
Yup, bingo.

00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle
I'll give you ten billion
additional points for that.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle
Actually, I painted
molten plastic onto it.

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:10.875 align:middle
Combine the flexibility of paper
with the rigidity of plastic,

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.125 align:middle
and... boom!

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle
Ya got ya some carbon fiber.

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:18.667 align:middle
Carbon-- I'm pretty sure
I've heard of that stuff!

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.875 align:middle
It's a stupid light
and stupid tough material.

00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.167 align:middle
They use it in Formula One
car bodies and rockets.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.167 align:middle
I'd rate it at SS agility
and SS defense.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.292 align:middle
The ultimate component!

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:41.958 align:middle
Whoa! Check out
the Steam Gorilla!

00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:46.625 align:middle
Look at it now! This baby's
powered up! Woo-hoo!

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:49.542 align:middle
[SUIKA] That's the toughest
looking thing I've ever seen!

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle
[SENKU] Now it's got
a double steam engine,

00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:55.375 align:middle
front-wheel drive, and insanely
huge caterpillar tread wheels.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.292 align:middle
We can pull it off!

00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:58.667 align:middle
As long as we have this tank

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.708 align:middle
fortified with the
ultimate material!

00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958 align:middle
[KOHAKU] All we gotta do is ram
into the prison and destroy it,

00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:10.375 align:middle
then we can save Chrome
without any bloodshed at all!

00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:17.708 align:middle
[CHROME] I'm sure Suika told the
others where I'm being held,

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:20.083 align:middle
but I really hate
just waiting here.

[MAN F]
Gotta go pee.

00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:23.667 align:middle
[MAN G]
Hey, idiot! Not over there!

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.167 align:middle
[MAN F gasps]

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.917 align:middle

[CHROME gasps]

00:19:29.458 --> 00:19:32.583 align:middle
[CHROME]
Bad. That's--!

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.917 align:middle
[HYOGA]
A trap?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.917 align:middle
Coal would be fairly
easy for them to obtain

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.667 align:middle
if quality isn't an issue.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.917 align:middle
Yes, and besides gunpowder,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle
the next scientific
threat to be wary of

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:49.458 align:middle
is an assault with some
kind of steam engine.

00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:51.417 align:middle
[HYOGA]
A steam engine?

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.542 align:middle
You think that's a real
option in the stone world?

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:56.708 align:middle
[TSUKASA] Sooner or later,
they'll get there.

00:19:56.792 --> 00:19:59.083 align:middle
Senku's capable.

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.667 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.375 align:middle
[HYOGA] So that's why you put
him practically out in the open.

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:07.083 align:middle
You're anticipating that they
might try and ram the cell.

00:20:07.167 --> 00:20:11.708 align:middle
I get it. We're just using
Chrome as bait.

00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:16.375 align:middle
Senku likes to act
cold-hearted,

00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:20.583 align:middle
but he's not the type
to abandon his friends.

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:25.417 align:middle
Sentimentality.
That's his fatal flaw.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle
[yells]

00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:30.042 align:middle
Hey, listen, Senku!

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:31.292 align:middle
Once we rescue Chrome,

00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle
we could use the Steam
Gorilla on their army.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:38.375 align:middle
Scare 'em away and send 'em
runnin' for the hills!

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:43.125 align:middle
That way, we might not even
have to fight 'em ourselves.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.458 align:middle
[SENKU chuckles]

00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:46.333 align:middle
Yeah, maybe if it's still
actually running

00:20:46.417 --> 00:20:48.583 align:middle
after we slam the thing
into the prison.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle
It was built to save Chrome,
and that's about all.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.875 align:middle
[KASEKI, GINRO]
For real?!

00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle
It's meant to be a one-shot
surprise attack machine.

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:57.792 align:middle
If they figure us out,

00:20:57.875 --> 00:21:01.292 align:middle
and prepare for a vehicular
assault, we're done.

00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle
[MAN G laughs]

00:21:03.083 --> 00:21:04.417 align:middle
[MAN G]
Here. There.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.833 align:middle
We've got anti-vehicle
traps everywhere!

00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:08.917 align:middle
[MAN G, MAN F laughs]

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle
If they try to come in and
save their little friend,

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle
they are gonna be screwed!

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.625 align:middle
[CHROME]
No! It's a trap, Senku!

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.583 align:middle
Please don't come rescue me!

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:22.292 align:middle
But how do I let 'em
know? Somebody--

--[BOTH gasp]

[CHROME]
Damn, what am I thinking?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.875 align:middle
"Somebody come rescue me"?

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle
What am I, a kid crying
for his mommy and daddy?

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:38.083 align:middle
Hell no!

00:21:39.833 --> 00:21:42.083 align:middle
[CHROME]
I'll be the one.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.458 align:middle
I'll save Senku and the others.

00:21:45.542 --> 00:21:48.667 align:middle
It'd be such a waste to
only use it once, though.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.958 align:middle
Maybe if we could mount
a cannon on top,

00:21:51.042 --> 00:21:52.375 align:middle
we could use it to go on

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.667 align:middle
and take over the miracle cave
or something like that.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.458 align:middle
Stop it. You're talking
in hypotheticals.

00:21:57.542 --> 00:21:59.167 align:middle
Now that's a real waste.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.042 align:middle
Ha. I hear you, Senku.

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:04.958 align:middle
But If Chrome figured
out how to free himself,

00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:08.375 align:middle
then we could make
an even bigger move.

00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:10.708 align:middle
[CHROME] I'll figure out
how to free myself.

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:15.167 align:middle
All I need...
is the power of science!

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.417 align:middle
Yeah, I got this.
I'm Chrome, the science user.
