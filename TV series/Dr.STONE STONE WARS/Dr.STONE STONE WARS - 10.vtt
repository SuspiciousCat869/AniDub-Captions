[SENKU chuckles]

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Hey, Tsukasa!

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.394 position:50% align:center
This isn't a battle between
strength and science.

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
Because science
actually is strength.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
There's a word you know
that came straight

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
from the Ancient Greek
word for "power."

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.572 position:50% align:center
And that's "dynamite."

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Oh, wow. Magnificent.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
To negotiate. Sound good?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
She's still alive, isn't she?
I'm talking about your sister.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
We might be able to heal her.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.723 position:50% align:center
Because the revival fluid has
a residual healing effect.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.894 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] The terms are
pretty simple, really.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best
to revive your sister.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.941 position:50% align:center
And in exchange,
I'm asking for a cease-fire.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.203 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Mirai.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.965 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Senku!

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
Mirai's naked!
Don't look at her!

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
No! You can't revive
her right now!

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.890 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Here we go again
with this same nonsense.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
This is an emergency,
and we're in the stone world!

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.478 position:50% align:center
Nobody cares if
you're buck-naked,

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
or if your peepee's hanging out.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
Man, you really love
this bit, huh?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.151 position:50% align:center
Look, we'll figure it
out once we wake her--

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.778 position:50% align:center
Is this about the right size?

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.655 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
So fast!

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA]
She's all set! Go on, Senku.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
Whoa. That's bad!

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
[KOKUYO] The stone statue,
it's starting to crack apart.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.730 position:50% align:center
It's actually turning
into a real live person.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.399 position:50% align:center
That's right, the villagers
haven't seen this stuff

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.859 position:50% align:center
in action before.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:33.445 position:50% align:center
And now for the moment of truth.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
[YUZURIHA]
Please.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
I really hope this works
and heals Mirai

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50% align:center
just like it did Senku.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
And when the stone falls,
please just let her be okay!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.124 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
The revival fluid has
worked great so far.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.962 position:50% align:center
Just consider who
it's been used on.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
Taking people who're ten
billion percent brain dead

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
and giving 'em a huge wakeup
call is all it's done.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
a brain's a brain.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:03.141 position:50% align:center
I don't see a reason why this
one would be any tougher.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
What just happened?
Where am I?

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mirai.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
[MIRAI]
Big... brother?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
Wow. You've gotten super old.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
You look really
handsome, though.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
How many years have
I been asleep?

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Six years. No...

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
It's been thousands
of years, Mirai.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] Even though there
was no chance for recovery,

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
he kept on fighting
and never gave up hope.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
For years and years.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU] You've been waiting
for this, haven't you, Tsukasa?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
All that time...
for this very moment.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
[KOKUYO]
Now, grab your stuff!

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
We'll head back to the others
waiting for us at the village!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[VILLAGERS]
Yeah!

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Mirai.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
You still have some little
bits of rock on you.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50% align:center
It's doing a disservice
to your beauty.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Why don't you go
and wash up, huh?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
Down at the river, there.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
[CHROME]
Senku.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
We seem to be missing a
few sticks of dynamite.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
Ehh. Well, we used
a bunch of that stuff,

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
so we probably just lost
count, don't you think?

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
No! I'm the scavenger king.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
I never misplace or
lose count of anything.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
If somebody had stolen it, I'm
positive I would've heard them.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
It would take somebody
who was very skilled

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
in covert missions
to fool my ears.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.926 position:50% align:center
I can only think of one person.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Huh? What gives?

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
Mantle was supposed
to be in charge

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
of watching over Homura's cell.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
I don't see him anywhere.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
That guy is always
slacking off.

[SUIKA] Uh-oh! This is
really bad, you guys!

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
Seriously? I'm busted already?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
[YO]
Oh, yeah.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
I just figured out how I can
get myself back on top.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
All I gotta do is nab that jail-
breaking monkey boy, Chrome.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who knows which
direction Chrome went off in.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.064 position:50% align:center
He's gonna lead me right to
the enemy camp, and Senku!

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
Uh? Ah!

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
[YO] That's it! Awesome!
That only took a few seconds!

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
Guess I haven't lost
my touch, after all!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
Homura.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
[HOMURA]
Yo. Go and contact Hyoga.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
Wait until the time is
right, then free me.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
Because Hyoga's true
objective is to...

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
[GINRO yelps]

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
An accident?

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
No, can't be.
Doesn't feel right.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.184 position:50% align:center
[KOHAKU]
Where'd it come from?

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
I think that's the miracle cave.

Get away from it!

[MAN A] Did anybody get
trapped in there?

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
Head count, now!

[KASEKI cries]

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center

buried in there!

Without it, we won't
be able to make

more science weapons
anytime soon!

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
[UKYO]
It's Homura.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
But why did she attack
the miracle cave?

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Homura doesn't do anything
on her own volition.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
She's following
someone's instructions.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
And who's that?

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

[explosion]

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[gasps] An explosion?
What's happening?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
Wait. I'll go check it out.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
Get away from him, now!
Mirai! Tsukasa!

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Before, whether
I snuck in from behind

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.273 position:50% align:center
or attacked you in your sleep,

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
I'd never be able to take
down Shishio Tsukasa,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.031 position:50% align:center
"the strongest primate
high schooler," so easily.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
But that changed once
you finally had

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
somebody else to protect.

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
I was the one who'd
been waiting.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
All this time. For this moment.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center

Senku!

Tsukasa!

[KOKUYO] Kohaku, wait!
The current's too fast.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
You see? And you're not
gonna find them underwater!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
[UKYO] Let's go. We'll look
for them downstream.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] My spear went
clear through his chest.

00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
It's fatal. You won't
be able to save him.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hang on!

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] I knew we would
drift ashore here.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
I'd run a test of sorts.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Yeah, I'm sure you did, Hyoga.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
No way you'd have taken
the risk jumping after us

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50% align:center
if you weren't sure
you'd survive.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Indeed.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
And now that Tsukasa's
effectively out of my way,

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
Senku, you and I can finally
have a private discussion.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
What are you, some kind
of shy middle schooler

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.895 position:50% align:center
mustering up the courage
to confess your love?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
Hate to break it to ya,
but I'm already married.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.900 position:50% align:center
Wait, actually, I'm divorced.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
Either way, I don't
have one millimeter

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
of interest in chatting.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
I'd expect not.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
But I'd like you to hear
what I have to say.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
Whether you act upon it
by persuasion or torture,

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
either way will work for me.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Of course,
we had our differences,

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
but Tsukasa and I shared
one fundamental belief.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
And that is...

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.675 position:50% align:center
...the phenomenon of
petrification that afflicted

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
our entire species
thousands of years ago

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.763 position:50% align:center
was to select certain humans.

00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
To thin out the herd,
so to speak.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.104 position:50% align:center
I find that idea to be like,
ten billion percent unexciting.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
You realize unfounded
speculation like that

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
would be nothing but a joke
to the scientific community.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Regardless of why
it happened, Senku,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.411 position:50% align:center
there remains a basic fact
that even you can't deny.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
There's absolutely no
way that this planet

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
can sustain seven billion
people indefinitely.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
So then, who is to live on?

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.758 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
Hyoga, what do you think?

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
The lives of the young
who have a future,

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
they should have priority.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
We can eliminate the
established powers

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
who do nothing but take
from those below them.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.561 position:50% align:center
This is our chance
to create a new world.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] What our high-minded
friend Tsukasa was aspiring to

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
was a kind of Shagri-la

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
where no one took
from their fellow man.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.991 position:50% align:center
Personally, I don't have a shred
of interest in such a thing.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
If we revived only
brain-dead fools

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
selected solely because
of their youth,

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50% align:center
eventually we'd be taken from

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
in order to keep
their bellies full.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.087 position:50% align:center
Therefore, careful selection
is absolutely necessary.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
In this new world, only the most
superior are meant to survive!

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
And the mediocre must perish.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
That's the most logical
answer, right?

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
The petrification gave
humanity the chance we--

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Yeah, you're right, it's
all just ridiculously logical.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
While that may be so,
it's not exciting.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] I say if we can't
sustain seven billion people,

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
then let's try having
seven billion people

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
look for a way to
sustain seven billion.

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
After all, that's the way
science does things.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:36.418 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Indeed, Senku.

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
The power you wield with
science is impressive,

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
and although it may take time,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
I know you can make
more nitric acid.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
So let's conquer
the world together

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
and select the right
people for humanity.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
The two of us could form
an unstoppable tag team.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] The only acceptable
answer is "yes."

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
Until you say that, you'll
lose one finger at a time,

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
then I'll move on to your legs.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
I thought you understood
the choice here.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
I'll get my way through
persuasion or torture.

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Get back, Hyoga! Just stay away!

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
How embarrassing.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.677 position:50% align:center
It's far too late for these
kinds of theatrics, Senku.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
It seems as though

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.889 position:50% align:center
I overestimated you
a bit, after all.

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:33.266 position:50% align:center
Shut up, will you?!

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.278 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
So I'll make you this promise.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
As long as we're together,

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.500 position:50% align:center
the two of you will not
be in danger again.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.212 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] I broke the promise
I made to you back then.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
Because I thought I had to in
order to realize my ideals.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
And yet still, you kept
the one you made to me.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA] Now it's my
turn to keep my word,

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
honor the promise.

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
[TSUKASA]
This time, I mean it!

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
I swear, I won't let you
be in danger ever again,

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
'cause from now on, I'll be
the one in charge of fighting!

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] That just means that
I need to kill you together.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
Until this point, Tsukasa and I
ruled this new world as equals.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
But with him on his last legs,

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
the title of "strongest
primate" belongs to me!

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
He's only saying that to try
and break our spirits.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.968 position:50% align:center
Still, his assessment
does ring true.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess it does.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
Tsukasa, I definitely trust
your judgment on that.

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
So let's fight together,
Senku. You with me?

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
You bet. Let's show
him a real tag team.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
We're gonna take him down
with science and might

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:09.279 position:50% align:center
working side by side,
so get excited!

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Are you really
trying to strategize

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
your plan of attack right now?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Well, I won't be waiting around
for you to figure things out!

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
A pair up of a wounded lion

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
and a kid who's never
thrown a punch in his life

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center
would make for humanity's
weakest tag team!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] Don't get cocky, Senku.
I'm keeping an eye on you.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
Eleven o'clock!

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Gunpowder!

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.136 position:50% align:center
This dude is a monster!

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Now he's coming for me,
without missing a beat.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:23.561 position:50% align:center
Stop right there!

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
I can use the power
of science to kill you

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
with just one finger!

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Only your primitive friends

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
would be foolish enough to fall
for that kind of bluff, Senku.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Give up, Tsukasa.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
You have no chance against
me as you are now.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've
already realized this,

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
but the hole I pierced
through your lung is fatal.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You're right, Hyoga.

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:16.906 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] So why are you wasting
your energy with this struggle?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Your fate was sealed
from the very beginning.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's just because I...
wanted to keep fighting.

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
For as long as I could,
even for just a minute.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's how fun this is.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
This fleeting moment of
fighting together...

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.225 position:50% align:center
This final partnership...

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Is that so?

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Well, unfortunately for you,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:53.026 position:50% align:center
I'm going to put an end
to all of your fun.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
[SENKU]
Yeah... it's all over.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA] A bandage over his
finger? The one I'd cut?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
What'd I tell you earlier?
You remember, don't you?

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
I said I could use the power
of science to kill you

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
with just one finger.

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
I see.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
That flame earlier.
How did he light it so quickly?

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:33.733 position:50% align:center
Primitive science has its
perks from time to time.

00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.235 position:50% align:center
If these were lithium batteries,

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
your little jab would've blown
me into a billion pieces.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
But these manganese
batteries are tough enough

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
to be both a weapon
and a shield.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
How? Where did you--?

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.414 position:50% align:center
When did you have time
to make this thing?

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
[SENKU] Heh. Don't tell
me you forgot already.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Hyoga, you were the one
who was kind enough

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
to deliver all the materials
I needed right to me.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
Just hook some batteries up

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
to the thin wire coil from
a cell phone, and boom,

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
you've got a high-
voltage transformer.

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
It's the birth of a
100,000-volt stun gun.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
And just for the record,
Tsukasa, this tag team...

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:16.317 position:50% align:center
...was a ton of fun for me, too.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
Now, Tsukasa and I are gonna
give you a little present.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
The gift of science.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:38.631 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.768 position:50% align:center
[HYOGA]
Wretched... science.
