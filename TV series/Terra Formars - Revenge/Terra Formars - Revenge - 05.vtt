he's hiding?

Does he have explosives?

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.028 position:5% line:83% align:start
Relax. We're the only ones with
access to explosive materials.

00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:52.931 position:5% line:77% align:start

merely a burst fire
extinguisher.

00:06:52.964 --> 00:06:56.100 position:19% line:77% align:start
He's only been knocked
unconscious, so settle down
everyone.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.203 position:5% line:77% align:start

How very Russian of him.

00:07:03.438 --> 00:07:08.441 position:5% line:77% align:start

making booby traps with only one
hand.

00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:09.875 position:21% line:89% align:start
But he's all alone.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.378 position:7% line:77% align:start

admirer won't have a pulse much
longer.

00:07:14.412 --> 00:07:17.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
If he came here knowing that
then he must have a plan.

00:07:17.247 --> 00:07:20.316 position:5% line:83% align:start
And I'll be damned if I let him
see it through to the end.

as well.

00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:50.724 position:7% line:77% align:start
Alexander was far more driven
than I had expected. I
underestimated him.

[Sighs] Today was a disaster.

00:20:54.627 --> 00:20:58.529 position:7% line:83% align:start
And yet I can't help but admire
him. Do you understand why?

Well...

courage and honor must be given
their due respect.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.723 position:30% line:77% align:start
Especially when the one
responsible for ending a
soldier's bold crusade,

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:40.691 position:64% line:89% align:start
is oneself.

00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:46.695 position:5% line:77% align:start
I hate to interrupt sir, but we
only have one missile launcher
left.

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:49.363 position:5% line:83% align:start
We'll only be able to fire a
single missile at a time.

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:51.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
That gives Squads One and
Two a lot of freedom.

00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:53.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's certainly not ideal.

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:57.002 position:5% line:83% align:start
What concerns me more is the way
these weapons were destroyed.

00:21:57.035 --> 00:21:57.669 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:59.071 --> 00:22:01.438 position:10% line:77% align:start
This couldn't have been done
with any weapon Alexander
possessed.

00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:03.873 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's only one weapon on
this forsaken planet,

00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
that's capable of cutting
through a missile launcher...
