Once we get to Annex One, we'll

back to Earth. Let's go!

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:39.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
We should be able to reach Annex
One by end of day.

Good.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:35.315 position:5% line:77% align:start
To be honest I'd rather sit this
one out. Unless this is a direct

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.517 position:33% line:89% align:start

 <i>Then that means...</i>

00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:10.663 position:10% line:71% align:start
The surviving crew needs to

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:11.930 position:78% line:89% align:start
Right.

 <i>(Petra) As we expected. To</i>

00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:21.805 position:33% line:83% align:start
This reckless plan was
doomed from the outset.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.743 position:7% line:77% align:start
We all suspected complications
were likely to arise during this
mission,

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:34.616 position:5% line:71% align:start
yet we still sent our countries

planet infested with giant
murderous cockroaches.

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:38.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
The result: mass crew
