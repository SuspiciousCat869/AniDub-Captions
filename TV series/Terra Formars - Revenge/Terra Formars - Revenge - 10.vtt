 <i>(Narrator) Akari and Michelle</i>
 <i>are hostages of Squad Four's</i>
 <i>Bao.</i>

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:15.629 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>But the M.A.R.S. Ranking 1</i>
 <i>fighter, Joseph, has rescued</i>
 <i>them.</i>

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:20.134 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>Channeling his rage, he has</i>

 <i>terraformars.</i>

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:23.972 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>Now the heroes turn their</i>
 <i>hopes to their comrades</i>
 <i>underground,</i>

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.674 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>and their plan to take back the</i>
 <i>Annex 1.</i>

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.978 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hundreds of bio-magnetic fields
just disappeared.

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:34.515 position:7% line:77% align:start
There's a chance it was poison
gas, a biological weapon, or
radiation.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.118 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I know it wasn't a nuclear
explosion.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.521 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Wolf) The morning sunlight will</i>
 <i>burn through any remaining</i>
 <i>bacteria.</i>

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:41.991 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Wolf) And the wind will blow</i>
 <i>away any residual poison.</i>

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:44.660 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Wolf) Once we're in, we hack</i>
 <i>the communications tower.</i>

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:47.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Wolf) Gaining control of the</i>
 <i>system shouldn't be difficult.</i>

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:50.399 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Wolf) Remember, engineers like</i>
 <i>us set the thing up.</i>

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.905 position:10% line:77% align:start
And that's when we send the
message to Earth: Squad Four has
betrayed all of us.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.209 position:10% line:83% align:start
Whoever controls that tower,
controls the battle.

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:01.945 position:7% line:83% align:start
Opportunity is knocking. Let's
take the fight to them.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.557 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Amelia) I've totally lost</i>
 <i>track. Is it daybreak up there?</i>

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is it time, Wolf?

00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:55.665 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not quite. Squad Four hasn't
moved out yet.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:01.139 position:5% line:77% align:start
[Groans] Man, I'm starving.
Keiji, do you have anything to
eat?

00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:01.773 position:86% line:89% align:start
No.

00:03:02.373 --> 00:03:03.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Peggy) You can blame me.</i>

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:05.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
I used up all of our food
provisions.

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:07.179 position:5% line:89% align:start
As you should.

00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:10.983 position:7% line:83% align:start
You have great echidna digging
power.

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:14.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what got us this far. You
needed food to fuel your effort.

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:15.954 position:33% line:89% align:start
He's right.

00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:18.824 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have an idea. Hang on.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:25.265 position:13% line:77% align:start
[Efforts] The milk of the
short-beaked echidna is known to
be highly nutritious.

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:30.203 position:13% line:77% align:start
Its composition is wholly
unique. And I can excrete it
from my skin.

00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:32.205 position:35% line:89% align:start
Try some.

00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:33.606 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uhh.

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.351 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Jet) We're back in business.</i>

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:47.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:53.894 position:10% line:77% align:start
Soon after Bao recovered First
and Second, we lost contact.
Let's go back him up.

00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:58.266 position:5% line:83% align:start
You both should eat, you're our
best fighters.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.700 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uhh.

00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:02.871 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Marcos) Well, we should be</i>
 <i>practical. Don't mind if I do.</i>

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:04.239 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Keiji) Aren't you eager.</i>

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:05.974 position:38% line:89% align:start

 <i>Squad Four leaving the Annex 1.</i>

00:04:11.847 --> 00:04:16.685 position:13% line:77% align:start
About time. Now is our big
chance to sneak in there
undetected. Let's go.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.904 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:38.041 position:7% line:77% align:start
We're heading for General Liu.
They probably don't know about
Hong.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:39.910 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just drag them out into the

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
