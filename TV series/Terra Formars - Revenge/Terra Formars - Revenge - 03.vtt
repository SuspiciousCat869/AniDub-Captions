 <i>(Sylvester) Squad Four has</i>
 <i>initiated the retrieval of Akari</i>
 <i>Hizamaru and Michelle K. Davis.</i>
 <i>Just as planned.</i>

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.254 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Sylvester) It's proving to be a</i>
 <i>difficult task so they've</i>
 <i>requested our help.</i>

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:22.559 position:5% line:77% align:start
As it stands, we're on schedule
to complete all of our mission
objectives.

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.529 position:7% line:83% align:start
I assure you I'll kill anything
that stands in our way.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:28.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Aaron) I don't think we're</i>
 <i>gonna have any problems. </i>

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:32.303 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Aaron) If the terraformars were</i>
 <i>going to make a move, they'd</i>
 <i>have done it by now.</i>

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:38.745 position:7% line:5% align:start
Good. Then that settles it. We
will respond to their request
for help and honor our alliance.

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:42.749 position:5% line:5% align:start
In order to ensure the safety of
our squad, we'll split into two
groups.

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:44.719 position:19% line:89% align:start
And, uh, Alexander...

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:45.920 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:48.522 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have a special
mission for you.

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:27.904 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Narrator) Akari Hizamaru and</i>
 <i>Michelle K. Davis are in grave</i>
 <i>danger.</i>

00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:32.643 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Narrator) After a week of</i>
 <i>travel, the joint Squad has</i>
 <i>reached the Annex One,</i>

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:35.546 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Narrator) and fallen right into</i>
 <i>Squad Four's trap.</i>

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.020 position:10% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Narrator) Led by Liu Yiwu,</i>
 <i>Squad Four plans to seize Akari</i>
 <i>and Michelle for</i>
 <i>experimentation.</i>

00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:47.660 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Narrator) But, Captain Komachi</i>
 <i>has stormed the enemy camp to</i>
 <i>stop Squad Four's betrayal and</i>
 <i>save his crew.</i>

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:51.398 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) This ends now!</i>

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:59.507 position:7% line:77% align:start
Now you all listen to me. I've
injected your leader here with
hornet venom.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.947 position:5% line:77% align:start
He's paralyzed and experiencing
a pain that no words could
adequately describe.

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:07.784 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) At this rate, he will</i>
 <i>die.</i>

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:12.123 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) By now the venom has</i>
 <i>reached his eyes, blinding him.</i>

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:18.197 position:7% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) Soon gangrene will</i>
 <i>overwhelm his extremities, and</i>
 <i>his cardiopulmonary system will</i>
 <i>cease to function</i> .

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.700 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) He will die a slow</i>
 <i>and agonizing death.</i>

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.537 position:13% line:5% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) But there is an</i>
 <i>antidote. It's part of my</i>
 <i>distinctive weapon.</i>

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.506 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) I've never found a</i>
 <i>benefit for having it.</i>

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:32.880 position:5% line:77% align:start
It even lowered my Mars Ranking.
But now I've discovered its
perfect use.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.815 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Shokichi) Squad Four...

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:35.883 position:30% line:89% align:start
Surrender now!

00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:39.154 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Screams]

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.690 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've got you now...hornet!

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:46.896 position:5% line:77% align:start
What I'm about to ask of you may
sounds crazy, but do not worry
about me!

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.163 position:80% line:89% align:start
What?

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:49.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
Shoot his legs!

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.201 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Growls]

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:53.604 position:35% line:89% align:start
Open fire!

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:04.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Grunts]

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:07.553 position:13% line:89% align:start
Artificial metamorphosis!

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:09.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's been fun, Captain.

00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:13.460 position:27% line:89% align:start
Play times over.

00:04:13.927 --> 00:04:18.199 position:7% line:83% align:start
Has it fully sunk in yet? That
victory belongs to us.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
[Gasps]

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:22.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
I can see betrayal is foreign to
you, Captain.

00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:26.675 position:5% line:83% align:start
But I'm sure you can appreciate
the complexity of our plan.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:31.014 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) It is naive to think</i>
 <i>that we are all working</i>
 <i>toward one united goal.</i>

00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:35.286 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) Our M.A.R.S. rankings, our</i>
 <i>files, even the bases of our</i>
 <i>genetic procedures,</i>

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.025 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) were meticulously tailored</i>
 <i>in order to gain the upper hand</i>
 <i>when fighting other humans.</i>

00:04:40.058 --> 00:04:43.695 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) Contrary to what you</i>
 <i>thought, my base is not the</i>
 <i>anaconda.</i>

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.631 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Liu) That would be too obvious.</i>
 <i>My base...</i>

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.702 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is the blue-ringed octopus!

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:53.807 position:7% line:77% align:start
It is endowed with the potent
neurotoxin known as
tetrodotoxin.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:58.045 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) This chemical cocktail is</i>
 <i>potent enough to kill twenty-six</i>
 <i>adult humans.</i>

00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:02.217 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Liu) Though in minute doses, it</i>
 <i>can have therapeutic benefits</i>
 <i>for pain.</i>

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.856 position:10% line:71% align:start
 <i>(Liu) In other words, I can</i>
 <i>completely block the effects of</i>
 <i>your precious little hornet</i>
 <i>venom.</i>

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Liu) I feel nothing at all!</i>

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:11.694 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now then.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.368 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want the captain's wounds
tended to. He's our hostage now.

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:21.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hong! Get me in touch with
Michelle Davis.

00:05:21.305 --> 00:05:24.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, right! You can do it
Hong! Don't mess this up.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm a lousy hostage.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.647 position:64% line:89% align:start
Why's that?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.549 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not good.

00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:35.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
General Liu, it looks like
they're trying to escape!

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:40.795 position:55% line:83% align:start
Who's on board
those vehicles?

00:05:40.828 --> 00:05:42.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, sir!
I don't know.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.074 position:10% line:71% align:start
Quite the conundrum. Safe to
assume Michelle is piloting one
unit while Akari pilots the
other. Correct?

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:53.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are a number of ways I
could get them to return.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.681 position:5% line:77% align:start
They know what they need to do.
They're much smarter than you
think.

00:05:58.182 --> 00:06:03.788 position:16% line:77% align:start
 <i>(Shokichi) They know to</i>
 <i>retreat. Regroup. Reorganize. To</i>
 <i>create a new plan of attack.</i>

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:08.194 position:13% line:83% align:start
They will not return here
unprepared. Go ahead.

00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:11.864 position:7% line:83% align:start
It won't matter how loudly you
broadcast my screams.

00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:15.601 position:13% line:77% align:start
I hate to admit it, but I
believe you're telling the
truth.

00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.306 position:10% line:89% align:start
So then let's cut the crap.

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you're willing to negotiate
their surrender...

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.015 position:5% line:83% align:start
I may be of a mind to spare you
your life, Captain.

00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:28.684 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:34.724 position:5% line:77% align:start
You were always such a terrible
liar, you know. I think I'll
pass.

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:39.997 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've called my bluff.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.633 position:7% line:89% align:start
Can't blame a guy for trying.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:48.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well then. I guess this, is
goodbye.

00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:50.775 position:35% line:89% align:start

[Groans]

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
You have a rather eager
trigger finger there, Boa.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.894 position:5% line:77% align:start
Oh, my apologies, sir. The
captain himself proved he is a
useless hostage.

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:09.298 position:5% line:77% align:start
I felt he was intentionally
stalling us so our targets could
get farther away.

00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:15.104 position:7% line:77% align:start
Good point. Our situation only
becomes more dire the longer we
stand around wasting time.

00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:17.874 position:5% line:83% align:start
Issue a final warning to vessel
one.

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:20.076 position:7% line:83% align:start
If they don't respond, fire on
the second vessel.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.878 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait...

00:07:21.912 --> 00:07:22.213 position:83% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.218 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>(Hong) Bao, how did you adjust</i>
 <i>the AA gun to target Shokichi?</i>

00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:28.187 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>(Hong) I mean...</i>

00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:32.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
Doesn't that gun only target
terraformars in motion?

00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:34.294 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't feel good.

Hong! Don't breath.

00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:38.765 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a chemical weapon!

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.034 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where's it coming from?

00:07:41.402 --> 00:07:43.204 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you guys seeing what I'm
seeing?

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.072 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was it all an illusion?

00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:46.441 position:33% line:89% align:start
