Hi there! I'm Yuriko Minamoto.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.386 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:58.055 position:47% line:89% align:start

Uh...Uh...

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.494 position:44% line:89% align:start

the hospital there.

You got a really awesome name
there kid.

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:16.301 position:52% line:89% align:start

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:24.674 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hizamaru!

00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:31.679 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hizamaru Shingan School.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.183 position:7% line:77% align:start
That's what was written on the

where I was abandoned.

 <i>was my birth name.</i>

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:56.530 position:13% line:77% align:start
Though different in every
language, the meaning was the
same.

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:58.531 position:24% line:89% align:start
It means, "Light."

I'm telling you all this.

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:13.791 position:5% line:77% align:start
Only compounded by the discovery
of their increased rate of
evolution here.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.762 position:7% line:77% align:start
One theory suggests an ancient
civilization may be behind
humans inherent unease,

00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:21.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the roaches unnatural
growth.

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.466 position:7% line:89% align:start
A civilization called "Rahab."

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:29.335 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ancient texts refer to it as...
"Home of the Demons."

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:32.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>It may have been a planet</i>
 <i>between Mars and Jupiter.</i>

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:38.541 position:13% line:77% align:start
 <i>Other theories assert they</i>
 <i>possessed a means of</i>
 <i>interstellar travel and visited</i>

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:43.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
 <i>Mars, Venus, the Moon, Europa,</i>
 <i>and our home, Earth.</i>

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.249 position:19% line:77% align:start
 <i>Leaving behind on each</i>

 <i>their presance.</i>

00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:52.485 position:7% line:83% align:start
I always thought that was just
some crazy conspiracy theory.

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:56.821 position:5% line:77% align:start
I once held the same belief, but
over the past decade it's become
undeniable.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.725 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>We've seen things on Earth and</i>
 <i>Mars that can only be</i>
 <i>explained by the use of</i>

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.593 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>unknown technology. </i>

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.496 position:13% line:77% align:start
The pyramids on Mars and the
terraformars' accelerated rate
of evolution...

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.000 position:10% line:77% align:start
Another theory proposes that
there may be something here on
Mars that can control evolution.

00:05:14.034 --> 00:05:16.769 position:19% line:83% align:start
... that if anyone could've
created such a thing,

00:05:16.802 --> 00:05:19.771 position:16% line:77% align:start
it would have been Rahab
and their revered godlike
abilities.

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:25.675 position:10% line:77% align:start
 <i>that was the thoery posed by</i>
 <i>B.U.G.S project chief, commander</i>
 <i>Alexander Gustav Newton...</i>

 <i>Sharing his beliefs, Russian</i>
 <i>President Smiles quietly</i>
 <i>supported him,</i>

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:32.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>and implemented</i>
 <i>new mission parameters.</i>

00:05:32.446 --> 00:05:34.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Our main objective was to find</i>
 <i>the device...</i>

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:39.418 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>Once located, we were either to</i>
 <i>destroy it, and end the war, or</i>
 <i>steal it and,</i>

 <i>return to Earth, so that</i>
 <i>humanity could experience</i>
 <i>enhanced evolutionary as well.</i>

00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:48.357 position:5% line:77% align:start
As you might imagine, the latter
option was the preferred outcome
of the two.

00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:52.560 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's why I instructed Squad 3
to investigate the pyramids.

00:05:53.828 --> 00:06:00.231 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>But the hypothesis was wrong. We</i>
 <i>were unable to find proof of any</i>
 <i>device's existance.</i>

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.703 position:5% line:77% align:start
Throughout history, humanity has
destroyed and stolen from many
civilizations.

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:11.040 position:5% line:77% align:start
But it appears that won't be the
case for us up here. Nothing to
steal, nothing to destroy.

00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:13.407 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's nothing here but
a pile of ruins!

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.711 position:5% line:83% align:start
What's left is nothing more than
one tremendous mistake.

00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:46.106 position:80% line:89% align:start
What?

00:19:46.706 --> 00:19:48.274 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your birthday, it's today.

00:19:48.974 --> 00:19:51.109 position:5% line:89% align:start
April 19th, isn't that right?

00:19:51.376 --> 00:19:53.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's today... I think.

00:19:53.578 --> 00:19:56.779 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Assuming my count of how long</i>
 <i>we've been here is accurate.</i>

00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:57.947 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:19:58.649 --> 00:20:00.449 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well then I'm really screwed.

00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:02.050 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>It's not that bad.</i>

00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:03.285 position:27% line:89% align:start
Twenty-five huh?

00:20:03.884 --> 00:20:05.119 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well at least...

00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:07.454 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't feel older.

00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:10.022 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckle]

00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:12.457 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well you look good, all things
considered.

00:20:13.058 --> 00:20:15.192 position:7% line:5% align:start
Sometimes I <i>really</i> do hate you.

00:20:15.226 --> 00:20:19.795 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh... Wait, shit! That's not
what I meant... never mind.

 <i>Before joining this mission, I</i>
 <i>was worried about what kind of</i>
 <i>scum I'd be forced to work with.</i>

00:20:27.401 --> 00:20:30.870 position:10% line:5% align:start
 <i>I was cautious of a crew of</i>
 <i>volunteer human lab rats,</i>

00:20:30.903 --> 00:20:32.904 position:10% line:5% align:start
 <i>who willingly gave up their</i>

00:20:33.138 --> 00:20:36.274 position:13% line:5% align:start

 <i>was, Dad.</i>

00:20:36.308 --> 00:20:38.542 position:7% line:5% align:start

00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:41.144 position:13% line:5% align:start
 <i>But here I am. You got me</i>
 <i>here.</i>

00:20:41.177 --> 00:20:45.480 position:13% line:5% align:start
 <i>And I've been blessed with</i>
 <i>good comrades. Friends who care</i>
 <i>for me as much as I do for them.</i>

00:20:45.514 --> 00:20:48.149 position:7% line:5% align:start
 <i>This mission has given me new</i>

00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:52.419 position:24% line:5% align:start
 <i>Now leading my new</i>

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
Happy birthday. Michelle Davis.

00:20:57.388 --> 00:20:59.490 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah... I guess so.

00:21:01.558 --> 00:21:06.995 position:7% line:77% align:start
 <i>Father... I just need a little</i>

 <i>thank you... </i>

00:21:07.028 --> 00:21:10.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>Thank you for your strength. For</i>
 <i>always being there.</i>

00:21:11.098 --> 00:21:12.832 position:21% line:89% align:start
[grunt] Let's hurry.

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:15.335 position:10% line:83% align:start
We need to get in touch with
the Captain.

00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:19.003 position:5% line:83% align:start
We never expected the journey to
be this difficult.

00:21:19.304 --> 00:21:22.839 position:7% line:77% align:start
It's imperative that we reach
Squad 6 and ask them for
their help.

00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:25.608 position:24% line:5% align:start
Hey Akari, are you ready?

00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:27.009 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure.

00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:31.012 position:10% line:5% align:start
[groan] I feel like every bone
in my body is broken.

00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:35.649 position:16% line:5% align:start
I'm curious why Squad 4 only
fired one measly missile our
way.

00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:37.916 position:13% line:89% align:start
[wince] God damnit! [gasp]

00:21:37.949 --> 00:21:41.353 position:7% line:77% align:start
We need Alex and Yaeko to get
their asses in gear and pick us
up.

00:21:42.219 --> 00:21:43.520 position:50% line:89% align:start
 <i>Where are they?</i>

00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:47.190 position:10% line:83% align:start
They should've seen us, they
were still close by.

00:21:54.362 --> 00:21:56.363 position:5% line:89% align:start
Look! Here they come.

00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:03.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:22:05.202 --> 00:22:07.371 position:16% line:83% align:start
Akari and Michelle have
been located.

00:22:08.137 --> 00:22:09.038 position:33% line:89% align:start
Retrieving.

00:23:44.438 --> 00:23:47.273 position:10% line:5% align:start
(BAO) <i>The name's Bao Zhilan,</i>
