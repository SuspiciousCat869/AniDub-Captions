1
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,166
"Of the Dead."

2
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,833
When there's no
more room in hell,

3
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,416
the dead will walk the earth.
Or so the sayin' goes.

4
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,916
Well, we got the same problem
right here in Daten City.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,583
Only we got angels.

6
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,500
And dildos.

7
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,958
You'll see.

8
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,708
This is some bad shit, Stockin'!

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,875
Just shut up and hammer!

10
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:40,291
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,666
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

12
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,750
They're all immune!

13
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,541
That's why you
should hammer, stupid!

14
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,250
Fine I WILL!

15
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,750
Take that, dog-dick!

16
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,416
You've been shooting
them for three hours!

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,750
And you think a hammer's
gonna magically do the trick?!

18
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,333
Shut up, bitch!

19
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,375
Where did these freaks
come from, anyway?

20
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,708
Yeah the cops
didn't say anything

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,458
about all these
fucking ghost zombies.

22
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,458
I thought it was just
s'posed to be a pizza party.

23
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,041
Huh?

24
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,375
What the flying fuck now?

25
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,708
Hey!

26
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,000
We only fled here 'cause
we heard bad-ass angels

27
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,250
were named honorary
police chiefs for the day.

28
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,333
So do something, man!

29
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,375
What can we do?

30
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,708
Our weapons
ain't workin' for crap!

31
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,000
They bit me, you know,
you gotta cure this.

32
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,666
If I eat a brain
that shit is on you!

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,750
I bet they're not
even real angels at all!

34
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,083
Look at them!

35
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,750
Angels don't dress up
like slutty stripper cops!

36
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,375
Yuh-huh!

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,291
What the hell are you
doing, you dumbasses?!

38
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,625
Are you trying to
let the zombies in?

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,500
Don't walk away from us,
this is mob rule, bitches!

40
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,291
We haven't resolved
this imposter issue!

41
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,083
This look fake to you?!

42
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,250
Hey! Who groped me?!
I will bleed you out!

43
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,125
Hey, friends.

44
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,416
We've got a plan!

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,250
Everyone knows
zombies hate fire.

46
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,875
This will clear us a path
through the parking lot.

47
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,958
We'll run for it and get
help from the next town over.

48
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,291
No one's running yet!

49
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,208
Though you do seem to
have the runs, don'tcha?

50
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,916
Talk some sense into
these asshats, will ya?

51
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,333
I've heard that
there's an ancient

52
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,166
and secret technique in Voodoo
for turning ghosts into zombies.

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,625
Heavenly weapons will have no
effect on these double-undead.

54
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,208
But we must not despair yet.

55
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:28,416
They do have at least one
weakness. The answer-- Uh-oh.

56
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,416
Can't hurt to try!

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,791
Yes it fucking can!

58
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,041
How?

59
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,791
Ow!!

60
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,750
Bad idea, bad idea!

61
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,291
Come on, honey.
We've gotta run!

62
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,625
Fuck my butt!

63
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
This isn't looking real good.

64
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,416
It's the worst honorary
police chief party ever!

65
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,833
The pizza didn't
even have meats on it!

66
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,708
Smash their brains.

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,250
That's what their weakness is...

68
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,541
It's the only way you're
gonna kill these ghost zombies.

69
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,958
That's their secret
weakness, their brains?!

70
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,000
But that's just like
a regular zombie!

71
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,541
You can't kill a ghost with
a bat, that'd be stupid.

72
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,666
There has to be
something magical,

73
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,166
like holy water
or silver bullets.

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,375
Nope, bat works.

75
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,333
Then what makes them ghosts?

76
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,083
Just having little
swirlies around them?!

77
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,833
That's weak sauce!

78
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,875
Zombies gonna act like zombies,
no matter what they was before.

79
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,375
Be that human, ghosts,
or even angels like you hos.

80
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,250
Well, we can't stay here,
we're sitting ducks!

81
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,166
They've got us
totally surrounded!

82
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
I think there's a gun
shop across the street.

83
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,000
We can stock up on
normal weapons there.

84
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,791
Fine, let's go!

85
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,625
Panty time?

86
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,500
You bet.

87
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,750
Go, go, go!

88
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,541
If your body's not
rotting, then follow me!

89
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
Wait, this isn't a gun
store, it's a sex shop!

90
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,750
A sex shop!!

91
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,875
Sorry. Force of habit and all.

92
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,208
Are you out of your mind?

93
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,583
Now we're trapped again!

94
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,958
What could we find here
that could possibly help us?

95
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,875
Something new to
stick up your ass?!

96
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,875
This is no time to fight,
you titty-stains.

97
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,125
Hey!

98
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,666
We wouldn't be in this
mess if you hadn't used

99
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,916
your connections to make us
stupid honorary police chiefs!

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
Yeah that's right!

101
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,500
We never shoulda' come with you
to this bumfuck town, anyway!

102
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,458
You begged me for this!

103
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,541
You wanted pizza and donuts!

104
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,791
Oh, how simply scintillating!

105
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,541
This is precisely what
those fecal-mouthed angels

106
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,750
deserve for pretending
to be cops for a day.

107
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,416
I love spoiling parties.

108
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,875
Like they have the curves
to pull off those uniforms.

109
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,166
Kneesocks, my dear,

110
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,416
might you get the next
batch of zombies ready?

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,708
Of course, sister.

112
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,583
Absolutely perfect.

113
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,166
Your idea to
purchase Zombie Elixir

114
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,958
from Publisher's Cursing
House and then use it

115
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,125
to turn ghosts into zombies is
so brilliant I can't stand it.

116
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,958
My mind blows as we speak!

117
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,750
Do stop, Scanty,
you flatter me.

118
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,166
I can see that, your
face is awfully red.

119
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,791
Something's
coming our way, girls.

120
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,166
"How are you this
ironing?" Oh. "evening"

121
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,000
God her handwriting sucks.

122
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,500
"We made these zombies just
for you, please do enjoy them,

123
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,291
as you're disemboweled
and eaten alive.

124
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,041
Ghost zombies are simply a ball.

125
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,208
Die you tarts."

126
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,541
Sounds like those
chode-munching sisters.

127
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,333
Oh, they are so dead.

128
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,333
Gimme that!

129
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,083
Take this you little prick-hole!

130
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,625
Eat dildo, motherfucker!

131
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,125
Like that, don't
you fatherfucker!

132
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,583
Bet you screw
your whole family!

133
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,833
Wow Those angels are tougher
than I thought they were.

134
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,791
They're for real! They're
like Charlie's Angels

135
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,791
but with vibrators
instead of guns!

136
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:03,541
Repent, motherfucker!

137
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,708
It's full-on ass kicking time!

138
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,250
The plan's simple:

139
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,833
We fight our way up that hill
and kill the cooter sisters!

140
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,083
All right who's with me?!

141
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,583
Yo!

142
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,041
Blech. They're so gross.

143
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,583
Well you can't
chicken out now, Panty.

144
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,166
This was all your idea!

145
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,375
Okay fine, but
you're going first.

146
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,750
Wait, Let me distract them.

147
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,541
Why?

148
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,875
Who are you?

149
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,083
I've been hanging out
with you bitches all day;

150
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,541
I can't believe you
haven't noticed me yet!

151
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,958
What kind of bullshit is that?

152
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,000
Sorry, man.

153
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,333
Hey is it just me,

154
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,875
or is there a zombie skull
chomping on his head?

155
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,208
Someone about to become a zombie

156
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,041
would make a great
decoy, you guys.

157
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,958
True; and he's got no
reason to live anyway.

158
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,041
Yeah I love this plan.

159
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,250
Hop to it, dead guy.

160
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,625
I've got one somewhat
minor condition.

161
00:07:58,708 --> 00:07:59,875
Write my life story.

162
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,208
And publish it wide.

163
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,458
A book?!

164
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,708
Cause the world needs
to know what happened

165
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,750
through a paperback.

166
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,875
And a hardback.

167
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,083
And an e-novel.

168
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,958
I call it "The Journey
of the Spirit Inside

169
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,416
My Heart Inside
A Sex Shop, by Me."

170
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,083
Here's a rough draft with
all the key plot points

171
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,833
and marketing strategies.

172
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,375
This is taking forever.

173
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,458
Just go die, already!

174
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,791
Wait I can't I suck at writing,
I can barely even read!

175
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,083
I mean, I get headaches
trying to finish comic books!

176
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,666
Plus you only
wrote three pages!

177
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,333
Time to be heroes, wifey.

178
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,625
I love my life.

179
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,000
I love my doll, I mean.

180
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,083
Wife.

181
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,375
Well that worked for shit.

182
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,958
Thanks for nothing!

183
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,041
They weren't distracted at all!

184
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,166
Move to Plan B!

185
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,666
Plan B!

186
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,625
What's Plan B?

187
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,625
Suicide pact?

188
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,583
No, you idiot!

189
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,458
Listen!

190
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,041
You two run as fast as you can

191
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,583
and get to
See-Through out front.

192
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,708
Then pick us up and
save my black asshole!

193
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,541
I can do that.

194
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,208
And you cover us.

195
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,333
All right, living corpses.

196
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,000
Get on your knees
and say hallelujah.

197
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,708
You're about to get a big
mouthful of Heavenly love.

198
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,000
Now we can finally relax.

199
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,041
Omigod, do we have
to go back out there?

200
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,333
We could always ditch 'em
and just go on home.

201
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:32,666
Sounds good I could sure
use a shower about now.

202
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,166
Oh Didn't know you
followed us out, Chuckles.

203
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,375
Ah fuck me.

204
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,583
They just keep
coming, Preacher Man!

205
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,250
Then let them come!

206
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,291
I've got plenty of
whoop-ass mojo to spare!

207
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:57,125
But, shouldn't we hide?

208
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:57,708
Wait!

209
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,416
The notebook!

210
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,958
Oh no!

211
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,166
Did I drop it?

212
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,125
What's the matter, you zombies?

213
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,333
Don't you like how God tastes?

214
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,083
You're really enjoying
yourself out here, aren't ya?

215
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,375
You afro'ed fucker.

216
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,916
That is one sadistic
god fearing dildo weilder.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,541
We did it, we did it!

218
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,791
Look and see, Kneesocks!

219
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
They're done!

220
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,375
You know, Scanty, overexcitement
is bad for your health.

221
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,583
You can't relish the
victory if your heart explodes.

222
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,083
Oh stuff it and look!

223
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,250
Operation: Zombie
was a complete success!

224
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,458
We're brilliant, I say!

225
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,208
Brilliant!

226
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:37,541
Sister, sister, look!

227
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,250
Oh, drat.

228
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,083
So even the divine flesh

229
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,333
of angels is rotten
now, is that it?

230
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,958
I thought it'd be
a fuckin' downer

231
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,458
but it's actually liberating.

232
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,333
Not bad at all.

233
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,666
Hey Stockin'.

234
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
You think we're ever gonna
change back to normal?

235
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,583
I bet it wears off by morning.

236
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,083
That's prob'ly the best
those sisters could do.

237
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:54,958
But who cares!

238
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
I've gotta sweet tooth for meat!

239
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,791
He looks good.

240
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,291
So it's come to this.

241
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,625
You wanna fight to the
undeath, oh you got it.

242
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,750
Just don't whine to me
when you lose your faces!

243
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,625
Well, we still
haven't changed back.

244
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,625
What's your thoughts?

245
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,833
Yeah this could be bad.

246
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,875
So what are we supposed do now?

247
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,041
Zombies can still
have sex, right?

248
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,416
"One Angry Ghost."

249
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
It should be called
Trial by Game Show.

250
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,708
I like One Million Angry Men.

251
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,875
Judgment day!

252
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,458
See the famously accused meet

253
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,750
the brutal hammer of
justice, on--Judgment Day!

254
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,166
We've got a great
program tonight,

255
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,708
as we try two beautiful
celebrity sisters!

256
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,666
Will they be deemed
modern day guardian angels

257
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,958
worthy of our love and
creepy fan letters?!

258
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,833
Or wickedly fallen
hell-bound harpies

259
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,083
deserving of death live on TV?!

260
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,291
Let's bring 'em out!

261
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,000
Give a great big rowdy
welcome to tonight's defendants,

262
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,416
on trial for their lives and
our primetime entertainment!

263
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,708
It's Panty and Stocking Anarchy!

264
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,083
So, how's it feel to
take the defendant's seat

265
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,583
for the first time, ladies?

266
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,708
Feels like bull-shit.

267
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,916
This old guy smells
like taint butter.

268
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,000
Thanks guys!

269
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,458
You know I'd bang
you all if I could!

270
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,041
An impressive following, girls.

271
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,333
But your die-hard, drooling,
crotch-tingling fans

272
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,250
aren't the only people
in the audience tonight!

273
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Now it's time to
introduce our prosecutor!

274
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,541
The hero of our show

275
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,333
and the fierce champion
of victims everywhere!

276
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,791
He's charismatic
and handsome, folks,

277
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,750
and he's sent
ninety-nine criminals

278
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,500
to their gruesome deaths
right here on this program!

279
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,666
The superstar who
loves to jump on things!

280
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,041
Tom Croose!

281
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,291
Respect the cock.
And tame the cunt.

282
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,375
And of course by cock I mean
our hallowed justice system,

283
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,208
that great blind cock
that towers over us all

284
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,250
and comes down hard
on those who do bad.

285
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,458
Like those who
killed Mr. Husband!

286
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,500
And by cunts I of
course mean cunts.

287
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,291
Cunts like these two fallen
angels who ruthlessly snatched

288
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,375
the life away from
our poor victim!

289
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,041
These cunts who must
be tamed before they try

290
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,666
to destroy all the
joys of manhood!

291
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,375
Our cock of justice
will make these cunts wet

292
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,250
with the moist tears of
regret for what they've done!

293
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,416
Now let's take a look
at the video recap

294
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,083
of the crime in question!

295
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,041
Tonight's victim, one
Mr. Husband Petter,

296
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,083
was a cheerful, gentle,
pet-like ghost

297
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,208
who settled down in
our lovely township.

298
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,708
His human neighbors
adored his constant smile,

299
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,791
floppy tongue,
and jaunty gait.

300
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,916
Mr. Petter became Daten City's
first honorary ghost citizen,

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
married another pet-like ghost,
and built a happy, haunted home.

302
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,333
But then tragedy struck!

303
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,625
One week ago, on November 27th,

304
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,041
at approximately 10 PM,
Mr. Husband Petter

305
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,458
was savagely murdered
in Central Park,

306
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,250
while waiting to meet his
dutiful wife, Mrs. Wife Petter,

307
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,541
for dinner and
some light karaoke.

308
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,208
Sounds like a cunt move to me.

309
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,375
So a poor fuck got killed,

310
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,125
what the hell does
that have to do with us?

311
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,500
Do you have anything
close to evidence?

312
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,500
You're glib.

313
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,916
Okay!

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,750
Now it's time for the defendants
to choose the attorney

315
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
who will try to
save their lives!

316
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,125
Your options are
the oldest lawyer,

317
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,958
the cheapest lawyer, or
the highest I.Q. lawyer!

318
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,333
What will you decide?!

319
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,416
Number three is the
only choice, obviously.

320
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,541
It's gotta be some
kind of trick question.

321
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,291
This is a serious show,
we'd never try to trick you.

322
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
Fine, then three.

323
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,083
Lawyer number three, and
is that your final answer?

324
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,500
Final answer!

325
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,791
Please, open the box!

326
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,583
What?! A monkey?!

327
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,500
And say hello to Abrams!
With an IQ of 65,

328
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,666
he's the smartest lawyer
who is also a monkey,

329
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,541
although we couldn't fit
that last part on the sign.

330
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,708
Hello!

331
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,833
Pretty crucial detail
don't you think?!

332
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,625
This is so stupidly unfair!

333
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,083
Abrams passed the
bar exam on only

334
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,625
his ten thousandth, three
hundredth and fiftieth try!

335
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,416
But how can a chimp defend us?

336
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,916
He can't even talk!

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,166
Be relaxed, funny girl human.

338
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,125
I can talk just good.

339
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:18,208
This metal head on head changes
thoughts into human noise barks.

340
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,833
Ooh, tasty nose food.

341
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,583
Surprise yum!

342
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,208
Without further ado,
let's start the trial!

343
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,833
Say hello!

344
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,291
To our unnecessarily
british judge!

345
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,541
This public court is now in
session to try the accused.

346
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,166
All defendants are innocent
until proven unlikable!

347
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,166
Tell me, if you would, so-called
Panty and Stocking Anarchy.

348
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,625
Where were you at 9:55 PM on
the twenty-seventh of November,

349
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
the night of the brutal murder

350
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,208
you two cunts so
obviously committed?

351
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,000
Beats me.

352
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,125
Hell if I remember.

353
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,958
Then let's jog your memories.

354
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,500
Here's a photo of you speeding
through a red light haphazardly,

355
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,375
caught by a traffic
camera on main street.

356
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,250
Oh right, I made Panty
take us to Bobson's

357
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,666
for their new fall
ice cream flavor!

358
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,416
Dead Leaves and Pistachio!

359
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,583
It was delish!

360
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,583
This was taken on November 27th,

361
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,958
the same night as the
savage crime, five minutes

362
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,041
before Mr. Petter's shit
hit the metaphorical fan!

363
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,375
And this camera is exactly
five minutes from Central Park!

364
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,958
Yeah, that's a coincidence.

365
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:11,833
Coincidence?

366
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,583
Unbelievable!

367
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,083
I'm quietly judging you.

368
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,125
What do you do when you see
a rampaging murderous ghost

369
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,958
just strolling through
the city, Miss Panty?

370
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,333
I shoot it, obviously.

371
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

372
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,250
So you admit you'd shoot
a ghost on sight even

373
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,416
if he were completely innocent

374
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,333
and adorable with a
loving wife at home!

375
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,625
Haven't you just
basically admitted that

376
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,333
after buying ice cream
you stumbled across

377
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,333
poor Mr. Husband Petter
and SHOT, SHOT, SHOT

378
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,833
and KILLED, KILLED, KILLED
him just for being a ghost?!

379
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,041
If we killed him we'd
remember, jackass!

380
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,541
Oh?

381
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,791
Can you remember the name

382
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,583
of every ghost you've
executed, Miss Stocking?

383
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,291
Who am I, Rain Main?

384
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,333
We don't ask for their names

385
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,125
when they're
terrorizing the city!

386
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,125
I see, then it makes sense.

387
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
If you don't even ask for names,

388
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,083
how would you remember killing
saintly, cuddly Mr. Petter?

389
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,208
At this point, your honor
I submit into evidence

390
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,541
a weapon carried by these
bloodthirsty defendants.

391
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,708
Weapon, huh?

392
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,750
How the crap did
you get those off me?

393
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,708
The defendants have shown
a well-documented tendency

394
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,791
to hunt down and kill ghosts
using weapons disguised

395
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,708
as tastefully slutty lingerie.

396
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,708
Did I screw you?

397
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,416
These smell lived-in.

398
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,333
Multiple ear-witnesses have
described hearing gunshots

399
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,791
in the park at the time
of the vicious murder.

400
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,625
And the weapon Miss Panty
uses to viciously murder ghosts

401
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,083
just happens to be a gun.

402
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,291
Of course, seeing is believing.

403
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,666
Please show the court
how your panty-gun works.

404
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,958
Ah, not right now.

405
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,166
It's way too much of a hassle.

406
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,916
Whatdaya say, audience,
do you want to see?

407
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,458
Well, you can't argue
with your fanbase.

408
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,000
Ahh, what the hell.

409
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,250
O, pitiful shadow
lost in the darkness.

410
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,583
O evil spirit born of those

411
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,541
drifting between
Heaven and Earth.

412
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,625
Stop!

413
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,125
What do you think
you're doing?

414
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,500
I won't let you make a mockery
of this sacred courtroom!

415
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,000
If it's sacred then why's
there a stripper pole?

416
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,041
Restraints!

417
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,333
He smells my panties yet
somehow I'm the bad guy?

418
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,791
This isn't even tight
enough to be a turn-on.

419
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,541
Banana! Banana!

420
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,791
God damn it,
get off me!

421
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,000
Bad monkey!

422
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,666
Now let's move
to the main event!

423
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,625
Testimony from the star witness!

424
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,708
What you're about
to hear, my friends,

425
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,833
is the heartbreaking
testimony of the

426
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,958
woman-slash-ghost-
slash-dog whose life

427
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,458
was destroyed by those
murderous angel cunts.

428
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,500
I give you the love of
Mr. Husband Petter's life,

429
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,458
Mrs. Wife Petter!

430
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,791
It's all my fault!

431
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,708
I should never have been
late for our dinner

432
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,083
and light karaoke!

433
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,708
Oh, why couldn't
they kill me instead?

434
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,916
If you could send a message

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,458
to your poor husband
now, what would it be?

436
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,333
Come back to me, Sugar-Lump!

437
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,666
--Banana, banana, banana.
--No! Stop! Shoo, shoo!

438
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,583
All right, viewers,
it is verdict time!

439
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,125
Banana!

440
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,333
Everybody in this live audience,
and all you viewers at home.

441
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,666
You're all important
members of this jury!

442
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,291
Press the "guilty" or
"not guilty" button

443
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,166
on your custom
Judgment Day controllers!

444
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,875
Each "guilty" vote will
increase the voltage

445
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,250
that will surge through
their electric chairs!

446
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,541
Now finger those
buttons, people!

447
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,458
Guilty!

448
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,500
Bring on the death!

449
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
Was that good for you?

450
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:24,583
Looks like those angels need
a little more 'lectrolove.

451
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,083
We've got them now!

452
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,291
Let's stop, sister!

453
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,500
The circuit will blow
if we keep this up!

454
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,333
Plus your voice is showing!

455
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,041
As is your gorgeous
red face, my dear.

456
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,416
Oh curse my fragile skin!

457
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,375
I just creamed so fucking hard.

458
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,333
Banana, fried banana!

459
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,666
Whoa, that monkey
is lookin' pretty crispy!

460
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,958
Okay judge, we're gonna need
a new lawyer, this one is done.

461
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,458
Objection!

462
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,333
The claims of the prosecution

463
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,916
in this case are
contradictory, your honor.

464
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,083
How so, talking monkey?

465
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,083
Miss Panty, can you
please inform the court

466
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,291
what happens when you
shoot a ghost with your gun?

467
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,291
Fucker explodes.

468
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,708
Into pieces, yeah.

469
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,208
Yet here we have a picture
of Mr. Petter's dead body.

470
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,583
If the angels had shot him
as my colleague suggests,

471
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,750
there would be nothing
left of his corpse.

472
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,041
Hey yeah, he's right!

473
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,083
Who killed him, then?

474
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,333
Elementary.

475
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,833
It was her!

476
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,875
His body was found covered with
large, animal-like bite marks.

477
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,416
Bite marks that no doubt
match your teeth, Mrs. Wife!

478
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,333
I move for a new
verdict, your honor!

479
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,375
No! Objection!

480
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,291
Overruled!

481
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,875
I admit nothing!

482
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
make your choices!

483
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,000
That's right! I killed him!
It was me!

484
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,708
Ghosts should terrorize humans,

485
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,375
not be their smiley-faced,
little bitch pets!

486
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,958
He deserved to suffer!

487
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,208
That's why I bit him to death!

488
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,458
I married that doormat
so I could live in safety

489
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:17,333
among you humans, but
I couldn't take it anymore!

490
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,875
Quite the blabbermouth,
wouldn't you say?

491
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:23,500
And I presume you're the
masterminds behind this plan?

492
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,333
Those skanky douchers, no way!

493
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,916
Pooh! It would seem
the cat is out of the bag.

494
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
And after all that time we spent
learning your daily routine

495
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,666
so we could ingeniously
frame you for homicide.

496
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,166
Who could've guessed a
wretched chimp would catch us?

497
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,791
I don't know, you were kinda
sloppy with those bite marks.

498
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,041
This is such a downer.

499
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,125
Shall we live to plot to
another day, Kneesocks?

500
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,166
Yes, I think we shall.

501
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,500
Toodle-oo, angels!

502
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,583
Why are those dickheads
always trying to kill us?

503
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,750
You got me.

504
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,000
What are you
standing around for,

505
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,041
you're the
ghost-slayers right?

506
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,083
Use your powers
and slay that ghost!

507
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,208
What happened to keeping
your little courtroom sacred?

508
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,208
Who cares about that when a
ghost wants to eat my ass?

509
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,375
Be as vulgar as you
need to be, Angels!

510
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,250
Drop your panties!

511
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,250
She does panties,
I do stockings, thank you.

512
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,250
You wanna go balls out?

513
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,875
Well we are on live TV.

514
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,500
It's like a dream
come fuckin' true.

515
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,708
Just do it, god damn it!

516
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,458
Shatter your loathsome impurity!

517
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,833
Return from whence you came!

518
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,333
Repent, motherfucker!

519
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,125
Bang!

520
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,500
Carpenter!

521
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,916
And that's a wrap!

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,166
Thanks for watching,

523
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,458
and for putting me in
that feel-good chair!

524
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,041
I guess today's program shows

525
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,708
that the just will
prevail in the end!

526
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,916
Especially when
they're hot chicks!

527
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,041
Banana.
