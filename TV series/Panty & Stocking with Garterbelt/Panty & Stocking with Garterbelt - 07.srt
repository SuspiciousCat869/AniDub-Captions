1
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,875
We know not where
they come from,

2
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:06,500
only that they both are
searching for the same force.

3
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,166
For a time, they
lived in harmony,

4
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,750
but, like all great power,

5
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:16,250
some wanted it for good,
others for evil.

6
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,750
And so began the war.

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,958
Brief, are you kneeling
before me to offer God

8
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,208
your service or are you
just, you know, offering?

9
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,083
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,625
I don't understand the question.

11
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,166
I was hoping maybe.

12
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,916
He could help me stop Panty
and Stocking from fighting.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,958
They're stressing me out.

14
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,083
You see what I mean?

15
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,916
It just never stops!

16
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,791
This isn't autoerotic
asphyxiation,

17
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,958
I'm trying to kill you, so don't
get all snail trail on me.

18
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, you're officially
going too far!

19
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,875
I really hate watching
you two fight.

20
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,958
You never tickle each other or
have pillow fights or anything!

21
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,041
Fuck off, dip shit!

22
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,541
Those crazy hookers
is out of control.

23
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,000
Unexpectedly, the sky
turned an ominous red

24
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,333
as two meteors
crashed into Earth.

25
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,291
What the what?

26
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,708
What. Is. This?

27
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,625
Ohmicrap, I think
it's a meteorite!

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,541
At the end of this day,
one shall stand.

29
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,875
One shall fall.

30
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,125
It's like one'a those 'bots

31
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,166
from that cool old
cartoon slash crappy film!

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't wait to post
about this on the forum;

33
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:23,875
they'll be so jealous.

34
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,041
Welcome alien-toon!

35
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,041
My name is Brief!

36
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,458
Hello. I'm Cocktimus Prime.

37
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm here to end the battle.

38
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,750
Wow, I guess God
really does exist.

39
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,458
So you were sent here to
stop the girls from fighting?

40
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,000
No, you are mistaken, human.

41
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,125
I am not here, alone.

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,500
Wait, did he say
Cocktimus Prime?

43
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,083
My name is Minge-atron,

44
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,583
and I've come to this planet to
make this war my bitch, bitches.

45
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,958
Dude, this is awesome!

46
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,583
And at what are you looking,
tiny gothic creature?

47
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,166
A delicious marshmallow!

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,583
It's not a marshmallow.

49
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,333
As superior robotic life forms,

50
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,458
our cores are naturally on
the outside of our bodies.

51
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,416
What you're looking
at is my heart.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,666
What the fuck?

53
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,708
You shithead!

54
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,125
Yummers!

55
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,125
What part of "that's my heart"
did you not understand?!

56
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,375
I am known as
Gothatron Stocking,

57
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,416
and I will settle this
score once and for all.

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,708
That was so fucking bad ass!

59
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,291
Did that just happen?

60
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,250
Hey, I like your
new look, Minge-atron.

61
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,375
What the hell?

62
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,875
No!

63
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,375
Gross, this tastes
like ass balls.

64
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,166
My name is Rottenass Panty!

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,541
The time has come to make
a motherfucker suffer!

66
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,791
No, you guys!
This is way worse than before!

67
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:36,708
And Okay, Rottenass
Panty's room.

68
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,666
Soundnoise trans-home!

69
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,583
Lovechair trans-home!

70
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,708
Spinbed trans-home!

71
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:41,875
Cattlehorn trans-home!

72
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,583
Condoms trans-home!

73
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,833
Gothatron Stocking's Room!

74
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,291
Torchfire trans-home!

75
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,916
Sugarscream trans-home!

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,125
Cage trans-home!

77
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,333
Skullmuncher trans-home!

78
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,166
Giantdildo trans-homo!

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,833
The Pantybots have
seized the kitchen

80
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,208
and surrounded the
refrigerator!

81
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,000
Remember, Stockin'
is a fatty wannabe.

82
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
All we have to do
is take possession

83
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,125
of her disgusting sweets,
and victory will be ours!

84
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,375
The radar!

85
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,458
Commander, I think
something is inside the--

86
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,166
Snatchet!!

87
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,750
And away we go!

88
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,375
I've already eaten all
of the sweets, Slagbot!

89
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,250
Fuck!

90
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,333
That was a dick move, Stockin!

91
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,208
Do you have any
last words, Panty?

92
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,583
None that you'd want
to hear, Megatwat!

93
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:28,375
The battle between Pantybots
and Stockingcons continues!!

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,416
Later, outside the bathroom.

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,125
Goddamnit, get out of the
bathroom; I really gotta pee!

96
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,708
I hope you piss your face off

97
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,708
while you piss all over yourself
if that makes you feel better.

98
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,250
I'm sorry, what show
am I narrating again?

99
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,916
Wait, Something's up,
she didn't call me a whore.

100
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,000
Ha!

101
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,000
You're not just a whore;
you're a stupid whore!

102
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,666
You and your lame ass
fucking dick moves!

103
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,041
I should have seen that coming!

104
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,375
The Stockingcons escape
trouble by donning diapers!

105
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,291
When it comes to war,
anything goes!

106
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,666
Kill the Bitch!

107
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,833
What will Panty do?!

108
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,041
Pantybot base: in the chapel.

109
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,416
This whole thing is a fucking
disaster; I feel like ass.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,458
Trans-home!

111
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,833
Sorry I'm late, Commander!

112
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,000
Late?

113
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,166
I don't even know
who the fuck you are.

114
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,708
What can I do to
make you feel better?

115
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,916
I can think of a
couple positions.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,208
We're gonna train!

117
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,416
Panty drags the recruit
into a private room.

118
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,625
It's time to screw.

119
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,000
Erection, trans-home!

120
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,916
Oh my God!

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,666
Yes! Right there!!

122
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,041
Screw me baby.
Screw me proper!

123
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,291
Don't stop!

124
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,041
Meanwhile, at the Stockingcon
base in the residence tower!

125
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,916
It's only a matter of
time until this church

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,625
is yours Gothatron Stocking.

127
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,083
My spybot should
have screwed Panty

128
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,833
into a throbbing
metal slit by now.

129
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,416
A little fuck can't be the
end of our problem can it?

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,750
Look at the pussy with
the giant fucking balls!

131
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,666
This planet's not big
enough for the both of us!

132
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,208
Follow Rottenass Panty's lead!

133
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,416
Commence Stockingcon take down!

134
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,000
Why throw away your life
so recklessly, you prick?!

135
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,416
That's a question you
should ask yourself!

136
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,791
It's you and me, Stocking!

137
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,708
No, Panty, it's just me!

138
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,541
Now that is the kind of dialogue
I was expecting to hear!

139
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,916
As the battle between Pantybots
and Stockingcons continues,

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,375
the Earth bears the
brunt of their violence

141
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,916
and bitter rivalry!

142
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,625
The powers of
gothness are greater

143
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,250
than anything your pathetic
sex toys can muster!

144
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,625
Powers of gothness, really?

145
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,875
You're threatening me
with bad hair and eyeliner?

146
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,625
Oh no she didn't!

147
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,958
Oh, uh, I mean.

148
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,291
Stockingcons, don't just
stand there; do something!

149
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,791
The final showdown has come!

150
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,958
Pantybots!

151
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,208
Trans-home and rollout!

152
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,708
I fuckin' hate taxis!

153
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,208
Give it up, Yawnatron!

154
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,583
If I want to know
what's on your mind,

155
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,333
I'll splatter it on the
wall and see for myself!

156
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,458
You want a piece of me?!

157
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,291
No, I want two!

158
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,625
Who will be the victor
in this epic battle?!

159
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,875
Thank God, it was all
just a horrible nightmare.

160
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,625
Excuse me, but you are
standing upon my head.

161
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,000
Get your foot off
my face, human asshole!

162
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,875
I'm so sorry!

163
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,250
Wait, if you guys are still
alive, you can stop them, right?

164
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,750
Not gonna happen, kiddo.

165
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,875
Our existences as superior
robot life forms are at stake.

166
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,875
An overzealous goth
and an oversexed whore

167
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,958
will decide the battle
between us for good.

168
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,208
Well, that hardly
seems responsible

169
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,750
for so-called higher life forms;

170
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,750
I mean, they wouldn't be robots
if it weren't for you guys!

171
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,916
Weren't for us?

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,333
They ate our fucking hearts!

173
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,333
What about your accountability,
did they eat that too?

174
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,250
This isn't about
accountability, mom;

175
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,166
this is about a species
that prides death

176
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,666
in battle above all else.

177
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,708
Look at us, we have no bodies,
our deaths are inevitable,

178
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,041
but what we can still
have is a finale to the war

179
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,500
we've waged since four
years after time began!

180
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,875
So you're cool with
a couple of chicks

181
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,833
finishing this
epic battle for you?

182
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,041
Pretty much.

183
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,041
Will you look at this disaster?

184
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,041
Can you see that?!

185
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,250
They're disgusting!

186
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,208
I don't want to see
them tickle each other

187
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,833
or pillow fight at all!

188
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,666
This is what you want the end
of your existence to look like?

189
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,041
Personally I always did
want it to be sexier.

190
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,166
Indeed, they are quite hideous!

191
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,958
Brief, that was a
really good speech man.

192
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,833
Cocktimus is correct;
you did well human asshole.

193
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,625
I am overcome by how foolish
we've been

194
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,583
to have warred all this time
against each other simply

195
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,875
to allow those two
to fuck it all up.

196
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,750
As of this moment, we hereby vow

197
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,750
to stop acting like
silly Japanese drawings

198
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,166
and declare an
immediate ceasefire.

199
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,333
Come, Cocktimus, let's
put our heads together,

200
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,791
and find a way to salvage what
little dignity we have left.

201
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,375
Yeah, if you work side
by side as friends,

202
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,666
everything'll be cool.

203
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,083
I bet that's this week's moral!

204
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,833
I have an excellent
idea, friend.

205
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,708
I think we can call it our
first official joint effort.

206
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,000
Yay!

207
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,500
We shall seek out the
lesser life forms

208
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,958
inhabiting this planet.

209
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,250
And?!

210
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,541
And make them bleed
like the pussies they are!

211
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,583
Oh, shit!

212
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,458
Oopsie.

213
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,333
Heroes never die!

214
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,041
Rottenass Panty can
never be conquered, bitch!

215
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,916
Hey, guys!
We're all gonna die!

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
What the fuck is that?

217
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,000
I dunno, but Jesus it's huge.

218
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,000
That's a ghost, stupid angels!

219
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,208
How have you not figured
that shit out by now?

220
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,041
It's obviously a grudge
born from extraterrestrials

221
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
who have been fighting
each other since four years

222
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,416
after the beginning of time
and never managed to finish

223
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
their war because they perished

224
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,916
when their home world
was destroyed,

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,166
which was caused by their
very own violent battles,

226
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,541
that has now taken the
form of an evil spirit

227
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,250
bent on seeking
revenge on this planet!

228
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,375
I know we're angels and stuff,

229
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,000
but how can there
be a God and aliens?

230
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,541
Much less alien ghosts.

231
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,958
Off the top of my head, I'm
guessing faith is the answer.

232
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,000
What do you think, cocksucker?!

233
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,541
O, pitiful shadow...

234
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,833
...lost in the...

235
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,000
...dark...

236
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,166
O evil...

237
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,750
...spirits... uh...
Heaven and Earth...

238
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,083
Uh... something about maidens...

239
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,416
...and striking down with great
vengeance and furious anger!

240
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,291
Returning you.

241
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,125
Somewhere for something.

242
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,666
Super God Robot Force!

243
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,083
Hell yeah, who's more than meets
the eye now, mother fucker?

244
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,333
Damn fuckin' skippy, it's about
time we get rewarded for realz!

245
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,875
This could get us back and forth
to Heaven a kabillion times,

246
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,833
so I can keep on getting
my Earthly gummy bear fix!

247
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,916
Yeah, shoulda known it
was too good to be true.

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,375
Hate to shit in your
cornflakes, girls.

249
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,208
But this is alien currency,
and with the exchange rate

250
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,916
it would take a thousand
to equal one Heaven.

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What??

252
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,166
What a relief, right?

253
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,750
I was worried there
for a hot minute, girls.

254
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,416
But I think we all
learned a valuable lesson

255
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,916
about not fighting
and being friends.

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,625
Or not?

257
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,875
Shut up, human asshole!

258
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,833
I really hate that name.

259
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,166
Whore!

260
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,916
I swear females more
trouble than they're worth.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,541
Crazy hoochies need some xanax.

262
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,375
We know not where they
come from, only that both

263
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,375
of them are searching for
the same force type thing.

264
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,916
For a time, they lived in
harmony, but, of course,

265
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,291
some worked it for good,
others worked it for evil.

266
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,416
And so the war began.

267
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,250
Who wrote this shit?

268
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,083
"The Stripping."

269
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,708
You both need to stop
spending money on bullshit;

270
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,458
you're angels, not hipsters!

271
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,833
Hey, cock jockeys!

272
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,166
I'm not just talking to
fucking hear myself!

273
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,291
You've spent over
three million dollars!

274
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,458
Fish flavored lube.

275
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,000
Titty Enhancer.

276
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,083
Toys that ain't sex toys!

277
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,166
And who the fuck
orders that much food?!

278
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
You bitches eat so much

279
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,916
you gonna start
sweatin' bacon grease!

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,708
Garter, if you're gonna act
like a baby, you might as well

281
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,208
crawl back up inside your giant
vagina where you belong.

282
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,416
You're the ones
acting irresponsible,

283
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
so you crawl into my vagina!

284
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,125
You're gonna need
somewhere to live.

285
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,000
This church is fallin apart and
I can't afford any more repairs.

286
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,041
Whatever!

287
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,458
We work our tits
off killing ghosts,

288
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,583
so enough with the pretentious
preaching, preacher man.

289
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,916
Don't make me
throw Chuck at you!

290
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't earn Earthly
money for killing ghosts,

291
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,250
you get Heaven coins!

292
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,666
And when you take out
the motherfucking city

293
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,916
every time you take out a ghost,

294
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,833
I have to pay for it
with my Earthly cash!

295
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,416
Jesus, chill the hell out, yo!

296
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,541
Dude.

297
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,625
You are being such
a pussy about this,

298
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,541
but if us earning
money will get you

299
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,416
to shut your douche face, okay.

300
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,041
Did you say you were
gonna earn money?

301
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,291
That's hilarious!

302
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,500
You two earning money; Like
you have a single skill

303
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,250
between you anyone
would pay for!

304
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,333
We do too have skills, asshole!

305
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,166
How much were you bitching
about us spending again?

306
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,625
What was it,
three million dollars?

307
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,000
Hell, just give three days!

308
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
This would be tragic if
it wasn't so fucking funny!

309
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Please tell me
you're going to put

310
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,416
"sits on ass and farts
all day" on your resumes!

311
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,333
Holy shit!

312
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,750
Very well, then;
I challenge you

313
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,958
to earn three million dollars
in only three days time;

314
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,583
however, when you fail, you must
swear Heaven's Unbreakable Oath

315
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,166
that you will never
waste money again,

316
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,333
and you know what will happen
to you if that oath is broken!

317
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,958
However, when
we win, you fucker,

318
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,500
you're not allowed to complain
about our shopping habits again!

319
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,458
You gotta deal!

320
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,500
It's on now!

321
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,750
Let's go make us
an ass ton of money!

322
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,750
Any idea how we're suppose
to make this money?

323
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,958
Meh.

324
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,416
I just figured we'd
take it from someone

325
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,458
who looks double loaded;
you know, like rich and drunk?

326
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,416
Um, I'm pretty sure
that's against the law.

327
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,291
Maybe you should just
try finding a job.

328
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, we could do this shit
with our fucking eyes closed.

329
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,250
This is not sanitary!

330
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,833
Dude, working
can fucking suck it.

331
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,166
Can you believe people
actually do this all day?

332
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,458
How much have we made so far?

333
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,208
It's gotta be at
least a million.

334
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,833
Uh, actually you two
kept getting fired.

335
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,750
So you haven't
made anything yet.

336
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,125
Don't fuck with me!

337
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,333
We're supposed to make
three million, so try again!

338
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,125
Million dollars?

339
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,291
Yeah.

340
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,375
Our goal is three
million in three days.

341
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,500
Okay, well then
you'll need to average

342
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,166
at least a million
dollars per day,

343
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,375
so there is no way
in hell that's possible.

344
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,541
I just made three
million bucks in one day!

345
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,916
I'm a cash pirate!

346
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,333
Hey there, daddy;

347
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,875
you really made three million
smackaroos in one day?

348
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,208
You better believe it,
sexy bunny girlies.

349
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,083
I'll even let you stroke
it if you're nice!

350
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,583
It's so gorgeous!

351
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,916
Poopsie, would you mind telling
us how exactly you got it?

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,208
Probably from you
rubbing my chest.

353
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,583
Oh, you mean the money?

354
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,333
I'm a gambler;
I got it from a casino!

355
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,541
A casino!

356
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,375
Of course!

357
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,416
Thank you.

358
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,583
Stop right there!

359
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,166
It's too hard to make
money at a casino!

360
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,833
Nothing personal, but you've
got to have a lot of skill

361
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,625
and talent to make
money as a gambler!

362
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,625
Yeah, nothing
personal, but fuck off.

363
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,500
Stockin' and I have
somewhere to be.

364
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,875
We're getting in on
the action, right?

365
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:03,875
Please, don't do it!

366
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,250
You could end up
losing everything!

367
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,375
I watched a thirteen
hour documentary

368
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,958
on casino slot machines
and tricks of the trade.

369
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,916
These things are designed
to keep you from winning.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You got three sevens
on your first try?

371
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:19,833
Did you see that?

372
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,583
These girls are incredible!

373
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,875
And hot.

374
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,125
I got dibs on the
dark haired one.

375
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,291
She likes bondage.

376
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,750
I've never seen anything
like this before;

377
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,583
you must have a special
angel luck or something.

378
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,250
Maybe some of your
magic will rub off on me!

379
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,458
That five bucks was all
the money I had to my name!

380
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh my. Sorry to alarm you,

381
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,291
but apparently he
was all played out.

382
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,791
Played out patrons
aren't really patrons,

383
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
so we like to have
them forcibly removed.

384
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,125
Harsh.

385
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,708
I doubt you'll have to
worry about that, though;

386
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,750
hopefully we'll both continue to
get lucky as the night goes on.

387
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,083
Perhaps you'd like to
join us for a game

388
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,666
of roulette in the VIP room,

389
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,041
where the stakes are
higher and more private.

390
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,458
So we can get even more?

391
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,458
Definitely.

392
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,791
After you.

393
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,416
Our collection of human money
is progressing smoothly, sister.

394
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,083
Yes, apparently.

395
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,916
Just look at how considerably
our little guy has grown.

396
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,458
As long as he continues
to gorge himself

397
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,166
on that disgusting
Earthly currency,

398
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,125
he'll reach his complete
form which will trigger

399
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,833
the largest financial
meltdown in history,

400
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,916
throwing the human
world into chaos.

401
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know you already know this;
but I like to hear it out loud.

402
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,000
Perhaps that will give us a
chance to redeem ourselves

403
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,166
from what could very well be
the worst debacle of our lives.

404
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,333
Our darling little ghost plant

405
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,333
taken out by that
tawdry pair of angels.

406
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,583
Their detestable images still
flash in my mind, mocking me.

407
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,916
Just like so, with their vulgar
personas and vacuous faces.

408
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,208
What the devil are
they doing in here?

409
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,250
Do you think they might
be attempting to thwart us?

410
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,083
Judging by that
ludicrous expression,

411
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,583
I would venture a "no."

412
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,833
It's far more likely those
obtuse twits are here to gamble.

413
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,208
Then, by all means,
we should take advantage

414
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,250
of this opportunity
to eradicate them.

415
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,791
Collect yourself, Kneesocks.

416
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,708
The last thing we want to give
them is a perfunctory death.

417
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,250
Of course, what was I thinking?

418
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,750
We must pay them triple the
insult they so rudely handed us.

419
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,791
'Tis a Scanty and
Kneesocks rule!

420
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,166
I have a sublime thought.

421
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,791
Since they're already in our
midst, we might as well

422
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,583
provide them with a genuine
gambling experience.

423
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,041
Amazing, Panty. Have you
ever been complimented

424
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,916
on your incredible
skill set before?

425
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
Definitely.

426
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,291
Hey, Panty, we're
supposed to be making

427
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,833
how much for Garter again?

428
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,208
I totally forgot.

429
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,041
Oh, who gives a shit?

430
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,500
Let's have some fuckin' fun.

431
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,750
Ugh.

432
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,083
Goddamnit, why I thought
you'd know is beyond me,

433
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,625
but I'm pretty sure we've
already made our goal.

434
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,958
Awesome!

435
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,666
Now shut your trap and
roulette some shit, okay?!

436
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,750
What the whore said, sir.

437
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,166
I'd like to roulette some shit!

438
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,958
That's the mother
fucking spirit!

439
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,041
Dealer change.

440
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,125
Sugar bear. Your
face is really red.

441
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,125
Are you maybe drunk?

442
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,666
Someone's got Asian hotface.

443
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,708
I do not.

444
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,000
I simply blush
easily, that's all.

445
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,333
Dude, no judgment here.

446
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,541
Now, let's play!

447
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,875
Yes, lets.

448
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,500
Place your bets, please.

449
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,750
Let's make this interesting!

450
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:14,791
No more bets, thank you.

451
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,708
Oh, no.

452
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,875
Well, no one can
win every time.

453
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,666
Good point.

454
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,583
Let's roll again Hotface!

455
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,750
No more bets, thank you.

456
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,000
What a shame.

457
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,041
Hey, I'm just getting started!

458
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,875
Place your bets, please.

459
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,583
No more bets, thank you.

460
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,083
Too bad.

461
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,583
No more bets, thank you.

462
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,875
Shame.

463
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,416
When did the wheel
turn into a cunt?

464
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,583
Seriously, quit fucking around!

465
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,583
Bravo, Kneesocks; bravo!

466
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,375
Continue your assiduous assault
until those hackneyed angels

467
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,166
are broke, shame them
into the depths of despair,

468
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,875
and then annihilate them!

469
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,875
Fuck.

470
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:01,750
Holy fuck.

471
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,208
We don't have any money left.

472
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,666
Checkmate, harpies.

473
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,375
Ah, hell no!

474
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,416
About time we use
our fucking resources.

475
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,041
Hey boys!

476
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,208
One of you wants to
buy this, don't you?

477
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
I'll take it!

478
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,375
My, what a pitiable display.

479
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,916
Over here!

480
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,666
Try this!

481
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,083
And that!

482
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,875
How tediously long do they
intend to keep up this charade?

483
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,291
But, if they continue
to remove their clothing.

484
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,041
They're going to wind up
in the nude, completely.

485
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,041
And without a stitch,
they'll be without a weapon.

486
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,875
This day keeps getting
better and better.

487
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,875
Enjoy this fellas!

488
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,125
Fuck!

489
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,250
Lucky number seven's
it's up to you!

490
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:06,916
Please win!

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,083
Or we'll be naked!

492
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:08,875
Take it off!

493
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,250
Take it off! Take it off!

494
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,125
Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!

495
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,541
Take it off! Take it off!

496
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,083
One more garment left.

497
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,875
Once Panty removes her
panties, they'll be helpless!

498
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,416
Finally!

499
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,416
The fated war betwixt demons
and angels will come to an end!

500
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,916
At the very least,
these angels will perish!

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,250
Hey. Cover up, wouldja?

502
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,375
You're so immodest.

503
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,875
Heh, I'm modestly
freezing my ass off.

504
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,208
We did it!

505
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,625
Fuck yeah; we're back baby!

506
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,916
Whoo!

507
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,958
Shit.

508
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,541
No fair.

509
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,083
Kay.

510
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:57,916
What the hell is that thing?

511
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,833
I think it might be a ghost.

512
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,416
This day just gets
better and better.

513
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,750
Let's kill this mother fucker
and earn some Heaven coins, too!

514
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,708
That was mortifying,
absolutely wretched!

515
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,958
Remove us from
this hellish place!

516
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,250
Toodle-oo, imbeciles!

517
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,583
You stupid bitches!

518
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,583
Tell me you are not
responsible for this!

519
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,458
Hell yeah we are.

520
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,791
Dude, twisted fucks will pay
anything for random shit.

521
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,083
You idiots!

522
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,166
Have you no shame?

523
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,458
Those are sacred
weapons from Heaven!

524
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,125
You should sell your
skid marked business too.

525
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,291
Here.

526
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,625
Three million.

527
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,458
I can't take your filthy
dirty, coochie cover cash!

528
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,958
Quit being a drama queen!

529
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,208
That cash didn't come close
to my snatch, ya sick fuck!

530
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,708
What?!

531
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:57,916
The price keeps going up!

532
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,583
Twenty thousand more!

533
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,583
I have to!

534
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,833
I can't let anyone
else have them.

535
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,541
I've gotta protect Panty
or something like that.
