1
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,375
"Lez Diaboliques."

2
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,583
It's "Lay", Panty.

3
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,541
Oh, okay.

4
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,416
Les Diaboliques!

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,291
Ugh! Can a sister
get paid, for realz?

6
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,458
Right?

7
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,000
How many of these
fuckers have we killed?

8
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,291
Way more than the shit change
we've been getting for 'em.

9
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,291
Dude, Little Miss Garter
was full of shit.

10
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,750
Easy money, my hot ass.

11
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,416
Not that I mind
being completely bored

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,125
all goddamn day
in a high school,

13
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,708
but I mind being completely
bored all goddamn day

14
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,416
in a high school.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,541
I mean, Jesus.

16
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,083
Remember when
killing ghosts was fun?

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,791
It's like whenever I do anal,

18
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,875
great in theory but
so not worth the pain.

19
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,333
Too much information.

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,208
It'd be different if
I was having some fun.

21
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,375
But these ghosts are lame.

22
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,791
Lame-O!

23
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
Hello, screamer!

24
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,708
Now, that's more like it!

25
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,958
Okay this guy is pathetic.

26
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,458
I don't know if he
should count as a ghost.

27
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,500
I don't give a shit as long
as it knows how to holler.

28
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,125
That's what she said!

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,708
Ew. That was gross.

30
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,583
You asked for it.

31
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,375
Having fun yet?

32
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,375
Fuck that.

33
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,458
I'm not sticking
my fist in there.

34
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,833
Not often you get to say that.

35
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,500
Well played, hooker.

36
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,791
By the way,
bitches, I'm a girl!

37
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,291
Oh no you di'n't!

38
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,625
You asked for it, shit stain!

39
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,166
Eat toilet!

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,958
Damnit!

41
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,541
She got away!

42
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,541
What kind of fucked up
asshole hides in toilets?

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
This sucks balls bad.

44
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,125
How can it already be morning?

45
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,166
Hey, so, uh, why aren't
you guys wearing uniforms?

46
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,750
You must always
wear proper attire.

47
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,791
"Proper attire?" Are we
fucking at a prom or something?

48
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,291
Dude it's not our rule.

49
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,083
The new school queens told
us to start wearing uniforms.

50
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,125
What?

51
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,416
We're the school queens, dick.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,666
Yeah, not anymore, babe.

53
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,166
If you're planning
to live past today,

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,833
then you two should probably
go home and change clothes.

55
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,750
Maybe this is some
sort of bad prank.

56
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,250
You know how desperate
they are for our attention.

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,500
Geek Boy! What's the deal?

58
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,958
Uh, what ever could you mean?

59
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,416
Sounds like these Daemon
Sisters are a piece of work.

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,833
All their nazi morality rules

61
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,833
and terrorist uniforms
make me wanna gag.

62
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,500
Yeah but they're
the mayor's daughters,

63
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,166
so ya know, they do what they
want and no one says anything.

64
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,500
What? Stop the car.

65
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,083
Okay what kind of morals
are we talking about here?

66
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,375
Like can't text in class or
like we can't give blow jobs

67
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,625
or hardcore finger
bang each other

68
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,416
under the lunch table anymore?

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
What the hell kind of
fucking school is this?

70
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,333
Everyone freak out!

71
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,791
The Daemon Sisters are here!

72
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,333
Shit!

73
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,208
It's Scanty!

74
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,750
Don't forget about Kneesocks!

75
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,791
Hail to Miss Scanty.

76
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,541
And also to Miss Kneesocks!

77
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,250
Oh my heavens,
Kneesocks, is it just me

78
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,416
or do you also sense a musky
irregularity in the air?

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,875
Indeed, sister.

80
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,666
It appears we have two
unregistered girls

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,291
with us at school today.

82
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,500
Well, they certainly have
horrible taste in perfume.

83
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,333
Why would anyone
wear that fragrance?

84
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,458
Smells ammonia based;
like cat urine.

85
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,333
Oh, how silly of us.

86
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,250
I think they simply
forgot to wipe.

87
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,541
Bitch!

88
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,875
We hear you've been
bossing around our slaves.

89
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,666
You can't come in here
and take over our school.

90
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,875
That's bullshit!

91
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,083
Did that weasel just
lay a threat upon us?

92
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,666
I think they might be hoodlums.

93
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,541
Hoodlums?

94
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,791
What's that?

95
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,708
They're trying to say
we're ghetto, which is

96
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,291
a crock of shit!
They're the ones

97
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,500
who are fucking up the school
with their so-called rules!

98
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,333
Hell yeah!

99
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,666
We have the right to party!

100
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,166
Try to keep up, ninnywits.

101
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,750
This is a lesson on
how the moral climate

102
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,916
in this academy has
plunged drastically!

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,208
You call it freedom,
but it's a perverse anarchy!

104
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,750
The only way to return
this pathetic school

105
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,125
to the standards of which
it's fully capable is simple.

106
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,541
We rule it!

107
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,083
Give students a new sense
of respect through rules!

108
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,083
Wearing school uniforms keeps
them focused on scholarship!

109
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,458
We, as leaders, bestow upon
them a new sense of self worth!

110
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,500
I adore the sound of it
coming from your mouth!

111
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,083
Rules keep behavior in check!

112
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,583
Suppression keeps thoughts in
check and physical training

113
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,000
keeps them from looking
like fat enchiladas!

114
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,208
These things bring about
perfection and beauty!

115
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:54,750
Yes. Yes.

116
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,000
Calm down, dear.

117
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:56,875
Your face is terrifically
red at the moment.

118
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh goodness how embarrassing.

119
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,958
I'm too fragile; I blush easily.

120
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:04,291
But wait, your faces
are both red all the time.

121
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,125
Oh no! They don't
mean anything by it!

122
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,333
They must've just stayed
up all night last night!

123
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,541
Ew, what the fuck is
going on in my mouth?

124
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,708
Nasty.

125
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:15,916
Blame the Daemon Sisters
for that one, too.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,375
They're making everyone
eat healthy sludge.

127
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,791
What kind of
hippie shit is this?

128
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,916
There's not even cake.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,291
Who doesn't have cake at lunch?

130
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,083
Fuck cake, we need
ketchup or mustard

131
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,500
or hot sauce or even
jizz to jazz this shit up.

132
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,875
If I don't carb up I'm gonna
pass the fuck out, am I right?

133
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,458
Oh yeah. Definitely
sleepy town.

134
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,625
No! We can't quit until

135
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,916
we give them an ass-kicking
they won't ever never forget!

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,708
You rhymed!

137
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,041
Fuck, they're here.

138
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:41,666
Great.

139
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,666
Please kill me.

140
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,250
Well, look at what we have here.

141
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,958
It's the Toilet Sisters.

142
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,041
You troglodytes might want to
be mindful of over saucing;

143
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,583
you don't want your bellies
to turn to jelly, do you?

144
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,958
Ugly and fat are no longer
tolerated at this school.

145
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,750
It's against the
new rules, you see.

146
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,166
Allow me to recommend
some calorie control.

147
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,625
Look at us. It's
how we've managed

148
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,291
to keep our figures
perfectly extraordinary.

149
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,458
Oh, have you heard this
delicious new rumor?

150
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,291
Apparently, there are
two genuine angels

151
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,416
attending this
academy as we speak.

152
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,958
It's said they spend their time
on Earth vanquishing ghosts!

153
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:12,625
Indeed.

154
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,041
Sisters, even.

155
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,916
Now, wait a minute,
you and I are sisters.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,875
They couldn't possibly
mean us, could they?

157
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,125
Don't be ridiculous.

158
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,083
No, you're right.

159
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,958
Who could ever call us angels?

160
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,166
Otherworldly, fulminating
and impeccable perhaps,

161
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,208
but there's no way
that rumor is about us!

162
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,250
How scandalous!

163
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,500
Agreed!

164
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,833
I've heard these parasites
manage to destroy

165
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,875
everything in their path,
like chemical warfare.

166
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,208
Or gonorrhea.

167
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,500
I think that's the
blond one specifically.

168
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,000
We may need to issue rubber
gloves and masks.

169
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,291
I feel just awful for
the other creature.

170
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,875
You know, the fleshy one.

171
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,916
That's it!

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,083
Who are the hell are
you calling fleshy?

173
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,958
I gave up fat like
ten ghosts ago!

174
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,958
And what in Christ's name
is wrong with being an angel?

175
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,375
Oh, like you're so
much better than us?

176
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,375
"Hi, our daddy's the mayor,
and we're full of shit!"

177
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,875
Yeah what she said!

178
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,708
If you want to rule the school
let's do this shit right!

179
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,375
Oh.

180
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,541
You're still there.

181
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,750
Well, that certainly
explains the smell.

182
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,625
Hold on.

183
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,250
What were your names again?

184
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,500
Potty and Cellulite, right?

185
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,916
I'm gonna rearrange your face!

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Your vociferous ramblings
are becoming incoherent.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,166
You are so about to lose
some short and curlies!

188
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,500
Explain the purpose of
this embroilment, please?

189
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,833
Uh, what?

190
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,208
Yes, what are the parameters?

191
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,541
Per-- wha?

192
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,250
We see you want to
fight, but for what?

193
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,833
To determine the school's
leaders, perhaps?

194
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,666
In that case.

195
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,250
This won't take too long.

196
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,250
That's right!

197
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,250
This is bad! This is bad!

198
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,125
Or are you having
second thoughts?

199
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,291
Shall we commence?

200
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,083
We'll permit the first
challenge to be your decision.

201
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,333
Let's see.

202
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,500
Manners, perhaps?

203
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,250
Boo!

204
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:40,833
Beauty?

205
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:41,666
Boo!

206
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,416
Gracefulness?

207
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,250
Boo!

208
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,000
Physical proportion?

209
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:44,833
Boo!

210
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,500
Status?

211
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:45,958
Boo!

212
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:46,375
Education?

213
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,041
Boo!

214
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:47,541
Eyesight?

215
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,041
Boo!

216
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:48,625
Audibility?

217
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,750
Boo!

218
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,416
It seems unfair, though.

219
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,041
We're already
superior in everything,

220
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,583
so I don't understand how
they're going to challenge us.

221
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,958
What do angels do--save
lives and blow horns?

222
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,458
How cute.

223
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,583
I have an inkling blowing
is the tawdry one's specialty.

224
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,625
Bitch!

225
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,125
Don't you judge
my blowjob skills!

226
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,666
So you know, I was
ranked 69 on BJ dot cum!

227
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,666
Panty stop, you're
making it worse!

228
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,333
By the way, we
win automatically.

229
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
Why fight when that's
one of our new rules?

230
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,208
There, are you happy?

231
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,541
Our time has been pilfered and
you've nothing to show for it!

232
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,000
We are still in
charge of this school!

233
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
We're intelligent
and pulchritudinous,

234
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,666
and the students here
will always worship us!

235
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,583
This is getting tedious.

236
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,416
See you two next fall.

237
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,166
Whose garbage disposal
did we just jump down?

238
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,416
This is fucking nasty.

239
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,375
I think we might be in hell.

240
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,500
Look at all the homeless people.

241
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,458
Smells like ass.

242
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,916
Hi Panty!

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,583
Good morning!

244
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,625
Weird.

245
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,791
You try to fight
them too, geek wad?

246
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,833
No, of course not.

247
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,083
They just sent
you to Loser's Lair.

248
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,333
It's where they send people

249
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,458
when no one else wants
to hang out with them.

250
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,291
Oh, great.

251
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,833
Yeah, that makes it better.

252
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,250
Well since you're new and stuff,
I'm an excellent tour guide.

253
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,083
Color me black and
white and so surprised.

254
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,375
What are you doing here?

255
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,375
Hey.

256
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,375
I fucking killed you!

257
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,416
Oh come on.

258
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,041
Panty. Is that the
best you can do?

259
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,250
How 'bout how are you?

260
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,625
And 'what a nice
thought--we don't have

261
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,000
to rot alone in the
smelly spunk junk!'

262
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,750
First of all, that
laugh is annoying.

263
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,291
Second of all, we're
not moving in here.

264
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,375
How the hell are you
still alive, anyway?

265
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,083
Please girls, let me be.

266
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

267
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,875
Nope. Too late.

268
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:42,916
We're pissed now.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,083
Please don't kill me!

270
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,208
I know things about
the Daemon sisters.

271
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,750
I promise to share!

272
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,166
I know you care!

273
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,333
Talk.

274
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,041
Free me first!

275
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,625
That's the deal.

276
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,375
Tada!

277
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,791
Plunge on in, me uglies!

278
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not jumping in a shit hole!

279
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,791
Don't be a bum,
it's actually fun!

280
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,541
What's fun about
sliding down a toilet!

281
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,458
Just close your eyes and
throw yourself into it.

282
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,833
Pretend that it's
watersports; you'll be fine.

283
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,041
This is different.

284
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,708
Yeah, we don't have
a jet ski or anything.

285
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,041
Don't forget your rubbers!

286
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
So, whaddaya think?

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,583
This is it!

288
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,333
This is what?

289
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,375
Curiouser and curiouser.

290
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,333
Fuck me!

291
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,041
Is this a ghost factory?

292
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:34,916
Worm!

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,166
What are you doing?

294
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,625
Sending pics to Garter
so he knows what's up.

295
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,541
You have his number now?

296
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,041
You guys are
sexting aren't you?

297
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,166
Figures.

298
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,083
Oh, hey, man. This is Brief.

299
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,208
That thing is a ghost plant!

300
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,041
You must destroy it immediately!

301
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,541
They'll all activate if you
don't hurry your ass up!

302
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,958
Ugh.

303
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,583
Hard to get motivated when
you're surrounded by shit.

304
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,250
Look what's happening
at the top of the plant!

305
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,708
That's a Ghost Stone!

306
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,583
It collects all the nasty bits
of evil from human souls

307
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,958
and then uses them
to mass produce

308
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,125
some serious asshole ghosts.

309
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,375
Dicks!

310
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,750
So that means we have to
destroy the entire plant

311
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,041
if we want to get rid of them.

312
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,166
Give that boy a sticker!

313
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,791
The fuck?

314
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,666
I want a sticker!

315
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
Keep your eyes open!

316
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,250
There's only one team of baddies
that can use the Ghost Stones!

317
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,791
Which means they must be
behind this mother fuckery!

318
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,583
Yeah, who's they?

319
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,625
We don't understand you.

320
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,208
What the?

321
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,500
Oh holy hell!

322
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,708
Why?

323
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,541
Well look at what
the fat cat threw up.

324
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,000
If it isn't everyone's
favorite rancid sewer rats.

325
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,458
Oh, I'm sorry,
I meant Toilet Angels.

326
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,708
How disappointing.

327
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,458
You should know by now
this area is off limits.

328
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,541
Uh, hi excuse me.

329
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,041
What happened to
your rules and morals?

330
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,625
This looks like
pretty shady business.

331
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,625
What are you hagalicious
whore bags hiding?

332
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,750
I'd be delighted to
explain things to you.

333
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,208
What you are observing,
my little unctuous troll,

334
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,458
is the headquarters to a
very crucial undertaking.

335
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,500
We took our experiment
for a test drive yesterday

336
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,458
and are now implementing mass
production beginning forthwith.

337
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,458
Soon enough, you revolting
malodorous angels

338
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,791
will be unable to surmount
any ghosts you encounter,

339
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,000
due to sheer volume!

340
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,541
Tis only a matter of time

341
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,500
until this Earthly realm is just
pervaded with ghosts!

342
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,958
Did you drink a
thesaurus this morning?

343
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,416
I don't know what you're saying.

344
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,291
Not that we don't support
your little dreams and all.

345
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,458
But I really need
some chocolate,

346
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,916
so we're gonna go ahead
and kill you now.

347
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,500
O, pitiful shadows
lost in the darkness.

348
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,083
O, evil spirits born of those

349
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,791
drifting between
Heaven and Earth.

350
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,666
May the thunderous
power from the garments

351
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,583
of these holy, delicate
maidens shatter your ill will

352
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,875
and loathsome impurity and
return you from whence you came.

353
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,208
Repent motherfuckers!

354
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,000
That was so kick ass!

355
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,333
Those recalcitrant little
popinjays just will not give up.

356
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,500
Sister, I believe it's
time for us to give them

357
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,291
a schooling and sometimes
the most inestimable lessons

358
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
are the most laborious.

359
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,500
True.

360
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,083
Shall we, Scanty?

361
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,875
Break, O Earth.

362
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,625
Dry up, O Sea.

363
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,833
Burn out, O Sun.

364
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:21,208
Grant us power, Earthly leaders
and gate keepers of Hell.

365
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,875
Guide us, makers
of the underworld!

366
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,041
We are high-class
demon commanders!

367
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,333
I'm Scanty!

368
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,833
And I'm her darling
little sister, Kneesocks.

369
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,583
Fastener!

370
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:32,916
You're shitting me!

371
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,041
They're like for real demons?

372
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,583
Well fuck me in the keyhole.

373
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,708
Oh, great and beautiful
demon princesses!

374
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,375
Forgive me!

375
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm at your service!

376
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,916
I have no idea who
those creatures are

377
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,416
but they shoved me down
a toilet and make

378
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,750
me speak in awful rhymes!

379
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,291
What?

380
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,541
Check it out!

381
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the happy freedom dance!

382
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,416
Too bad you didn't catch me
while you had the chance!

383
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,416
All ghosts must be
trained and disciplined

384
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
before they can be
useful on our missions.

385
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
Helena Bonham Carter!

386
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,625
After this I get chocolate.
After this I get chocolate.

387
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,250
Attack!

388
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,458
What?

389
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh shit! I'm hit!

390
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,875
What?
Half a coin!

391
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,958
That's angel abuse!

392
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,250
Fuckin' A and
predictable, like them.

393
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,500
Panty, is it?

394
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,875
Let me share something
I've learned with you.

395
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,958
It's sweet to believe
good will always prevail,

396
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,666
but Scanty and I are demons.

397
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,583
And by design, we're
impossible to defeat.

398
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,833
This is about to get so
embarrassing for you.

399
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,583
By design, we're about
to kick your demon asses.

400
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,708
I'munna laugh my ass off.

401
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,500
Let's get it over with.

402
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,333
Girl, you ain't
gotta tell me twice.

403
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,750
 Bring it!

404
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,875
Let's do this!

405
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,458
I think you guys are
going about this all wrong.

406
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,208
Isn't the point to
try to get the stone?

407
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,916
Oh yeah, that does
make more sense.

408
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,958
It's gone!

409
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,708
Holy stink!

410
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,541
Why'd I smell it?

411
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,125
It's an army of artificial
dark night ghosts!

412
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,958
What the fuck are you doing?

413
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,750
Get out of here! Run!

414
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,666
Oh no you don't!

415
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,291
Where are you going?

416
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,250
Then the other girl, her friend,

417
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,208
I don't remember her name,
she just stuck it in her mouth

418
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,416
and kept it there
the whole time!

419
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,916
So I just went
at it like "Yeah!"

420
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
Sorry! I didn't see anything!

421
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,333
Oh yeah.

422
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,916
He was hung like a thimble.

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,541
I didn't feel anything but from
the photos you couldn't tell.

424
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,416
He kept taking pictures
from this angle

425
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
that made it look hu--!

426
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,250
You sure do know your way
around a toilet, don't you?

427
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,541
I never knew there were
so many different exits.

428
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,958
Hey, you're the one who likes
to hang out in the sewer.

429
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,583
Fuck, I just do my
business and go.

430
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,375
Okay, Brief, you can do this.

431
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,916
Just be rational:
What would Indiana Jones do?

432
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,166
This is taking too long.

433
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,291
You're so dramatic.

434
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,916
Get in the car.

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,750
No, it's okay you
don't have to do that.

436
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,916
I'll be fine.

437
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,625
Well, then ya better
get out of the way.

438
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,458
Are you okay?

439
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,541
No!

440
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,208
Why won't you die?

441
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,416
I should be safe
here for awhile.

442
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,083
There you are!

443
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,875
No!

444
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,250
Give me the stone!

445
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,250
Yo.

446
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,708
Last chance, darling.

447
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,916
You may have the stone
but do you have the stones?

448
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,375
Hello there.

449
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,791
I wouldn't come any closer.

450
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,916
But feel free to test us.

451
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,166
Nothing would
make me happier than

452
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,291
to destroy your mingy
rodent boyfriend here.

453
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,458
Yeah, like I give a shit.

454
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,166
Do whatever you want
with that turd pie.

455
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,541
Maybe he'll distract you.

456
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,500
Make it easier for us to
stomp your sunburned asses.

457
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,958
Panty, please don't!

458
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,083
You'd sacrifice your friend
for your own perseverance?

459
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:28,875
You're angels!

460
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,041
Uh huh.

461
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,875
We're also tired,
irritated and over it.

462
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,083
Stockin's fucking jonesin'

463
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,958
and she can't eat until
you two are tits up.

464
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,833
I guess that means
killing Geek Wad, too!

465
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:37,958
Been fun, kid!

466
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,333
At least say my real
name before I die!

467
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,750
You two are the most
disgusting creatures!

468
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,583
What angel
doesn't have morals?

469
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,708
Hello?

470
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,708
This is your friend
I'm about to kill!

471
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,208
You're kinda supposed to care!

472
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,583
Uh, no.

473
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,958
But straddle his face
and give him a last meal.

474
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,916
How dare you,
you rancorous whore!

475
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,833
What the French toast?

476
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,333
Nerd Bomber! The stone!

477
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,875
Here!

478
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,625
Total spinner!

479
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,000
My dick!

480
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,083
I'm a size queen. So wha---!

481
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,250
Don't get too comfortable.

482
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,541
That was simply a warm-up.

483
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,958
We'll let you off the
hook and call it a draw!

484
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,000
But only because we're late
for an important appointment!

485
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,250
Don't think it's
because we're finished

486
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,708
with you gross parasites.

487
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,791
Keep practicing
because we'll be back!

488
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, I think we handled
that like pros, don't you?

489
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,875
And I mean who doesn't wanna
watch their school explode?

490
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,083
Yo, Ginger Crust.

491
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,333
You did a good job today.

492
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,791
Speaking of which,

493
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,791
why don't you come here and
let me give you a reward.

494
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,333
Huh?

495
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Like what?

496
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,125
Oh don't be such
a fuckin' prude.

497
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,208
You know what I mean.

498
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,375
Drop trou' and climb up.

499
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,750
What? You can't be serious!

500
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,291
That's not how it works, is it?

501
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,458
I haven't even been tested yet!

502
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,000
And you probably haven't either!

503
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,791
And shouldn't we hold hands
or kiss or fall in love first?

504
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,166
I mean, I would love for my
first time to be with you but--

505
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,000
Jesus!

506
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,166
I'll just find someone else.

507
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,916
Way to fuck it up, pansy.

508
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,416
I've never been more ashamed.

509
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,958
How are we ever
going to marry you off?

510
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,083
But I--

511
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,500
Tripping up against
a lesser opponent

512
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,708
out of sheer carelessness.

513
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,458
Scanty and Kneesocks,
you have failed me.

514
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,666
We beg of your
forgiveness, Mr. Mayor.

515
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,708
The plan was to extend your
influence inside and out.

516
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,125
But it was too much
for you, wasn't it?

517
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,708
You've given me no choice.

518
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,583
I've prepared a punishment
apropos to your failure today.

519
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,375
Please sir.

520
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,708
Don't send us back there!

521
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,250
Oh!

522
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,708
It smells abhorrent down here!

523
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,083
I think I just swallowed
something fecal!

524
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,333
I'm going to be ill!

525
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:50,000
Still, what imprudent
angels they are.

526
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,875
Of course, I'd
expect nothing less

527
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,666
from creatures raised by
that imbecile, Garterbelt.

528
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,250
Yes.

529
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,500
It appears that the real
fun is about to begin.
