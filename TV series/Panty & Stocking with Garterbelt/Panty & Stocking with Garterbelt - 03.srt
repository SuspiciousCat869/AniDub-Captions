1
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,125
"Catfight Club."

2
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,458
Siblings.

3
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,833
They don't always look the same.
They don't always act the same,

4
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,083
and they certainly
don't always have

5
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,666
the same taste
in the opposite sex.

6
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,708
Or the same sex, depending.

7
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,125
Friends are the
family you choose.

8
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,791
Siblings are the strangers
with whom you live.

9
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,875
Understandably, they tend to
argue over insignificancies.

10
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,666
The closer they get,
the more they clash.

11
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,583
It is the way of things.

12
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,291
At least until they
grow up, that is.

13
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:36,541
Shit!

14
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,458
Goddamnit!

15
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,750
Not here! Not here!

16
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,833
Not here!

17
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,958
No!

18
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,000
My hangover is saying
you're too fucking loud.

19
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,833
I mean, unless you're
like missing your period.

20
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:48,833
That would suck.

21
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,666
My pudding is gone, you twat!

22
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,250
Pudding!

23
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,041
It's special ordered from Heaven
and has a 500-year waiting list!

24
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,041
Damn it!

25
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,458
That pudding is legendary!

26
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,583
And?

27
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,750
Oh my God, you
ate it, didn't you?

28
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,083
Ahouwoh...

29
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,958
Don't "ahouwoh" me!
It was either you or Chuck!

30
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,208
Uh, why would you
just assume it was me?

31
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,291
What?

32
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,958
I'm not assuming;
I know it was you.

33
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh, wait, you're talking
about pudding, right?

34
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,458
Yeah, I guess I did eat that;
but it was disgusting.

35
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,666
Sugary as shit.

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,291
Motherbitch, I knew it!

37
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,250
It's pudding, Panty!

38
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,041
You knew it was gonna be sweet!

39
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:20,916
What the crap?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,583
Okay, you need to relax, chica.

41
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,375
It's called pudding,
not the end of the world.

42
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,708
Jesus!

43
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,958
You always have to fuck up
everything, don't you?

44
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,583
This is my room!

45
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,333
Yours looks like a
hoarder's asshole exploded.

46
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,666
Look at your toilet!

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,791
Look at your bathtub!

48
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,166
Look at what you put
in your mouth,

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,541
and I'm not just
talking about dick!

50
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,416
You're nothing but a
filthy ho-baggin' thief!

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,875
Remember that time
when I told you to relax?

52
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,958
You need some
inner fucking peace.

53
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,625
I do not understand how
I could ever be related to you.

54
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,625
Try these.

55
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,833
I'll let you steal
some of my food

56
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,250
if that'll make you
feel better, we cool?

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,333
Look, hooker, I'm trying
to be fucking nice here.

58
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,958
You know I don't
like spicy food!

59
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,708
You do realize that if you
only ever eat sweet shit,

60
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,583
you're gonna end up
a Fatty McFatterson.

61
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,750
Whatever.

62
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,458
Here's a newsflash,
Flatty McFlatterson.

63
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,208
All the weight I gain
goes straight to my boobs,

64
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,625
and I am okay with that.

65
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,583
Yeah, and your nipples are
the size of dinner plates.

66
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,458
Mine are small, fierce, and,
oh God, are they sensitive.

67
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,166
Like guys freak out
over your titters.

68
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,833
I say titters because
your boobs are so small

69
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,916
they actually make me laugh.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
It's cool.

71
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
Your tits keep you from looking
like a little girl; I get it.

72
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,666
Then when he gives you candy,

73
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,791
you won't feel like you're
hooking up with a pedophile.

74
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,250
You mean like that
idiotic muscle head,

75
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,125
piece of shit you keep
on the back burner?

76
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,375
Oh, by the way, I diddled him.

77
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,875
I diddled him, real hard.

78
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,791
And he said I was the
best fuck he had ever had.

79
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,125
Way better than you.

80
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,750
Not that he should procreate.

81
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,791
But I would totally
have his abortion.

82
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,208
Well, I fucked that masochist
freak you like so much!

83
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,500
He was tiny and awful,
so heads up, Buttercup.

84
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,875
His fat ass was all jiggly,

85
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,750
just like your fancy
pudding and giant skin sacks.

86
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,666
Keep your mouth off my things!

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,791
Likewise, bitch!

88
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,666
Hey, Panty, how's
it goin' and all that;

89
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,166
I hope I'm not
bothering you two.

90
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,083
Your father here was nice
enough to show me the scenic way

91
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,333
to your room through his
bedroom, which was lovely.

92
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,916
He is a very
affectionate large man.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,083
Now don't forget.

94
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm single and looking
for some mingling.

95
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,083
Angels!

96
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,333
Another mandate has arrived!

97
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,375
Get your lazy asses to
the scene immediately.

98
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,625
All right,
this the part where

99
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,166
you're supposed to
get the fuck up!

100
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,250
No way.

101
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen, Garter.

102
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,250
Agh! Holy shit! What now?

103
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,208
Sonofabitch!

104
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,791
You heard what I said!

105
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,166
I'm not going anywhere with that
goddamn, waste of space whore!

106
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,416
Who the fuck are
you calling a whore?

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,708
Hey, fuck off, cunt bag!

108
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm so fucking over you!

109
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,250
Quit copying me!

110
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,666
Come on, Chuck; we're leaving.

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,916
We don't need that slutty
ass heap of trash anyway.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
Yeah, well, that's
fine by me, sugar tits.

113
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,083
I don't need you
either, and besides,

114
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,833
I would rather hang out
with Geek Boy here

115
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,708
than you any day
of the fucking week!

116
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't fuck with me, asshole.

117
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,041
Don't fuck with <i>me</i> , asshole.

118
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,458
Uh, hey, were you being serious?

119
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,708
Do you really wanna
hang out with me?

120
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,541
Huh?

121
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,375
Who the fuck is this dork?

122
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,375
First things first:
we gotta have a new title.

123
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,791
I think we should go with
something like Panty and Virgin.

124
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,875
Yeah, but my name
is actually Brief.

125
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,250
No, that's way too obvious.

126
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,791
How about Panty and Foreskin?

127
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,125
That's an awful word,
no thank you!

128
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,791
Oh, I know! Panty and Smegma.

129
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,791
You're messing with me
on purpose, aren't you?

130
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,291
She is such a
selfish little hag.

131
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,625
I mean, who the hell eats stuff
with someone else's name on it?

132
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
Talk about rude.

133
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,958
Seriously.

134
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,958
She doesn't give a shit
about anything

135
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,000
other than
filling her cock coozie.

136
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,291
I cannot believe
she fucking drove off

137
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,458
with See Through like that.

138
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,166
Um, Panty?

139
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,250
Don't you think you
should go with her, maybe?

140
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,708
I mean she's all by herself;
anything could happen to her.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,708
Oh, God! No! Please don't!

142
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,000
Please don't what, asswipe?

143
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:05,958
Fuckin' A!

144
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,333
We have arrived.

145
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,458
Hey, Garter.

146
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,750
I'm at the scene now.

147
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,250
Perfect.

148
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,333
I've just identified the bastard
ghost you're looking for.

149
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,708
Be careful; this one's tricky.

150
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,041
It uses girls to-- 

151
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,208
Listen, hooch.

152
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,625
If you apologize,
I might come out there

153
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,375
and help you not make
a giant fail of yourself.

154
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,750
That bitch!

155
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,458
Bitch! Fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch!

156
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,041
Fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!

157
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,416
Help! Somebody!

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,416
A wolf is trying to attack me!

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,666
Oh, please help!

160
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,166
There's a mean wolf
trying to attack me,

161
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,833
and I think
it might be evil!

162
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,541
I wonder if that's what
Garter was trying to say

163
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,291
about girls
before he got cut off.

164
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,166
That has to be it! I bet
there's a big bad wolf

165
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,750
attacking poor,
frightened girls.

166
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,000
Where is this jack off, sweetie?

167
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,083
He's right down there!

168
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:56,875
Follow me!

169
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,000
He's not too far ahead!

170
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,333
I'm right behind you!

171
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,666
I can solve
this case on my own;

172
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,916
I don't need that
drunken blowjob!

173
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:09,083
Oh no! It's him!

174
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,416
Get ready, dick munch.

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,958
You're dealing with the
awesomazing Stocking now,

176
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,458
so start saying your
goddamn prayers!

177
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,583
Aren't you one of
those damn

178
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,125
Panty and Stocking
Anarchy sisters?

179
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,916
What the hell do
you want with us?

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,083
Who's 'us'?

181
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,583
Darling, he's speaking
of himself and me;

182
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,666
we share one mind
and one body.

183
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,791
We're the same ghost.

184
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,750
That's right! I lure
in the pervy men,

185
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
and he scams 'em
outta their money!

186
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,083
We are huge fans of money!

187
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,958
Who still falls
for that bullshit?

188
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,166
Hold on, what did
Garter's clue say?

189
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,500
God mother damn it!

190
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,375
Rope was being literal!

191
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,625
Heave the ho! Heave the ho!
Heave the ho! Heave the ho!

192
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,333
I can't breathe.

193
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,208
God, I'm starting
to get into this.

194
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,083
Why don't you goblins yank
that rope like you mean...

195
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,625
Looks like we've caught
us one nympho angel!

196
00:07:55,708 --> 00:08:01,625
Get ready to die, dear!

197
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,375
Quit your cryin' Geek Boy.

198
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,708
We've got asshole
ghosts to kill!

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,750
Bitches, I don't have time
for all this motherfuckery!

200
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,750
Why the prick did
you have to show up?

201
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,083
I was enjoying myself!

202
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,000
Aw. The sisters are
reunited at long last!

203
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,375
Now you two can die together!

204
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,416
Will you stop it
with this random

205
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
hissy fit bullshit already?

206
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,083
Will you stop it with this
random selfish bullshit?

207
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,333
And here I thought all
the shit would have been

208
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,583
fucked out of you by now.

209
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,916
Why'nchu say that again!

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,416
"That again," Whoreopolis!

211
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,708
It's impolite to chat when
I'm trying to fucking kill you!

212
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,708
Here I come!

213
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
You shot at me.

214
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,291
Wow.

215
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,250
I am so sorry about that.

216
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,541
My gun must've slipped.

217
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,416
Jesus!

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,833
You are such a heartless whore!

219
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,916
Suck on this.

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,958
Oh, wow.

221
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,875
I'm sorry; my sword
must've slipped.

222
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,583
Slipped, my fine, hot ass!

223
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,250
I told you.

224
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,916
Don't fuck with me!

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,875
Don't fuck with <i>me</i> !

226
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,250
Stop fighting!

227
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,750
Can't we all just get along?

228
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,000
Sisters should treat each other
with love and generosit--!

229
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,541
You want some of this?

230
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,000
Herpes or Chlamydia?

231
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
Fuck you with a shovel!

232
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,458
You keep talking, but
all I hear is syphilis!

233
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,458
Fuck you!

234
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,958
I simply cannot fathom why
they continue ignoring us.

235
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,833
Me either!

236
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,875
Your pussy fight is
making you total pussies!

237
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,958
This is all your fault!

238
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,291
No it's not.

239
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,541
This is because you won't
fucking apologize to me!

240
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,625
What?

241
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
Don't blame me
because you're greedy!

242
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,625
This is very upsetting.

243
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,666
I hate it when families argue.

244
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,458
Shut up, ya vag!

245
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,583
I do not comprehend the fear
these two evoke from people.

246
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,208
Me neither, because they suck.

247
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,666
I mean, it's totally like
Panty and Stocking who?

248
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,500
I believe we have
officially surpassed

249
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,416
the strongest team, myself.

250
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,916
Yeah! Those anarchy
bitches are toast!

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,625
Hey, Panty?

252
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
What is it, Stockin'?

253
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,791
Are you thinking what
I'm thinking right now?

254
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,291
Of course I am.

255
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,083
I mean, we are sisters.

256
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,125
So then.

257
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,875
Temporary truce?

258
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,875
Fuck yeah.

259
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,625
Temporary truce it is.

260
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,708
Let's kill 'em!

261
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,791
Shit! This time
you're going down.

262
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,958
Die!

263
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,833
Panty's strength!

264
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,041
Stocking's technique!

265
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,958
Separate they are strong enough,

266
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,666
but their power
can only truly shine

267
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,583
when they are working
together as one!

268
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,666
They are Panty and Stocking!

269
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,291
Can you believe--

270
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,208
I did both these voices?

271
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,375
I'm a badass.

272
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,291
As the good Lord says,
"You are also my friend.

273
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,625
I have been and
always shall be yours."

274
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,875
Actually, I think that's Spock.

275
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,041
You riding with us, Geek Boy?

276
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,208
You mean it?

277
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,333
Ain't no thing.

278
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
I'll make sure he gets home.

279
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,500
Okay.

280
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Whatever chaps your ass.

281
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,541
Wait!

282
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,791
Come back, please!

283
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,833
You want to grab a bite
to eat on our way home?

284
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,875
I think the Bear
Club buffet still on.

285
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,416
Just try it once;
I know you'll love it.

286
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,166
Oh, God!

287
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,916
So, uh...

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,875
Here.

289
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,166
Where did you get this?

290
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,666
Did you spend
your Heavens on it?

291
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,041
I'm not saying I did;
I'm not saying I didn't!

292
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,541
Oh.

293
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,208
You bitch.

294
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,291
You cunt.

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,750
"Pulp Addiction."

296
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
Portschach's journal.

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
July 2nd.

298
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,083
Early morning.

299
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,708
0600 hours.

300
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,916
Fierce storm.

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,333
Freezing temperatures.

302
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,416
These are the annals of war.

303
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm desperate for this
bitter engagement

304
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,291
to be over so I can head home,
where I've got wood,

305
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,041
hot and burning on the fire,
ready to heat me up,

306
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,750
and my girl waiting
for me with pleasure

307
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,458
spread across her face.

308
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,458
Heads up!

309
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,541
The time's come
to pound this out!

310
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,666
Some of you guys
couldn't hold on.

311
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,666
Pathetic!

312
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,083
Those squirts have
been discharged.

313
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,125
Prematurely!

314
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,500
But you came through.

315
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,958
You came quick, hard!

316
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:50,916
In! And out!

317
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,541
Over and over! Strong!

318
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,666
But we're not finished yet!

319
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,583
Now, we must thrust forward!

320
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,833
Stay on top of each other.

321
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,083
Give a hand when needed.

322
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,125
And let's bring this
thing to a climax!

323
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,291
Hey.

324
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,958
How's your journal
entry diddling going?

325
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,958
It's wet.

326
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,541
I get it.
Rub out a few thoughts

327
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,833
before walking hard
and fast into death.

328
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,125
This is stimulating, ya know?

329
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,583
Going so deep into an
operation like this.

330
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,791
Know what I heard?

331
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,250
No one's ever pulled
out successfully before.

332
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,750
'S true.

333
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,541
Ask that old bastard; he's
been around the block before.

334
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,791
Apparently he rode out
the 4th Bartholin Campaign

335
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,333
and hasn't been the same since.

336
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,500
Well, Gramps?

337
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,083
You think we'll be
able to squeeze one off?

338
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,625
Need lube.

339
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,750
Come again?

340
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,541
Vas deferens,
that's how you know.

341
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,750
What? Your oral skills
blow, old man!

342
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,041
Give him a minute.

343
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,416
He starts off slow, that's all.

344
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,375
Beware the name General Scottie!

345
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,791
We can't let him win!

346
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,625
He must go down!

347
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,541
It's time, seamen!

348
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,833
Get off!

349
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:58,916
Stay strong!

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,875
Incoming!!

351
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,250
Get on top of that mound!

352
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,750
Fire your load at will!

353
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,458
Let's cream 'em, boys!

354
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,291
Go! Go! Go!

355
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,583
That's huge!

356
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,708
This will never work!

357
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,125
Pull out!

358
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,583
Withdraw now!

359
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,166
Almost there!

360
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,166
Fuck this! Fuck this!

361
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,458
Oh my God!

362
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,791
Damn those things!

363
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,541
They wiped us out!

364
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,083
We were so close!

365
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,375
We could have gone all the way!

366
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,916
Oh, shit!

367
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,916
Why?

368
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,125
What part of
"I have a hangover

369
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,291
every fucking morning"
don't you get?

370
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,291
Gone! Gone!

371
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,125
What's gone?

372
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:07,916
Your period?

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,291
Because that's weird.

374
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,291
Just leave me alone!

375
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm in physical pain here!

376
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,041
Where are all the tissues?

377
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:16,916
Dude!

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
Do you have a fucking cold?

379
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,375
Stop! You're freaking me out!

380
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,875
Now you're just torturing me!

381
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,375
Look, if you can't
find a tissue,

382
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,166
just use your tongue;
that's what I always do.

383
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,208
I hate you!

384
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,625
Don't pretend you know what
I'm going through right now!

385
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,875
I'm not that great
with aim, okay.

386
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,833
And even if I was, I couldn't
shoot myself in the mouth.

387
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,041
Plus, my alter boys need
softness and sensitivity.

388
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,166
A tissue is the answer.

389
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,750
It is the only way!

390
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,875
Only way for what?

391
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,666
You know!

392
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,500
I am so over this convo.

393
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,875
C'mon Stockin' let's go.

394
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,708
I guess we should get
off to school and shit.

395
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,041
Right! Get off!

396
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,625
No one's getting anywhere!

397
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,166
We've got a problem, angels!

398
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,083
This phenomenon is no
longer limited to Daten City.

399
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,791
It's already grown into a
nationwide social dilemma!

400
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,000
There are riots spurting
up all over the place!

401
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,708
Children are in tears
because they can't master

402
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,375
baiting techniques in art class!

403
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,708
Police are beating
off protestors

404
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,875
with their bare hands!

405
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,250
Politicians not coming on time,

406
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:25,666
well that goes
without saying, but--

407
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,916
In short.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,208
To be without a tissue
is to be without God!

409
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,458
I am a man of faith,
and just look at me!

410
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,958
I'm practically dying over here!

411
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,875
The men of the world cannot
take no more pressure!

412
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,500
Don't you worry, men, no shame
if you cry. Hell, I'm gonna cry!

413
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,708
You gonna cry?

414
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,875
Yo, babe we all gonna cry!

415
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:46,833
I'm gonna blow!

416
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:51,250
Maximum Climax!

417
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,250
That was fucking amazing!

418
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,708
No, that was fucking
awkward as hell.

419
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,041
Awkward as fuck.

420
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,916
You girls should be a
little more understanding.

421
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,375
A clue! Someone must
have inserted it

422
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,583
while I was busy,
you know, doing that!

423
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,750
You hear that, ladies?

424
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,833
Panty and Stocking are needed!

425
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,750
Holy fuck has
his head gone limp.

426
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes! Cream pie flavor!

427
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,333
Bingo!

428
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,416
I would definitely call that
the nether regions of the city.

429
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,500
And what a spunky
little hole it is.

430
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,541
A stank-ass hole.

431
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,583
Smells fishy.

432
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,666
Fuck-- are you
sure that's not you?

433
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,166
It must be that clam
chowder I had earlier.

434
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,291
Get inside now!

435
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,750
Ain't no time for
pussyfooting around!

436
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,666
Penetrate and conquer!

437
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,750
Let your cocked -- girls.

438
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,791
Leave no hole --.

439
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,791
Give them a holy -- injection!

440
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,333
The whole world
is counting on you!

441
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,541
We can't understand what
you're fucking saying!

442
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,500
Damn it.

443
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,958
A cunning linguist he is not.

444
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,541
Thanks for nothing, bro.

445
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,458
Fuck me!

446
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,666
Well hello lovah!

447
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,166
Only you would fall
for a literal stiff.

448
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,375
What's that smell?

449
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,291
Oh.

450
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,875
I'm getting a whiff of coinage.

451
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,666
Jesus, talk about some
fucking tight ass quarters.

452
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,791
I don't know.

453
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,208
If it's big enough
to get the job done,

454
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,541
it's big enough for me.

455
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,791
White alert!

456
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,916
No blockers allowed!

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,583
Go away!

458
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,500
They're so cute;
I just wanna swallow 'em up!

459
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,291
So you're the tools
behind this mess.

460
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,250
You guys squirted junk
all over this place.

461
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,958
I wanna touch one so bad!

462
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,041
This factory shouldn't
have been erected!

463
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,958
It screwed up everything!

464
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,708
That murderous General
Scottie can go to hell!

465
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,958
To hell!

466
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,458
The tissues they make
have spilled our blood

467
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,875
time and again.

468
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,416
The tissues they make
are the reason

469
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,583
we turned into ghosts!

470
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,583
So we're gonna destroy it!

471
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,333
We're gonna destroy it!

472
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,125
So what, are you gonna
gang up on my mouth next?

473
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,166
That depends.

474
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,708
Are you an ally
of General Scottie?

475
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,000
Newsflash, tiny dancer,

476
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,708
I don't know who the
fuck you're talking about.

477
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,333
Here.

478
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,208
I'll tell ya what.

479
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't care about Scottie.

480
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,500
But I do care about
making you guys suffer.

481
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,166
You stupid jerk-off prick!

482
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,041
Nail her!

483
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,125
Go back to your damn balls,
ya fuckin' low counts.

484
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:29,833
Panty.

485
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:30,708
Come on!

486
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:31,666
I just want one.

487
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,583
They're so
afreakingdorable!

488
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,291
Fuck that. They're cute
enough when you're just

489
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,333
lookin' at 'em,
I'll give it to ya.

490
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,250
But get some in your eye,
it's gonna burn.

491
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,708
Them bitter motherfuckers!

492
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,583
O, pitiful shadows
lost in the darkness.

493
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,250
O, evil spirits
born of those

494
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,250
drifting between
Heaven and Earth.

495
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,583
Guess what's next.

496
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,833
Everyone!

497
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,875
Prepare to surge forward
with the seeds of anger!

498
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,333
Yeah!

499
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,416
Surge forth!
Surge forth! Surge forth!

500
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,416
Surge forth! Surge forth!
Surge forth! Surge forth!

501
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,791
Surge forth!
Surge forth! Surge forth!

502
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,666
Surge forth! Surge forth!
Surge forth! Surge forth!

503
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,958
Surge forth!
Surge forth! Surge forth!

504
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,333
Yada yada with great vengeance.

505
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,625
And furious anger!

506
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,708
Now, brothers!

507
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,833
Let the final ejaculation flow!

508
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,916
Time to repent motherfuckers!

509
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,958
Porschach's journal.

510
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,416
August 16th.

511
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,541
Early morning.

512
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,000
0600 hours.

513
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,500
Fair weather, but with
higher than average waves.

514
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,625
My spirit count is high.

515
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,125
These are the annals of war.

516
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,625
I'm desperate for this
bitter engagement to be over

517
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,666
so I can head home,
where I've got wood,

518
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,083
hot and burning on the fire,
ready to heat me up.

519
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,083
And my girl waiting for me with
pleasure spread across her face.

520
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,666
Squirts!

521
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,916
The time's come to
pound this operation out!

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,625
After a rough battle, General
Scottie finally succumbed

523
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,666
as he felt the strength
of our brother's lengthy

524
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,458
and gut wrenching invasion!

525
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,958
We're now riding on new ground.

526
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,541
We've officially
penetrated enemy territory!

527
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,416
Yes, men!

528
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,625
You have proven yourself

529
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,041
to be hard, and strong,
with great stamina!

530
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,208
This is my final order.

531
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,083
Thrust ahead with no fear!

532
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,666
Give her everything you've got!

533
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,208
This is the climax!

534
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,125
Saturate the area!

535
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,750
Almost there!

536
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,208
These are my men.

537
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:48,083
Without them, I never
would have made it this far!

538
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,583
Finally!

539
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,125
This bush is ours.

540
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,541
I've never felt more alive!

541
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,083
We won!

542
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,791
We're coming in!
