1
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,625
"Once upon a
time in Garterbelt!"

2
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,916
Ew, who would want
to be in Garterbelt?

3
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,125
Lies.

4
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,083
They hide, while also acting
as keys to the doors of truth.

5
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,875
But what about the
doors that don't open?

6
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,541
Can a key of lies open them,

7
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,375
or has the key been
a lie the whole time?

8
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,708
Did you hear that?

9
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,625
Yeah, that was the sound
of your mind being blown.

10
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,250
Are you fucking me right now?

11
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,000
You lying sacks of angel shit!

12
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,666
You're supposed to
be emissaries of God,

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,541
not selfish chicken-headed hoes!

14
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,208
Motherfucker needs to
motherfuckin' chillax

15
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,916
before he has a
motherfuckin' stroke.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,416
Which would rock

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,083
because then he could only
use half his face to yell at us.

18
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,625
Shut the fuck up!

19
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,833
You need to worry about your
shitty ass situation, not me!

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,416
Focus, bitches!

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,833
While you've been cock
jumping and embracing

22
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,791
your inevitable diabetic coma,
shit's been going down

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,125
with the ghosts in this town!

24
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,500
People's freaking the fuck out!

25
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,000
Now does hell on Earth mean
anything to you hookers?

26
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,083
You need to stop acting like
a couple of Babylonian whores

27
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,791
and remember why the fuck
you're here to begin with!

28
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,583
Um, ball gag alert.

29
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,625
Yeah, that's just a holy
device used during prayer.

30
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,875
Oh really?

31
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,166
Because it kinda looks
like a fuckin' ball gag.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,708
Cheese it, Panty!

33
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,791
This could be our chance to
get Afrodiculous off our backs!

34
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:13,958
Okay, but how?

35
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,791
Let's watch him!

36
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,750
Homo she didn't!

37
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,333
That douchebag
has a hidden room!

38
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,541
You know that's gotta be where
he does all of his pervy shit.

39
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,000
That dude is messed up as hell!

40
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,500
If we catch him in
the pervy shit act,

41
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,541
we could blackmail
him into leaving us

42
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,208
the fuck alone for once.

43
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,875
Come on, Stockin',
let's go get his ass!

44
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,000
Fucking hell, these
stairs go on forever!

45
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,416
This is bullshit!

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,125
It's filthy, dark, and moist;
like you on a full moon.

47
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,000
Shut up!

48
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:03,958
You know I hate the word moist!

49
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:04,958
Ow! Goddamnit, Panty!

50
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:05,916
You stepped on my foot!

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Dude!

52
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,250
It's as dark as
Garter's soul in here.

53
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Someone turn on
a fucking light.

54
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,500
Sweaty testes, Stockin'!
What was that for?

55
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,791
You asked for light.

56
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,208
Holy shit titties.

57
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,208
Where are we?

58
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,416
Steps!

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,250
Shit!

60
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,958
Fuck! Goddamn motherfuckery!

61
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,416
Fuck! That dick muncher
doesn't give us credit.

62
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,666
I mean, Jesus, Garter, make
it a fuckin' challenge, otay?!

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
I think we might
have a challenge.

64
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,458
Wha~?

65
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,500
Ow!

66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,250
In your face, ass-wagon!

67
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,000
So, whaddaya think?

68
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,375
Looks like a dead end.

69
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,625
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,791
Where's the fuckin' Afro?

71
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,625
Probably hiding somewhere.

72
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,291
Lame ass twat.

73
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,083
Shit, man; I don't think
we're gonna find anything.

74
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,916
Panty! Check it out!

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,541
Check what out?

76
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,500
I think it's a book.

77
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,625
Please tell me it's
a gay porn bible!

78
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,000
You know, yeah, it might be.

79
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,500
This thing is
Garter's flipping diary.

80
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,916
Get the fuck out!

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
What if he decided to
journal a bunch of dirty shit

82
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,541
he doesn't want us to know,
and it's all in here?

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,375
Fuckin A!

84
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,541
Girl you know he did.

85
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
We got Garter by
the balls, now!

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,916
Oooh, read it in
your Garter voice!

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,625
Okay!

88
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,791
Ahem.

89
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,666
My story begins
like every story.

90
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,125
A long time ago,

91
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,500
I grew up in a shit hole,
so my choices were limited.

92
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,583
What's your name?

93
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,458
What the hell you care?

94
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,750
Are you an activist?

95
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,375
Nah, I'm a fuckin' maggot,
just like you pigs.

96
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,083
What?!

97
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,583
Garter was a bad ass?

98
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,583
How come he's a
walking vagina now?

99
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,791
Right?

100
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,291
Keep reading, I wanna
see what turned him.

101
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,791
If it was illegal, I did it.

102
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,083
Extortion, trafficking,
assault, smuggling,

103
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,916
public intox, public detox.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
Murderin' shit.

105
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,291
Pimpin' shit.

106
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,250
Drug dealing, in
particular, was my forte.

107
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,166
You gotta make the money first.

108
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,250
Then, when you get the
money, you get the power.

109
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,541
What the fuck are
you doin', Garter?

110
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,208
Without me, you wouldn't
have a goddamn penny

111
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,750
to your goddamn
worthless name, ya punk!

112
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,333
No one's gonna tie me down.

113
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,541
No one.

114
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,541
I clawed my way to
the top, until I was king.

115
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,333
King of the shit hole.

116
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,250
I had money, women,
power, you name it.

117
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,750
I had everything I ever wanted.

118
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,458
And then, I lost it all.

119
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,916
Hold on. That asshole died?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,791
Yeah.

121
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,125
This plot is super ridiculous.

122
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,000
So, if he's dead,
how can he be here?

123
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,541
That is a very good question.

124
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,291
Where am I?

125
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,708
Goddamn.

126
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,208
Yeah, right, I thought.

127
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,375
Yeah, right; I should be in
hell, and I damn well know it.

128
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,666
So what, I'm supposed to be
a missionary for the Lord?

129
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,708
Fuck that.

130
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,625
I don't' take
orders from no one.

131
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me tell you
something, "God"

132
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,458
or whatever your name is,
I don't give a fuck who you are,

133
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,791
I do what I want!

134
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,666
And if you don't like it,

135
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
you can suck my giant cock

136
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,875
and write all about it in
your goddamn holy book!

137
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,958
Oh, now I am pissed.

138
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,333
If only I had been sent to hell.

139
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,833
The punishment I faced
instead was far crueler

140
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,375
than I could have
ever imagined.

141
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,083
I have witnessed
many things since then.

142
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,166
Creation, destruction,
life, death, prosperity,

143
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
the opposite of prosperity.

144
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,708
And still, my curse continued
to restrain and torment me.

145
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,000
Eventually, though,
I had a revelation.

146
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,208
It is within the awesome
bondage of suffering

147
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,250
that true joy exists.

148
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,458
This concludes Part One of,

149
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,375
"My Mission as Garter"
by Garterbelt.

150
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,500
Thank you for reading.

151
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,125
Please use the exit
on the west side.

152
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,833
Part Two will be available
early next year

153
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,125
or the following
year; it depends.

154
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
Well, shit. I think
we fell asleep.

155
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,333
Do you remember at all
what we were doing here?

156
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,125
Let's see.

157
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,875
Yeah, no, fuck if I have a clue.

158
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,208
What's this say?

159
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,375
Well, whatever, I'm
getting out of this hell hole.

160
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,833
Me, too.

161
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,166
I'm gonna find some sugar.

162
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,416
Then I'm going to bed.

163
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,916
Same for me, but with
cock instead of sugar.

164
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,416
Shit, I thought them
bitches would never leave.

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,375
Can't have no one
interrupting my contrition.

166
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,375
Bondage is a sacred,
purifying ritual

167
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,708
between a penitent
man and his maker.

168
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,375
It clears the mind and shit.

169
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,125
The last thing I need is
to catch hell for it

170
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,375
from a couple of hoes.

171
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,333
You're late again, Chuck.

172
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,458
Come on.

173
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,500
Let's get this party
started, already.

174
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,250
"Nothing to Room!"

175
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,166
I like this music.

176
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,666
It's fun.

177
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,250
Speaking of getting laid,
how'd things go last night?

178
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,333
That guy?

179
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,708
Please tell me something
got penetrated.

180
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,041
Nah, we just made out;

181
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,666
didn't want him to
think I was slutty.

182
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
I almost let him go
down on me, though.

183
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,333
Are you fucking kidding?

184
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,875
You're like the definition
of lame, sister!

185
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,833
If lame means
"not a big ass whore."

186
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,500
Why you gotta be all up
on my nut sac, anyway?

187
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,541
Oh, don't get all pissy;

188
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,875
I was just wondering.

189
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,208
Your sex life is depressing.

190
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,250
I regret not letting
him at least finger me

191
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,416
if that will help
you sleep at night.

192
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,291
It will.

193
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,750
This is taking
for fucking ever.

194
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,583
What time is it?

195
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,416
You got a watch, right?

196
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,583
What the shit hell?

197
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,416
We've been waiting
for five goddamn hours?

198
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,833
I bet that fuckin'
afro taint licker

199
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,458
is trying to starve
us to death!

200
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,833
Dude! Garter!

201
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
Why don't you hurry the
fuck up for Christ's sake!?!

202
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,166
If we die out here,
we're gonna kill you!

203
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,833
Patience is a virtue!

204
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,333
Shut the fuck up, bitches!

205
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,250
God, this is such bullshit.

206
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,708
I guess we're just
supposed to sit here

207
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,500
and wait around until dinner
for that slow ass dickwad

208
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,041
to get around to
making us lunch.

209
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,875
He spent all of yesterday
in the kitchen too.

210
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,166
And what did he have installed
while we were at the club?

211
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,541
A fucking, door!

212
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,666
It's so not feng shui.

213
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,791
Oh, yeah, I know;

214
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,208
after that he put
a shitty little note

215
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,250
on the outside of it that
said, "no angels allowed."

216
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,791
Sounds like he finally lost it.

217
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,000
Whatever!
He never had it to start with!

218
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,416
Is it ready?

219
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,000
Motherfucker!

220
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,583
I'm starving my
ass off over here!

221
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,458
Gimmie some of those!

222
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,666
I don't have to give you shit.

223
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,166
Here, just don't grab
a whole crapload

224
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,291
and break 'em all like usual.

225
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,916
So. You don't want
me to do this!

226
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,583
They should warn you about this
fucking possibility on the box.

227
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,416
So sue 'em, but first get
your digits outta my food.

228
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Okay, you hold on to
it while I pull! Go!

229
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,125
Yes.

230
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,833
Almost there.

231
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,958
Close, oh!

232
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,666
Oh my God!

233
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,583
It's half-off day at
Daten City Bakery!

234
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,000
That's right, come on in...

235
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,541
Yeah, I just saw your commercial

236
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,458
and wanted to place a delivery
order for two bakers' dozen

237
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,708
each of petit fours,
cheese pockets, cream puffs,

238
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,583
cherry crowns, and
cinnamon crispies.

239
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,666
Oh, and can I get a
chocolate ice box pie

240
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,875
to go with that, as well?

241
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,083
They're half-off today, right?

242
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,291
Jeez. Is that all lady?

243
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,625
I see your point; better
make it three dozen.

244
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,583
Yep, bring it to the
church like normal.

245
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,458
God bless!

246
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,875
Dude, check it!

247
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,250
I've figured out how we
can get back into Heaven!

248
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,500
Here, this is the Earth.

249
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,541
And the rest of the room
is all of outer space.

250
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,166
Okay. I don't get it.

251
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,291
Focus.

252
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,541
So, let's say we got
this big ass pole,

253
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,875
like it's really
fuckin' long, right?

254
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,375
Then we stick that shit
onto the Earth like this.

255
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,375
See?

256
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,833
This is you.

257
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:32,916
Now, pay attention.

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
"Goddamnit, what is this pole?"

259
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,791
and you start walking up it like
anyone would do and are like,

260
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,625
"Where the shit does it go?"
so you just keep going

261
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,458
higher and higher
until guess what!

262
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,166
Come on, you're not guessing!

263
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,041
Gimmie something
to work with!

264
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,250
Anytime, Stockin'.

265
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,750
Don't be a bitch!

266
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,166
If you keep on climbing higher,
where the hell do you go?

267
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625
The top of the pole.

268
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,416
Jesus!

269
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,583
Up here is space, get it?

270
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,500
It's the universe!

271
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,791
The room is the
entire cosmos!

272
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,333
All we have to do is
stick a pole in the ground

273
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,208
and crawl up to space.

274
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,583
How awesome is that?

275
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,791
It seems so simple now that
I've said it out loud,

276
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,041
don't you think?

277
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,833
I think you're ignoring
things like physics and,

278
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,958
you know, oxygen, but yeah.

279
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,125
I see what you're saying.

280
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,416
Now, why would we
want to do that again?

281
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,666
Quit acting like an idiot;

282
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,541
you're supposed to
be the smart one!

283
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,958
Stockin'.

284
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,250
If we make a long enough pole,
eventually we'll be able

285
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,208
to crawl all the way
back up to Heaven!

286
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,250
Why the hell do you wanna
go back to Heaven so bad?

287
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,583
Can I put the
Earth down now?

288
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,208
So, what are you saying?

289
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,833
Do you not wanna go back?

290
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,750
Well, there's a lot of really
good processed sugar down here,

291
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,125
and that shit's cheap.

292
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,458
And plus, I mean, you
seem to think the guys here

293
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,583
are perfectly fuckable,
so, it's whatever.

294
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,291
To be honest, recently
the dudes I've come across

295
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,125
haven't made me
come much at all.

296
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,125
Take that cocksucker from
the club last night, right?

297
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,041
What a felchburger, man.

298
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,041
And he disguised
his douchebaggery

299
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,333
by being hot as fuck.

300
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,541
God, I hate that.

301
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,958
He was a finger pointer!

302
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,166
And he'd say shit like,
"Welcome to the gun show!"

303
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,375
And I was like, dude,

304
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,625
fuck off ya' leg humper,
I'm a goddamn lady.

305
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,000
But he was just like,

306
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,000
"I've got the biggest moose
knuckle in the world;'

307
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,750
don't you wanna
have sex with me?!

308
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,458
You sure he didn't have
a mental thing going on

309
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,125
because that is so your type.

310
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,416
Which is fine if they're nice,

311
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,625
but I don't like
Aspergers with extra ass.

312
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,083
God, Panty, you are so racist.

313
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh, and while we were doing it,

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,250
he told me that, get this,
I was better than his mom.

315
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,666
What kind of fucked
up shit is that?

316
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,416
So, after all that,
you still diddled him?

317
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,583
Well, yeah,
why would I not?

318
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,750
Goddamnit, I'm too hungry!

319
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,958
When I get like this,
it makes me depressed!

320
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,041
Shit.

321
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,208
Makes me cuss
like a fucking sailor.

322
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:22,875
Oh, man.

323
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,083
I'm turning emo.

324
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,250
I gotta eat before
I start the cutting.

325
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,416
You've been eating
this whole time!

326
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,125
Snacking just screws
with my blood sugar

327
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,333
and makes me hungrier.

328
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,708
You don't know me!

329
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,083
Oh, God, the emo's taking hold!

330
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,208
Gross, I'm about to
start writing poetry!

331
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,083
Whoa, why are you pissed at me?

332
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,750
Your blood sugar is fucked
because you've probably got

333
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,916
diabetes or some shit from
eating sugar all the damn time.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,333
So, maybe take responsibility

335
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,125
before you have to write a
poem about losing a foot.

336
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,666
The only way I'm losing
my foot is up your ass!

337
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,666
Now why don't you do that
whole responsibility thing

338
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,375
and mind your own
goddamn business?

339
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,916
Seriously, go dry
hump something!

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,708
I'm too hungry to
deal with your shit!

341
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,916
I never thought I'd say this,

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,833
but I'm too hungry
to dry hump anything!

343
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,958
I'd take a cooked weiner
over a real weiner right now.

344
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,583
Do you understand how
hard that is for me?!

345
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,166
I can't do this anymore.

346
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,208
Let's go get food.

347
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,208
No way.

348
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,500
I don't have the
energy to do shit.

349
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,500
See! That's the
diabetes talking!

350
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,208
Holy Mary Mother of Shit, what
the hell is taking so long?!

351
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,625
Answer me, semen demon!

352
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,458
Well, fuck you very much!

353
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,958
I don't wanna play anymore!

354
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,750
Hey, Stockin'.

355
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,125
Do you wanna order pizza?

356
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,250
I'm gonna order three hundred
puddings, how about you?

357
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,666
Anything a pot head would
eat sounds good to me!

358
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,125
Hello, I want to order
one of every pizza you got!

359
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,708
Hello, could I get the
jumbo sweet curry

360
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,833
with sticky rice, please?

361
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,208
Hello, I want everything
on your menu

362
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,875
that comes with fried
rice and noodles!

363
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,791
Girl, we ordered so
much food the last place

364
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
threw in a lapband for free.

365
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,833
Well, then after we eat,
we should hit up the club

366
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,500
and have ourselves a
little fuck fest.

367
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,291
Fuck that guy!

368
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,041
Fuck this guy!

369
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,375
Fuck those guys.

370
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,541
We'll find everything that
has a dick and fuck it!

371
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,791
Okay! I call dibs on the guys

372
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,958
with facial piercings
and mommy issues!

373
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:33,666
Sweet!

374
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,125
Fuck.

375
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,000
Me!

376
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,125
That's the spirit, Stockin'.

377
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:41,458
I'm totally fuckin' stoked now!

378
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,333
Yes!

379
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,750
About damn time;

380
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
Guess who made it here
first I'll give you a dollar!

381
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:50,125
I'm gonna go with Chinese;
those mo fo's can deliver!

382
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,375
Motherfucker!

383
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,625
We didn't order
uncircumcised Geek Boy.

384
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,791
Hey there, girls.

385
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,208
Don't tell me the
party's over already!

386
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,541
What party, ya fuck nut?

387
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,041
I'm not really sure;
Garter just told me

388
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,583
there was gonna be
a lunch party today.

389
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah, well Garter's
full of shit.

390
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,625
Party or not, aren't
you a little late?

391
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,375
And it's customary
to bring snacks.

392
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,458
I'm sorry!

393
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,791
I'm showing up a
lot late, you're right.

394
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,041
It's just that Garter
put me in charge of music

395
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,666
and I couldn't figure
out what CD to bring.

396
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,000
I went back and forth,

397
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,416
but I ended up going with
Factory's "Number Nine."

398
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,125
Have you heard of them?

399
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
Their bassist is sick.

400
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,958
That's Factory Divisions, right?

401
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,916
Oh, I think you meant
to say Factory Division.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,416
That's what I said, ya doucher!

403
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,833
No, you said Factory Divisions,

404
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,000
but it's just Factory
Division without the "s."

405
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,500
Also, Number Nine is actually
by Factory Order, little trivia.

406
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,958
Hey, so, Stockin',
remember that whole

407
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,458
"no Aspergers with
extra ass" situation

408
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,958
we were talking about earlier?

409
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,833
Yeah, no fucking
little bitch geeks either!

410
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,958
Agreed one hundred percent.

411
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,375
Um, I don't get it.

412
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,750
It's just a bit of small talk.

413
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,750
Nothing to worry
your head about

414
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,541
Oh, right.

415
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,916
That's cool, then.

416
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,458
I guess.

417
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,041
No way! I love the Real
Housewives of DC!

418
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,291
I mean, I hate how
they make people

419
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,166
from Daten City
look, but still.

420
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,000
Who's your fave?

421
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,333
I think Joel's the coolest!

422
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,541
I don't know who in the
hell you're talking about.

423
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,708
Oh.

424
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,791
Well.

425
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,583
He just seems like
a really cool guy.

426
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,583
Hey, there, Chuck.

427
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,541
Whatcha eating?

428
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,041
Looks, good!

429
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,916
Chuck, where the
fuck did you go?!

430
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,208
Fuck, yeah! I love this show!

431
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,625
What's happened so far?

432
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,625
Sal the Schlong finally
broke up with Sally the Slut.

433
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,583
Seriously?

434
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,541
That guy's a dickhead!

435
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,833
I don't think that's very fair.

436
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,041
She was sleeping
with two other guys

437
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,958
while supposedly
planning their wedding.

438
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,166
Yeah, I guess that is
kind of a bitch ass move.

439
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,375
So she's just supposed
to turn down hot sex?

440
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,916
She was in a committed
relationship, of course she is!

441
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Right, Stocking?

442
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,375
Why are you here again?

443
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,500
Wasn't it for a lunch party
or something like that?

444
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,125
Yes, Garter sent me an email
yesterday inviting me over here

445
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,083
to celebrate, but it
didn't have any details.

446
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:50,708
Who cares.

447
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,291
What about Sally?!

448
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,958
You know, the other day while
Garter was bitching about you,

449
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
he did mention that he thought
he should do something special

450
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,666
to thank you for all the hard
work you've been doing lately.

451
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,416
What? The guy with
the afro did?

452
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,291
Nope, gotta be up
to something shitty.

453
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,666
Wait!

454
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,916
What if the party is his way
to congratulate you guys

455
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,750
on earning enough money
to go back to Heaven?

456
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,875
Hey! I'm from Damned Pizza!

457
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,958
Hi! I'm from Chicken Chicks.

458
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,500
Hi! I'm from Beach Puff!

459
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,375
Hello, peoples!

460
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,875
I'm from Sushi Royale!

461
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,958
Mandarin Chinese here!

462
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,833
I can't believe you
did that to Garter.

463
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,333
Look.

464
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,500
How about you don't judge us
since your ass just got here

465
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,958
and we've been starving forever!

466
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,458
We waited eight and a half
hours so you can't say shit!

467
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,500
You know what eight
and a half hours

468
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,833
of no food does to a girl?!?

469
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,208
So what? Big deal.

470
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,208
Garter's been working on
this lunch since yesterday,

471
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,541
and that's a whole lot longer
than eight and a half hours.

472
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,875
He's doing all of this for you,

473
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,875
but it's like you guys
don't even care about it.

474
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,125
Fine, we're waiting;

475
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,791
now will you please shut
your fucking piehole.

476
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,416
Shit!

477
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,250
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

478
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,041
I see you bitches started
the party without me.

479
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,208
No, we waited. It's just
that you were taking all day.

480
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,875
And, you never told
us there was a party,

481
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,833
so we didn't,
you know, know that.

482
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,125
Oh, snap.

483
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,250
Yeah, I didn't even
tell you what it was for.

484
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,458
My angels, the truth is it...

485
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,166
No, that's cool!

486
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,416
We totally know!

487
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,291
Now, let's eat some grub
and get wasted as hell!

488
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,041
No; let me announce this!

489
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
It's important.

490
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,291
Y'see, I, Garterbelt, have
the pleasure to announce

491
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,375
that The Association of
Afro Brothers has chosen

492
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,208
my afro as
"The World's Most BeautiFro."

493
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,625
Can you believe it?

494
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,958
Affie finally gets the
acknowledgement he deserves!

495
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:24,541
What?

496
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,750
That's so cool!

497
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,166
I didn't know there was
an Afro Brotherhood!

498
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,666
It's an elite organization.

499
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,416
I know you're surprised.
I don't blame you.

500
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,416
Imagine how I feel!

501
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,125
Now, eat up and
enjoy the party.

502
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,291
Myself, I'm mofackin' exhausted.

503
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,583
I'm off to bed!

504
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,333
Goodnight, everyone!

505
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,041
One more thing.

506
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,791
Waste not want not,
you fucking whores!

507
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,375
All food is a gift from God,
and it is not to be shat upon!

508
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,583
No crumb shall be
left uneaten. Understood?

509
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,416
You two are a couple of real
assholes, you know that?

510
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,916
You know what, now
that I think about it,

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,333
Factory Division is
a bunch of guys

512
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,791
from different
parts of the UK,

513
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,708
and technically the country
is divided into sections,

514
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,833
so maybe it really is
Divisions with an s

515
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,291
instead of just one division.

516
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,916
What if I've been
wrong this whole time?

517
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,333
Hi! I'm with Puff Puff Pass,

518
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,250
and I have a Pot Head
Snack Attack for Miss Panty?

519
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,333
I'm with Daten City
Bakery, and I have, um...

520
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,500
Well, I have pretty much

521
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,916
the whole bakery for
a Mistress Stocking.

522
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,166
I have to go Google the answer.

523
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,041
Sorry guys.

524
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,083
Check you later!

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,166
I am so bloated right now,
if I see even a single grain

526
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,500
of fuckin' fried rice,
I think I'm gonna die.

527
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,375
Oh, please stop
talking about food!

528
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,500
This is miserable.

529
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,750
Why am I not bulimic?

530
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,875
Oh, sweet vomit, where
are you when I need you?

531
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,416
I have a question.

532
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,333
The whole not going back to
Heaven thing, were you serious?

533
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,375
I dunno.

534
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,000
I never said
I was serious, did I?

535
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,791
How many fuckin' coins
do we have to get?

536
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,458
Dunno that either, but I guess
we'll get there eventually.

537
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,500
Hey, if it's gonna take too
long, do you maybe wanna do

538
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,958
that crawling up the
pole thing with me?

539
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,291
Totally, and, you know,

540
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,583
I figure if we make the
pole flat and wide enough,

541
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,250
we can just drive
See Through all the way up.

542
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,916
That seems so obvious now;

543
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,625
you're like a fuckin
genius or something.

544
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,416
Yeah, well, it's all
thanks to the sugar.

545
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,416
So, what about the club,
you still wanna go?

546
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,791
I don't think so; we won't
be able to fit in VIP.

547
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,166
Ew, yeah; fuck that shit.

548
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,583
Hey, not to get all up
on your nutsac again,

549
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,000
but are you gonna
let whats-his-face

550
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,916
penetrate you anytime soon?
