1
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,750
"DC Confidential!"

2
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,666
Daten City.

3
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,958
A burrow beloved by demons.

4
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,250
An enduring chaos
thrives in this place,

5
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,875
yet is sealed away from
the rest of the world.

6
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,250
However, that 'good book'

7
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,291
so many humans
rely on says it best,

8
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,583
"for there is nothing covered,
that shall not be revealed;

9
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,250
and hid, that shall
not be known."

10
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:34,041
The problem is finding the key
to unlock that detestable seal!

11
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,708
The bloodline of the Hell's
Monkey is the only solution.

12
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,250
A descendent must be
located immediately.

13
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,583
Excuse me.

14
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,250
Sir, is everything all right?

15
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,333
My apologies.

16
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,916
Continue with your report.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,250
Yes, Sir.

18
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,958
We would like, at this
juncture, to move forward

19
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,583
onto the second portion of
our annual Ghost Report.

20
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,666
Ghost number 36, also
known as Big Brown Eye.

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,416
This was a metaphysical
manifestation of grudges

22
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,083
held by plumbers who,
crushed by copious amounts

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,666
of fecal matter clogging
drains throughout the city,

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,250
suffocated to death
as the waste

25
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,083
tragically obstructed
their intake of oxygen.

26
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,083
This manifestation
then proceeded

27
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,750
to disgustingly possess
all the feces in the city.

28
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,458
Its hideous essence
left witnesses

29
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,791
and all would be attackers

30
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,458
helpless to do anything
but vomit uncontrollably,

31
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,625
making it a rather
impressively potent ghost.

32
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,500
However, the theme I
am sure you have,

33
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,416
at this point,
perceived, pervades.

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,250
Those unabashedly crude,
hopelessly delusional,

35
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,791
horrifyingly idiotic ne'er
do well angel trollops blasted

36
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,500
our Big Brown Eye to bits.

37
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,625
Of course they did.

38
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,833
Don't tell me you honestly

39
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,375
put significant faith
in fecal matter.

40
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,291
Oh.

41
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,375
Sir, no, of course not.

42
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,375
How comforting.

43
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,041
Continue.

44
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,833
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,958
Ghost number 37, also known as
The Fast and Not So Furious.

46
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,458
This specter was the
manifestation of a grudge held

47
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,083
by a speedy and overly
ticketed taxi driver,

48
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,375
who accidentally
drove off a cliff.

49
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,000
In the end, he
was blasted to bits

50
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,125
after what could be referred
to as failing to yield.

51
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,416
He was the very definition
of idiocy in action.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
What a mockery.

53
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,958
Continue.

54
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,041
Ghost Number 38.

55
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,958
Also known as Queen Bee.

56
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,666
She was the manifestation of a
female student's lust for power.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,833
Once reigning over the school
as its most popular attendee,

58
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,958
or queen, she was attacked
and killed by pet bees

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,791
belonging to a nerd on
whom she frequently picked.

60
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,375
Her plot to reclaim
her crown was thwarted

61
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,750
by those horrendous angels
and a geek named Brief.

62
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,875
She also was blasted into bits.

63
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,041
As though being the most
popular girl in high school

64
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,375
is the pinnacle of power.

65
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,625
Doomed from the start
by flawed assumption.

66
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,125
She was a waste of a ghost
if ever I've seen one.

67
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,375
Right.

68
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,583
So.

69
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,458
Ghost number 39, or
Little Red Riding Hood

70
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,000
and The Big Bad Wolf, are
the manifestation of grudges,

71
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,041
held by a prostitute
and her pimp.

72
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,208
Apparently they were eaten

73
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,916
by a wolf while soliciting
sex in a park.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

75
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,625
Now that is something to behold.

76
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,333
Tighter, tighter.

77
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,833
Kneesocks?

78
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,083
Is it just me, or is there
something wrong with the mayor?

79
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,208
I don't know.

80
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,083
Perhaps he's acting
in such a fashion

81
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,208
because he's discovered a way

82
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,375
to dispose of those
revolting angels.

83
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,958
Yes, perhaps!

84
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,625
Enough chatter!

85
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,791
Shall we continue?

86
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:23,791
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,208
Ghost number 40,
who is, well are,

88
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,916
actually a group
of demon semen.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,250
Not of the sea but of the sperm.

90
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,875
They felt mistreated, so
they manifested themselves

91
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,875
into nasty little creatures
and raided the tissue plant

92
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,958
in an attempt to avenge
their pointless deaths.

93
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,958
Sadly, they were overcome and
blasted into tiny, tiny bits.

94
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,458
Sperm can't be trusted.

95
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,125
There are strong swimmers
and weak swimmers.

96
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,500
So true, sir.

97
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,083
Moving on.

98
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,666
Ghost number 41, The Diet Ghost.

99
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,916
She was the amalgamation of
the bitterness found in women

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,916
who put their faith
in fad diets,

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,916
only to end up
atrociously obese.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,041
One of our more
impressive attackers,

103
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,375
she opened a cake shop serving
specialized fat enhancing treats

104
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,750
and even managed to turn
one of those floozy angels

105
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,666
into a gargantuan abomination!

106
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,458
But alas, she was
blasted like all the rest.

107
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,458
Corn nuts!

108
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,750
Master?

109
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,458
At this time, do you
have any comments for us?

110
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,125
No. Just continue.

111
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,916
The mayor is not in
the best mood, Sister.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,333
Let's just get
through this, shall we?

113
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,458
Yes, that is my
current objective!

114
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,500
Next, of course, is Ghost number
42, the Fabulous Lingerie Ghost.

115
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,541
He was born from the grudge of
a teenage lingerie fanatic who,

116
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,750
after some of his more popular
peers stole his underwear

117
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,250
during the school's first
"unmentionables run,"

118
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,500
died when lightning mysteriously
struck his bare penis.

119
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,625
Quite by accident, he managed
to put those loathsome angels

120
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,208
in a precarious position,

121
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,000
but, yet again, that
"Brief" boy assisted them,

122
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,791
and the tackier of the two
angels blasted him to pieces.

123
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,708
So, next we have Ghost
number 43, Oscar the Snot.

124
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,541
This disgusting--

125
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,791
This is pathetic.

126
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,458
How many inconsequential
mediocre ghosts

127
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,583
can we have in one year?

128
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,833
At what point did our ghosts,
ghosts belonging to demons,

129
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,416
sink into a pit of inadequacy?

130
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,833
When I was young,

131
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
they still kept the spirit
of primordial chaos alive!

132
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,083
They were tough,
creative, strong,

133
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,750
and silent creatures of power!

134
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,208
But, now, apparently
those days are over!

135
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,791
Just look at this disaster
laid out before me!

136
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:24,500
These ghosts don't even
understand the meaning of chaos!

137
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,416
It makes me long
for my younger days.

138
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,291
If I had a heart,
it would be sad.

139
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,291
Let us end this
nonsense already.

140
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,208
By which you mean?

141
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,541
By which I mean.

142
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,625
You don't plan to
continue wasting my time

143
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,083
with these useless
reports of yours, do you?

144
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
Because I have better
things to do with my time

145
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,000
than sit here and listen
to your repetitive failures!

146
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:43,750
No, sir.

147
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,500
Of course not.

148
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,458
Putting up with his
mood swings is worse

149
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,541
than dealing with
those angel bitches.

150
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,125
Sister!

151
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:58,916
Your language!

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,708
Please!

153
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh, I'm so sorry.

154
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,958
You're quite right.

155
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,541
All this reporting and anxiety
has loosened my tongue.

156
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,208
You know, like after fellatio.

157
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,583
Far too loose, dear.

158
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,916
Fastener, darling, would you
bring us a sofa?

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,166
Oh and some wine, too.

160
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,625
While you're at it,
a little caviar,

161
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,208
blue cheese and crackers
wouldn't hurt.

162
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,750
Kneesocks, finally!

163
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,500
It's us!

164
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,583
Devil, we're gorgeous.

165
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,125
Look at you, Sister!

166
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,750
You're so shiny!

167
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,708
Oh, you are always
so sweet to me.

168
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,041
But, if anything, your beauty
radiates as intensely

169
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,666
as the dark sun of Hell.

170
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,250
Gross. It's that nerd, again.

171
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,375
He's like a little puppy,

172
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,458
traipsing after them
wherever they go.

173
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,833
You know what they say, fools
only attract other fools.

174
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,958
What is it about them?

175
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,875
Well, their vocabularies
are spectacular.

176
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,666
Oh, dear.

177
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
If I laugh too much, my
cheeks will start to hurt.

178
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,666
Would you like for me to rub
them for you, my darling?

179
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,916
No, stop that.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,958
My face will be as red
as yours, you drunkard!

181
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,333
I was born this way.

182
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,125
And if anything, I'd say
yours is a brighter crimson.

183
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,208
Do you think so?

184
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,583
I am rather flushed.

185
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,958
And you're burning up.

186
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,833
Here, allow me to
take your clothes off.

187
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,416
Oh! No... No...

188
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,666
You don't like that?

189
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,041
Are you sure?
I thought it was your favorite.

190
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,625
I prefer caviar.

191
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:21,333
"Stay true to your curiosity."
That is our Rule!

192
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,708
Oh my!

193
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,375
That's an interesting
place for it.

194
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,125
I've also got an oozing ripe fig

195
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,708
from the Diablo Orchard
for you, sister dearest!

196
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,958
Oh, yes.

197
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,000
That's not all that's
oozing and ripe, is it?

198
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,083
I just remembered!

199
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,625
I have something for you, too.

200
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
Do you remember that creamy milk

201
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,041
from the black goat
at Satan Fest?

202
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,791
Do I!

203
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,250
Rub it into every fold!

204
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,208
Every single one!

205
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,083
Shut up!

206
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,250
Well, look how free
and uninhibited you are.

207
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,541
I would be proud if I thought
you had earned such privileges!

208
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,791
You misunderstand, sir.

209
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,208
This is simply an
evaluation of our skills.

210
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,333
Exactly, as well as
an elaborate training

211
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,250
simulation relating
to future developments.

212
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,958
Oh! I forgot to ask you one
critically important question:

213
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,291
what has your research

214
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:11,250
into the Hell's Monkey
blood-descendent revealed?

215
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,291
The Hell's Monkey descendent?

216
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,541
Uhh, well.

217
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,791
We, um, are currently
investigating the matter

218
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,708
to our utmost ability.

219
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,250
Oh girls, it isn't nice to lie.

220
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,000
Give me a little
credit, will you?

221
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,625
Why don't you go reflect
upon your ineptitude?

222
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,750
Mister Mayor, no!

223
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,708
Anything but that!

224
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
Ghosts.

225
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,708
Demon Sisters.

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,125
All completely useless!

227
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,875
I still know nothing concerning
the Hell's Monkey descendent.

228
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,041
Oh god, find my happy place,
find my happy place...

229
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,208
It appears that in
the darkest despair,

230
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,375
there can be found
the darkest hope.

231
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,125
"Panty and Brief!"

232
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Repent, Motherfucker!

233
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,666
Mothershit.

234
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
It's practically raining
ghosts out here these days.

235
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,166
Well. Whatever,

236
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,166
that just means more Heaven
Coins for us, ya know.

237
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,458
Panty?

238
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,708
Thanks, yeah.

239
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,583
I'm good!

240
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,541
Fuck me!

241
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,916
Jesus!

242
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,041
Panty!

243
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,291
Goddamnit! Will
you quit screwing

244
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,500
everything in sight and,
I don't know, help me!

245
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,750
Why?

246
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,083
You seem to have it all
under control just fine.

247
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,125
I've got other shit
going on, anyway.

248
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,666
So. Believe it or not,

249
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,541
I've had a side project going on
ever since we got down here.

250
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,541
I can't wait.

251
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,041
This is so fucking huge, you're
not even going to believe it!

252
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,458
Okay, I'm totally gonna do
one thousand Earthly dudes

253
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,083
before I go back to Heaven!

254
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:08,958
Holy shit.

255
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,791
Your brain is rotting.

256
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,833
You really do have syphilis.

257
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,625
Great, another Godblessed
bullshit mandate.

258
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,750
What the fuck?

259
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,708
Panty!

260
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,500
Yeah, right there!

261
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,041
I don't care; just do it!

262
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,500
Selfish bitch!

263
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,125
For a good time, call me!

264
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,416
You don't even have
that many holes!

265
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,083
Congratulations, hooker angels!

266
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,708
You have finally collected
your Heavenly coin quota!

267
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,625
Now that your mission on
Earth is complete, you are free.

268
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,000
So, there you go.

269
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,041
I'm guessing that means you
can probably go back to Heaven.

270
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,958
Seriously?

271
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,208
The time has come
to get the fuck out.

272
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,916
Move your asses over here
and kneel before the alter.

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,333
So this is goodbye to
all my Earthly fuckin'.

274
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,750
Wow.

275
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,208
That side project just
prematurely blew up in my face.

276
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,666
You really are totally
lame, you know.

277
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,250
You half ass everything.

278
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,833
I mean, you couldn't give less
of a shit about killing ghosts.

279
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,416
Why would a thousand
dicks be any different?

280
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,375
Oh.

281
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,250
Guess what.

282
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,041
I have bad news, Panty.

283
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,208
Heaven is less than pleased

284
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,875
with your actions as
a degenerate whore.

285
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,166
You wanna show you're worthy,
go collect your own coins.

286
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,000
Until you've proved yourself,
you shall not pass!

287
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,541
Fuck!

288
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,958
This is such bullshit.

289
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,416
So I'm a slut, big deal.
Who are they to judge?

290
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,666
And why in fuck's name

291
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,458
do you seem happy about
all this, Flaccid Face?

292
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,958
How could I not be happy?

293
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,541
Panty and Brief are
back together again;

294
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,250
it may not be a big deal to you,
but I've never felt more alive!

295
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,875
You can call me
Smegma if it helps.

296
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,583
All right, you want it so bad?

297
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,791
You can have it; kill all the
ghosts you want, Geek Boy.

298
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,875
I'm fuckin' outta here.

299
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,500
Hey!

300
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,625
Panty, come back!

301
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,916
I don't wanna see your ass

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,958
until you've collected
some Heaven Coins!

303
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,416
No fair!

304
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,375
Nine hundred and
ninety nine fucks.

305
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,500
Goddamn it!

306
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,291
I figured I'd be at
a thousand by now.

307
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,458
I did not appreciate
that at all.

308
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,750
Well, look at who's here.

309
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,291
You better have
some fuckin' Heavens.

310
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:24,958
How could I?

311
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,541
I'm just a human;

312
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,708
I don't stand a chance against
that many ghosts all by myself!

313
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,500
Fuck that!

314
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,083
Don't give me excuses.

315
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,625
Dude, you are the most
useless guy I've ever met.

316
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,541
That is not true.

317
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,125
Oh, hey.

318
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,125
Hello, this is Briefers.

319
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,083
Hold on.

320
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,291
Again with the party?

321
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,041
No. No, I told you.

322
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,291
I don't wanna go!

323
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,166
On top of that,
I don't even know her!

324
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,375
I don't care about your stu--

325
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,916
So close-just one
more guy to go.

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,791
'Kay, now where the
hell am I gonna meet him.

327
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:18,875
Fuckin' A!

328
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,666
This place is out of control!

329
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,875
Okay, tell the truth,
how did a giant loser dork

330
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,000
like you get invited
to this party?

331
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,708
You're not so bad, after all!

332
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,333
Hey.

333
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,541
Where the fuck d'he go?

334
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,333
Hold on.

335
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,958
Yeah, this is Panty.

336
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,416
Where you at, slut?

337
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,958
I'm out hunting for ghosts
like I'm supposed to be doing.

338
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,250
Don't fucking lie to me, bitch!

339
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,666
The only thing you're
out hunting for

340
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,291
is more cock to bang, hell!

341
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,583
Shit!

342
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,625
Cross your legs and
focus for a second, Panty.

343
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,750
There's something
important about this

344
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,458
solo coin mission
I forgot to mention.

345
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,791
Oh, great. Like what?

346
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,166
How should I put this?

347
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,750
Uh... No fucking allowed!

348
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,666
Hell no!

349
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,375
That's a horseshit move, Afro.

350
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,083
I only need one more
dick to reach my goal,

351
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,291
and your ass knows it!

352
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
So, fuck you and
fuck your rules, too

353
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,583
You'll obey whether
you like it or not.

354
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,208
What the fuck, dude?

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,208
Are you kidding me?!

356
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,916
Damn it!

357
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,958
I just want to take a
moment to thank you all

358
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,166
for being here tonight

359
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,833
at the Rock Foundation's
celebrity event.

360
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,750
But, more importantly.

361
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,500
I have an announcement to make.

362
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,500
The daughter of my
good friend, the mayor,

363
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,708
is engaged to be married
to, none other than,

364
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,583
my own cherished son,
Briefers Rock.

365
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,375
Briefers!

366
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,583
Where are you, son?

367
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,625
What are you doing out
in the audience, son?

368
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,541
Come up to the stage and greet
your bride to be immediately.

369
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,041
I can't do that, Dad.

370
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,458
I'm sorry, but I refuse to
marry a girl I don't even like.

371
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
Excuse me?!

372
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,791
I mean it, Dad.

373
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,833
I'm not gonna be
your puppet anymore!

374
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,250
If you're trying to embarrass
me, son, you've succeeded.

375
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,291
I don't care!

376
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,916
You can listen
to me for a change!

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,625
That's the girl I want to marry.

378
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,250
Not her!

379
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,875
Why does she always
have to ruin everything?!

380
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,750
Sister, please.

381
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,833
We need to move on to Phase Two!

382
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,916
How can you do this to me in
front of all these people?

383
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,166
I can't believe my fiance's
been stolen by a trollop!

384
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,291
Darling, reconsider!

385
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,833
Grody! Get off of
me; no means no!

386
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,333
How dare you?

387
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,291
You're just a disgusting human!

388
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,291
How dare you cast me aside!

389
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,625
Sister, no!

390
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,625
Your horns are showing!

391
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,500
I don't care!

392
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,166
This is taking too long!

393
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,041
Fuck.

394
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,416
Bitch, what are you doing here?

395
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,250
We should be asking
you the same question!

396
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
It appears there is no need

397
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,416
to carry on this ridiculous
pretense any longer.

398
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Now once and for all.

399
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,166
You will realize
who is in control!

400
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,500
You freaks are way too
impressed with yourselves.

401
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,750
Bring it.

402
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,291
Because I'm in the mood
for a demon massacre.

403
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,666
Don't say I didn't warn you,
red twats; you're going down!

404
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,833
That creature
doesn't comprehend

405
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,791
the situation she's
in, does she?

406
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,958
I'd cry if it wasn't so funny.

407
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,250
Who's laughing now, bitches?

408
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,500
Say ta ta to that
neck of yours.

409
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,458
Come on!

410
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,458
Backlace, what the fuck?

411
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,291
Why aren't you working?!

412
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah.

413
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,375
That shit's fucked up.

414
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:38,916
Jesus!

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,666
Get it together!

416
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh my dear.

417
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,375
Don't you realize a
mere angel doesn't

418
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,500
stand a chance in
hell against us?

419
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,875
We're demons!

420
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,250
That truth has existed
since the dawn of creation!

421
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,791
It is our favorite rule.

422
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,291
Enjoy purgatory, you harlett.

423
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,750
You let go of her!

424
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,500
Pardon me?

425
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,750
No, I don't think I will!

426
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,791
I can't see anything, Scanty!

427
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,125
Where are you?

428
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,041
Let me go!

429
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,458
Stop!

430
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,791
I said stop!

431
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,583
That hurt!

432
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,875
What the fuck, dude?

433
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,625
Oh.

434
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,000
Sorry about that, Panty.

435
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
It's just I don't think you
stand much of a chance

436
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,750
against them without Stocking.

437
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
How the hell do you
know about Stockin'?

438
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
Hold on a minute.

439
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,250
Why are you acting like
you've forgotten who I am?

440
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,250
I'm Brief!

441
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,791
It's me.

442
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,958
Geek Boy? That's you?

443
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,458
Get the fuck out!

444
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
I didn't need your damn help!

445
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
Not to be rude, but yes you did.

446
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,375
They were gonna kill you.

447
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,916
I couldn't just sit
there and do nothing.

448
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,125
Now come on.

449
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
Let's get out of here
before they find us!

450
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,791
Fine.

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Fuck!

452
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
Seriously, See through!

453
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,583
Oh, come on.

454
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,500
Start already!

455
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,291
Motherfuck!

456
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,833
Not you too, girl.

457
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,416
God, this blows.

458
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,208
Well, at least we
should be safe out here.

459
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,041
Panty, did you know
you're touching me?

460
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,041
Yeah, I know.

461
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,625
I'm not sure why,
but I needed to.

462
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,458
Don't worry. I promise
I'll protect you!

463
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,791
There's no way I'd let
the woman I love get hurt.

464
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,958
You know I love you, right?

465
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,375
I mean, it's kinda weird
to say like this,

466
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,875
but I figured you already knew.

467
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,333
I've loved you ever
since we first met.

468
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,041
Please stop talking.

469
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,166
I wanna see your face again.

470
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,750
Hi, Panty.

471
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,250
You are so damn awkward.

472
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,500
But one thousand
might as well be you.

473
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,208
Shit.

474
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,000
Ouch!

475
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:55,875
What?

476
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,291
Wait!

477
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,458
Everything's fine; We'll
just try a different position.

478
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,375
No.

479
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,416
Doggie style?

480
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Oww!

481
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,541
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

482
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,333
Ow, no!

483
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,333
Why does it hurt?!

484
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,083
Whoa. Garter?

485
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,666
What are you doing here?!

486
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,416
Just as I thought.

487
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,083
Girl, you've been revirginized.

488
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,166
Yeah. The good news is
you're no longer a skank;

489
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,958
the bad news is you
have a hymen again.

490
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:30,833
Hymen?

491
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,875
You're fucking with me, right?

492
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,250
No, I'm not fucking
with you, and,

493
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,041
by the way, you should
count your slut blessings

494
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,416
Brief didn't actually
get all up in there.

495
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,583
A failure!

496
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,416
I'd expect no less from
an angel raised by you.

497
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,916
However, It was rather kind

498
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,208
of your protégé to assist
with the boy's awakening.

499
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,791
What are you
doing here, Corset?!

500
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,791
It's been a long time;
hasn't it, Garterbelt?

501
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,375
In truth, we haven't met
since "then," have we?

502
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,375
Mayor?

503
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,708
I didn't know that
you knew Garter.

504
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh yes. Now, my boy,
come to me.

505
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,708
It appears the descendent

506
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,750
of the Hell's Monkey has
been awoken by an angel's kiss.

507
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,625
Just a little nudge!

508
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,000
Finally, it's mine!

509
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,333
How wonderful.

510
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,166
Do you know how
long I've wanted you?

511
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,333
Why do you want my stumpy?

512
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,333
Go, Panty now!

513
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,750
Hurry up and get
Brief out of here!

514
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,708
Right!

515
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,708
You're not going anywhere!

516
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,625
Oh, look who it is, Sister.

517
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,291
The angel whore who can't
even have sex properly.

518
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,625
Do you believe she
thinks she can save him?

519
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,791
I don't believe this
one thinks at all!

520
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,708
Enough!

521
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,583
You're here to escort
the Hell's Monkey.

522
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,333
Yes, sir!

523
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,208
Toodle-oo.

524
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,416
We'll see you in hell.

525
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,125
Hah!

526
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,208
Panty!

527
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,958
Geek Boy!

528
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,541
Why?

529
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,083
I don't understand.

530
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,583
Oh, it seems we have
one less angel among us.

531
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,666
You're in for a hell
of a time, cupcake!

532
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,625
Who will protect you now?

533
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,041
Heaven doesn't want you, and
you've already failed your city.

534
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,541
You are powerless!
