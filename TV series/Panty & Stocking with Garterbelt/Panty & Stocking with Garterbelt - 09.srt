1
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,583
"If the Angels Wore Swimsuits."

2
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,625
You know how there
are those times

3
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,166
when you go see a
movie and ya think,

4
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,750
"I don't care what that's about;
I just want to see something

5
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,583
blow up for christsake and
squeeze my date's business.

6
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,208
Is that so wrong?" No!

7
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,416
In fact, it couldn't
be more right.

8
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,291
Today we've got a beach,
barely-there swimsuits,

9
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,166
and the obligatory
ghost-slash-monsteers

10
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,333
to help keep things exciting.

11
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,833
And that's about it.

12
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,541
Why are beaches so
fucking infested

13
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,041
with douchey horn balls, huh?

14
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,208
You smell that?

15
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,375
It's like this stanky
ass nose-cocktail

16
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,875
of sweat, pizza and
greasy desperation.

17
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,666
I'm gonna go ahead
and declare this

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,208
the day you learned
that I'm always right.

19
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,291
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,708
A private resort
would've been better.

21
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,166
Oh no! I spilled my drink.

22
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,875
Wow, can guys be fucking stupid.

23
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,458
I had a feeling you
guys were lying to me!

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,625
That is so not cool!

25
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,958
What are you doing here?

26
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,625
Doesn't the heat irritate
your acne or something?

27
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,958
Yes. It does.

28
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,666
You said you were too busy
to work the church stand

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,500
so I went and picked up
all the meat for you!

30
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,291
Yeah, we are busy.

31
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,333
Come eat my wieners!

32
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,500
So big and dark and juicy fresh!

33
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,083
Everyone says that
they're the best!

34
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,875
Dress them up and
suck them down,

35
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,083
my wieners are the
best in town!

36
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,041
Everyone loves my
thick dark wieners!

37
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,625
I can't service all
these people by myself.

38
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,416
Come on, you're angels,
you gotta help me!

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,625
That's so weird.

40
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,625
I could've sworn we
were busy on the beach

41
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,708
being hot and
getting hammered?

42
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:34,916
Perfect timing.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,583
Get your nerdy ass over here.

44
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,708
You want me to go over there?

45
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,166
How come?

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,041
Because you need to
rub oil all over me.

47
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,666
I guess I will
if you want me to.

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,875
I mean, are you sure?

49
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,541
Hurry before my buzz
wears off, fire crotch!

50
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,875
Goodness.

51
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,125
The pollution level
on our beach

52
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,541
has certainly escalated
since we've been away.

53
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,583
Never mind.

54
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,916
It's just those
moron angels again.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,458
Are you saying our lungs
are currently insufflating

56
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,583
the same air as them?

57
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,583
Disgusting.

58
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,041
What the fuck are
you doing here?

59
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,250
You had your moment!

60
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,916
Perhaps we should
ask you the same thing,

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,458
you see, the point of
having a private property

62
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,791
is that you get to keep
unwanted cretins out.

63
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,541
You own the beach?

64
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,791
Fuck that.

65
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,041
You can't just claim a
beach you whore-noceros.

66
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,750
Your ignorance is
failing miserably

67
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,333
at its attempt to be endearing.

68
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,708
We purchased this
spot months ago

69
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,583
because we were overdue
for a superlative vacation.

70
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,833
We figured keeping you
two out was worth the price,

71
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,625
but it doesn't
seem to be helping.

72
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,625
Fortunately for us,
we have other means.

73
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,416
Stop, drop and roll!

74
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,000
What's wrong with you?

75
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,791
No civilized person would rebel
so against legal restrictions!

76
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,666
Why is it that following simple
rules is so difficult for you?

77
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,083
Is it that you don't understand?

78
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,000
Are we simply speaking too
fast for you, ignoramuses?

79
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,166
Shut up!

80
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,375
You want us to go?
Then fuckin' make us!

81
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,041
Don't just stand
around bitchin,' bitch.

82
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,875
That would require me to touch
you and I'm allergic to slag.

83
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,916
Hooker say what?

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,125
Yes, fighting is
strictly prohibited

85
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,416
during vacation periods.

86
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,625
Please don't forget this.

87
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,250
It's one of our most vital--

88
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,333
--rules.

89
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,041
Fuck the shit out of all that!

90
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,375
Talk about your limp excuses.

91
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,833
You don't wanna fight
cuz you know we'd own you.

92
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,333
Why don't you just admit

93
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,291
that you're awesomely disgusting
and we can call it a day?

94
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,000
Ugh. You're talking, but
all I hear is flatulence.

95
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,791
You know, I think we can
solve this predicament

96
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,875
without compromising our rules.

97
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,583
There's a time-honored
method we demons use

98
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,916
which will serve us
rather wonderfully.

99
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,500
First point goes to Demons!

100
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,416
So we're gonna solve
this shit with volleyball.

101
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,708
Can't we just cut these bitches?

102
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
Well, it's the only
ball play those snatches

103
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,000
have a prayer of beating
me at, tell you what.

104
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,333
Are you through denigrating
our fine activity?

105
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,333
This game presents a
challenge to advance

106
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,500
both endurance and
gracefulness.

107
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,916
So maybe this wasn't terribly
fair given your common looks

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
and your--how shall I put this--

109
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,125
chemically unbalanced
personalities.

110
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,166
Panty!

111
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,291
One point, Angels!

112
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
I'm sorry, was that too
"unbalanced" for you?

113
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,666
Are you guys always that red

114
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,250
or is that just what
burned looks like?

115
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,916
They're not as
blunderous as I'd like.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,666
Their adequacy will
just make our victory

117
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,625
that much more rapturous.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,291
Yeah!

119
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,666
My wieners are all getting cold.

120
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,875
Where everyone at?

121
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,208
Damn angels.

122
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,708
Coulda used a couple
bikinis to draw in business.

123
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,583
What the hell's goin' on?

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Game point and
Angels win the match.

125
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,916
Oh no, did we do that?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,375
Aw yeah, we're just
getting warmed up!

127
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,500
How 'bout you not piss
off the red people, 'kay?

128
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,125
Ass dance! Ass dance!

129
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,125
That's not helping!

130
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,000
Angels!

131
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:33,750
Alright everyone final bets!

132
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,750
Demons verses angels!

133
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,041
Who's it gonna be?

134
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,166
Oh yeah, I totally
got this one!

135
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,875
Shit. What the hell happened?

136
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,166
How did it get back over there?

137
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,291
What's going on?

138
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,375
Boo!

139
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:54,291
Mother fuck!

140
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,458
You stupid ho!

141
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,916
Boo!

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,541
Boo!

143
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,416
Boo!

144
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,541
Boo!

145
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,458
Fuck that!

146
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,541
You can't just suck one minute

147
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,708
and then turn into
Gold Cup winners!

148
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,041
I don't know what
you're talking about.

149
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,625
We merely have
devilish technique.

150
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,791
How very typical.

151
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,250
You're simply
trying to distract

152
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,166
us with you ill-conceived
accusations.

153
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,708
All right, you
asked for this shit.

154
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,458
We are in the middle of a
game you Sulfuric Dollymop!

155
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,500
You can't abuse the rules
just because you're losing!

156
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,750
What?

157
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,125
This coming from a
cheating, yeasty hag troll

158
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,666
who turned her pet rat
into a fucking game ball?

159
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
If that's how they
want to play, then fine.

160
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,291
Balls up!

161
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,166
You're gonna get it!

162
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,291
Keep your rodent off this court

163
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,875
or I'll sue you for
spreading rabies!

164
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,958
Then sue your fat ass and your
nasty sister while you're at it!

165
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,416
Are you through
coming up with excuses?

166
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
We've been going easy
since you're hampered

167
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,625
by your heavy hamhocks
and miniscule IQs.

168
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,958
However if you'd
like to play for real?

169
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,166
Bring it on, ho bags!

170
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,583
Now, of course,

171
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,208
this isn't just a means to
get you off our property.

172
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,541
The loser will have to pay
some additional penalties.

173
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,208
Whoever fails has to
get completely naked.

174
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,041
So the audience has to suffer?

175
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,208
Yeah, why punish
everyone else for your loss?

176
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,291
At least throw some bleach

177
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,083
on your ass so we don't
catch skankitis!

178
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,125
You guys might want to pull out.

179
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,625
They look pretty mean right now.

180
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,708
Shut up!

181
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,333
Safe-Guard With Wings!

182
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,541
Demonic Tight Spinner!

183
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,541
Cradle in the dark!

184
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,583
Vibrating Butterfly
and Rabbit Destroyer!

185
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,416
Final Climactic
Double Angel Slammer!

186
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,875
You can't get this
shit on ESPN, bro.

187
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:57,833
I can't see, dammit!

188
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,666
Ang--Dem-- wait!

189
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,875
It's going too freaking fast.

190
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,625
I can't change the scores!

191
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,791
Who? What? Dammit.

192
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,041
What is happening here?

193
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,083
Final point!

194
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,750
You ready?

195
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,666
Go!

196
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,541
Fly, Sister!

197
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,916
Well this has been
rather diverting

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,625
but it's time to wrap
things up, what do you say?

199
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,333
Stockin'!

200
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,958
Got it!

201
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,333
Perfect shot!

202
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,375
Game over!

203
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,375
You're about to
get hardcore served!

204
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:52,666
Repent, bitches!

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,375
Wait.

206
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,458
Does this mean we lost?

207
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,458
Crum cake.

208
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,875
Well.

209
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,458
Which one of you wants to
get butt ass naked first?

210
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,458
Your fans're ready to
make it rain up in here!

211
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,875
Take it off!

212
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,625
Take it off! Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!

213
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,208
Take it off! Take it
off! Take it off!

214
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:12,375
Take it off! Take it off!
Take it off! Take it off!

215
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,416
Gotcha!

216
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,208
Maybe they can make
some ghost sushi.

217
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,875
You really have the most
delicious sense of humor!

218
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,458
I hope there aren't any
hard feelings, of course.

219
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,416
We had a great time!

220
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,333
Bye bye now!

221
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,708
We'll see you two later!

222
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,250
Wait!

223
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,791
Get back here!

224
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,541
No, Panty!

225
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,458
Just hold on, I'll save you!

226
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,666
After I get this seaweed
ghost off my face!

227
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,666
And I thought
I had crabs before!

228
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,916
Let me go!

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,041
Stockin', what the fuck do you
think you're doing?

230
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,000
It's so tight I can't move.

231
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,666
You're sick!

232
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,750
Shit! Stupid fucking starfish!

233
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,916
Fuck! Stupid sea urchin!

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,666
Well that was a
most triumphant day.

235
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,666
Everything went precisely
as you had planned

236
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,708
and I was actually starting
to enjoy myself playing

237
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,625
with those nimwits,
can you believe it?

238
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,583
What's the matter?

239
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,958
Sea whores!

240
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,000
Why did we ever allow
them to defeat us like that?

241
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,416
I hope they enjoyed
every second of it

242
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,541
because it will never be
permitted it to happen again!

243
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,041
Next time, they die!

244
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,791
That's the self-destruct button!

245
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,250
What is the point
of that button?

246
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,208
Who would choose to use it?

247
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,500
Ew!

248
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:47,458
Is everybody okay?

249
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,833
Get the fuck off!

250
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,291
Oh, that's sensitive.

251
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,083
What is? Oh boy.

252
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,208
Who's flippin' them green
backs lookin' like a pimp?

253
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,625
A sperm whale ghost?

254
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,958
No way!

255
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,000
"Ghost: The Phantom
of Daten City."

256
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,208
Okay, well then
what about that guy?

257
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,916
He's hot enough and
looks like he's packing.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,375
Packing gen'-warts maybe.

259
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,166
Plus I can see his
man-boobs from here.

260
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,166
I don't think so.

261
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,291
What?

262
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,291
Back-Pack Dude then?

263
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,833
You mean Awkward Dude?

264
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,833
He's the one that learns all
his moves from old-school pornos

265
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,416
and wants you to
call his junk by name.

266
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,250
What about him?

267
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,041
Geriatric.

268
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,125
Jesus. Him?

269
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:43,875
Virgin!

270
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,208
What the fuck?

271
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,541
You can't tell me you
wouldn't grease his pole.

272
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,875
Not even if it was covered
with buttercream icing.

273
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,375
Where are your standards?

274
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,958
Oh I'm sorry.

275
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,875
Should I wait to see how they
fare in the talent competition?

276
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,000
Look, it's all the same when
you're face down anyway.

277
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,291
Great. Then you go get
you some, Helen Keller.

278
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
I'll stay here

279
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,916
and wait for someone that
doesn't make me want to hurl.

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,125
Your call.

281
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,250
But I say you might
as well give your vag

282
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,833
to Goodwill if
you're not using it.

283
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,708
You just have to
set the nookie bar

284
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,083
a little higher if you
want ultimate satisfaction.

285
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,875
What? When you're as
sophisticated as my ass,

286
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,166
that bar don't mean shit.

287
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,541
You wouldn't understand
sophistication

288
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,875
if you were bound
and gagged with it.

289
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,041
Now that's some hot shit.

290
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,250
Ladies, babies, mommas!

291
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,541
C'mon, just a quick stick.

292
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,750
I promise, I'll go easy!

293
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,291
How 'bout I take you out and buy
you something pretty after, huh?

294
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,541
What do you say, girl?

295
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,416
Just the tip?

296
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,916
Gross.

297
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,875
Being a nasty ghost is bad
enough but that one looks like

298
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,166
he probl'y found his face in
a blender full of donkey shit.

299
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:37,833
Ew.

300
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,916
He's fucking farting!

301
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,791
And P.S. he's
trying to get laid.

302
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,750
I say we put him
out of their misery.

303
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,875
Where'd you go?

304
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,333
Seriously?

305
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,916
Hotness!

306
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,541
What the fuck?

307
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,041
You're dating a fucking ghost?

308
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,041
Damn straight!

309
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,791
Is there something
wrong with that?

310
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,750
Gee.

311
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:07,916
Lemme think.

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Everything is wrong with that.

313
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,000
It was love at first smell.

314
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,708
Uh... Say what?

315
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,791
I mean first sight.

316
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,000
I knew from the
moment I saw his face.

317
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,166
We hadn't spoken but
something inside me felt like

318
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,166
I had known him my entire life.

319
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,791
It was magic!

320
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,291
We were made for each other!

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,666
Hi!

322
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,625
Have you been waiting long?

323
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:42,833
Yeah.

324
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:43,750
Forever.

325
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,083
I was about to leave your ass.

326
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,083
Lucky you made it.

327
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,416
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,875
I wanted to make sure
I looked perfect for you.

329
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,750
Lemme break this to you slow.

330
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,833
I don't give a fuck
what you look like.

331
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,291
Ah.

332
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,000
He's so sexy!

333
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
Here, try one.

334
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,125
I know it's not your thing,
but most people like them.

335
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,291
Did you wash your hands?

336
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,291
I don't want germs, you know.

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,833
Yeah right. You're a girl.

338
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,916
Girls like to lie and
make food mixed with germs.

339
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,125
C'mon, say 'Ah!'

340
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,000
So fragrant!

341
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,625
Smells like love.

342
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,125
Tastes like old cheese.

343
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,166
Get it out of my sight.

344
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,250
Don't you chicks know my momma's
the only woman who can cook?

345
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,291
Maybe if it had a
little more salt.

346
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
I love you!

347
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,333
A whole lotta "fuck that"!

348
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,958
Yeah, I heard
they're gonna adopt.

349
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,541
What are you all looking at?

350
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,083
Fuck me!

351
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,041
Stockin'!

352
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,500
Get your ass out here!

353
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,541
This is an intervention, dammit!

354
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,125
You're making a mistake!

355
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,666
He looks like an
inside-out ass hole,

356
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,916
smells like egg
salad, and oh yeah!

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,041
You're supposed to kill him.

358
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,916
Everyone's laughing
at you which means

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,083
they're laughing at me
and that is no bueno!

360
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,750
Now that there is
one impressive angle.

361
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,958
My own sister, trying
to shit on my joy.

362
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,791
She's just jealous cuz
none of her relationships

363
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,458
last longer than a blowjob.

364
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,791
I know you can hear me, bitch.

365
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,458
Don't even front.

366
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,541
Okay, check it out.

367
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,625
I know it's not about his looks.

368
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,791
I get that you're not in love

369
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,625
with the smell or the
fat or the warts.

370
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,166
It's who he is 'n shit, right?

371
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,458
Well let me remind
you that he's a ghost!

372
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,458
He shouldn't be allowed
to exist much less fuc--

373
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,333
Shut up!

374
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,208
True love has no restrictions!

375
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,041
Even so. I don't think I can

376
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,708
keep this angel thing from
him very much longer.

377
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,541
Why do I even watch
that turd munching team?

378
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,625
It's like they flipped
on TV one day and decided

379
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,416
"Hey, I can play sports"

380
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
and some moron put
them on the field!

381
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,958
Hell, I'm just
watching it now to see

382
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,416
if someone breaks their
neck so I can laugh.

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,083
Know what I mean?

384
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,083
Yeah.

385
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,833
Hey, can we talk?

386
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,958
I haven't exactly been
honest about who I am.

387
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,125
I'm sorry.

388
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,583
Okay?

389
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,916
I hope you can forgive me.

390
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,375
I'm actually an angel.

391
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,375
What's this about anal?

392
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,166
No, I said I'm an angel
on a mission from Heaven.

393
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,958
Our whole purpose
here is to kill ghosts.

394
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,625
Meaning you.

395
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,208
I should've killed
you at 'hello'.

396
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,041
Whoa! Wait! Hold the door!

397
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,125
I never asked you to tell
me about your anal thing.

398
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,666
There's no need to kill me!

399
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,458
No, you big lump.

400
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,333
I'm trying to tell you
I don't care about my duty!

401
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,375
I love you, that's
all that matters!

402
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,833
Even if it means I have
to give up being an angel!

403
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,541
I want you to run away with me.

404
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,583
You mean.

405
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,958
You want to elope?

406
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,666
Yes, and I don't
care what the cost is

407
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,416
or if I ever get back to Heaven.

408
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,375
It's worth it if it
means I can be with you.

409
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,125
Well, shit, she's not leaving
me much of a choice here is she?

410
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,250
Looks like you beat me.

411
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,833
You been waiting long?

412
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,083
Something kinda came up.

413
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,208
But ya know after that I took
a cab and rushed to get here.

414
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,750
Uh. Oh yeah, I'm gonna
need you to pay the dude.

415
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,500
I'm strapped.

416
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,958
Don't tip him too big
though. I'm starving.

417
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,708
I need some wings
before we take off.

418
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,250
In fact, fuck the tip, you
probably want to eat too, right?

419
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,083
You really know how to
charm a girl don't you,

420
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,458
you waste of space loser.

421
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,708
If you're that hungry,

422
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,916
then I've got some
lead you can chew on,

423
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,083
so open up, stank cheeks.

424
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,458
Who are you? What's going on?

425
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,958
I'm your worst nightmare.

426
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,375
My name's Panty, and
I'm Stockin's big sister.

427
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,041
Bad news, you guys
are breaking up!

428
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,833
She couldn't have told
me that over the phone?

429
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
Hard to date someone if you're
just a dead-ass shit stain.

430
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,416
Ain't it?

431
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,958
Now repent, motherfucker!

432
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,625
You hurt him

433
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,333
and you'll feel three times
his pain, I swear to crap.

434
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,041
Oh come on.

435
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,250
Sis, I'm just trying to protect
you like I always have. Right?

436
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,916
Don't say that!
We're not sisters anymore!

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,166
I'm my own person!

438
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,375
You're shitting me!

439
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,791
There's a fuck ton
of guys out there.

440
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,916
You don't need to boil
rabbits about a ghost!

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,958
Stop saying it like that!

442
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,208
He's more than
just a ghost to me!

443
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,750
You wouldn't understand!

444
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,708
You're too busy fucking
to know what love is!

445
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,666
What? You think that's love?

446
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,458
I may not know what love is
but that sharter doesn't either!

447
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,708
He treats you like ass!

448
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,750
It's not true!

449
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,541
I do love her!

450
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,083
I'm sorry. I know I haven't
been good at showing it.

451
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,666
I'm not a very smart man.

452
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,458
But I know what love is, Panty!

453
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,541
Oh gross.

454
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,958
Omigosh no way!

455
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,041
The pawn shop let
me get it on layaway.

456
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,166
I love you, Stocking.
I always have.

457
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,708
Ditto.

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,666
I object! By reason of--

459
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,625
Oh don't act like you approve
of this all of a sudden!

460
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,958
Simmer the fuck down, hooker.

461
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,916
I can't explain it but
it's so clear to me now,

462
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,041
the reason I was put here.

463
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,791
I was never going
to find happiness

464
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,583
until it found me--
until you found me.

465
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,708
You complete me.

466
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,875
You make me want to be
a better man, Stocking.

467
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:35,708
See ya.

468
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,625
Good-bye.

469
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,208
There are those who
live their entire lives

470
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,916
without experiencing the
love of another person.

471
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,875
We call them bachelors.

472
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,708
Their loneliness and
regret combined

473
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,708
to embody that pitiful ghost.

474
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,625
Even though it was
only for a short time.

475
00:21:55,708 --> 00:22:00,041
Finally letting himself love has
allowed him to rest in peace.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,750
Cheesy much?
God, I'm glad he's dead.

477
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,875
You in there, Shitterella?

478
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,000
It's time to go
kill some ghosts!

479
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,500
I'll even let you bang
a few if you hurry!

480
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,208
Fuck that. She can
stew in it for a while.
