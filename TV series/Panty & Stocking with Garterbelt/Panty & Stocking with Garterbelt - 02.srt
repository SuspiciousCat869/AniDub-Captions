1
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,708
"The Turmoil of the Beehive."

2
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,750
One more time with feeling!

3
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,083
Daten City.

4
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,583
Sometimes it feels like
a vacuous place

5
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,416
where everyone
wants to be number one.

6
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,208
Especially in high school.

7
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,000
The guys want the
girls to want them,

8
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,708
and the girls want the other
girls to want to be them.

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,833
However, sometimes, being the
best means being the worst.

10
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,041
Good morning, angels!

11
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,500
It's so nice of you
to grace us with

12
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,625
your most malcontent
presence today.

13
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,375
This is who I'm
waking up to? Asshole.

14
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,916
I'm not gonna stop
what I was doing,

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,291
so you only have
yourself to blame

16
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,375
for what you're about to
smell, preacher douche bag.

17
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,625
I'm gonna ignore
that and keep talkin'.

18
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,958
Alright, Tartlettes.

19
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,708
We have a grave
situation on our hands.

20
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,166
Yeah, I'll bet.

21
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,625
Let me guess: it's another
rogue glory hole shit storm.

22
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,833
The only shit storm here

23
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,291
is the one coming out of
your mouth on a daily basis.

24
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,875
But I prepared for it this time.

25
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,208
Ladies and Panty,
meet our new client,

26
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,458
the principal of Daten
City's academic institution.

27
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,958
We only have one
here, apparently.

28
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:11,750
Client for what?

29
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,333
I don't do old dudes.

30
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,666
Oh well that's just,
oh, never mind.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,208
The thing is our
students are missing--

32
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,875
or rather,
they're going missing.

33
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,750
Ouch!

34
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,166
Some of them are still there.

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,708
I've called the police,
but they can't figure it out.

36
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,791
And there must be a
ghost behind it, right?

37
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,041
Can I go now?

38
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,375
It's more than a ghost!
It's the Devil himself!

39
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,958
Please, save our school!

40
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,333
Oh Jiminy that feels amazing!
Just a little to the left and--

41
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,250
Leg rape?

42
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,416
Way to have him
ask for our help

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,958
like we fucking have
the right to say no.

44
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,208
I knew you'd agree!

45
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,625
All right, ya hookers,

46
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,333
go wash your asses in the sink
and get to high school

47
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,250
before that ghost swindles
any more students.

48
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,500
Remember, you're incognito

49
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,791
so resist the urge
to be yourselves.

50
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,625
Are those celebrities?

51
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,375
Are we in a music video?

52
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
We're angels, dick!

53
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,416
Uh, you do know what
incognito means, right?

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,875
It's the opposite of that.

55
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,750
Who'd've thunk the
Earthly high school boys'd

56
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,125
be just as pervy as
those assholes in Heaven.

57
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,458
That was convincing.

58
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,958
For a minute I actually
believed you had some idea

59
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,583
what schools might
be like up there.

60
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,416
I specifically said the perverts
at the schools, Stockin'.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,333
I wouldn't know that
if I actually wasted time

62
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,791
in a class now would I?

63
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,833
True story. All right,
let's get this over with.

64
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,416
Where should we go first?

65
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,791
What in the fuck? That's not
suspicious or anything.

66
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,166
We didn't even have to
go looking for trouble.

67
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,625
Ugh. Was that necessary?

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Whoa. Holy Mary Mother 'a--

69
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,750
That all you got?

70
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,791
Hey! Here's a thought!

71
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,208
Let's take this one
home and call it a day!

72
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,083
Yeah, we'll say he's a geeky
Bee Ghost or something.

73
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,375
I'm down.

74
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,791
Help! I can't see
and my face hurts!

75
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,041
Oh, Briefers, Darling?

76
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,166
You're not really running
around so carelessly

77
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,750
with my precious beehive
on your head now are you?

78
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,125
It's Barby!

79
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,083
I'm so sorry!

80
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,875
But it's not my fault I swear!

81
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,833
Aw that was a
good look for you.

82
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,708
Why'd you take it off?

83
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,500
So, hey. What the fuck is that?

84
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,875
Ew gross. Is that
Barby wannabe I smell?

85
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,083
I have no idea who you are or
who you're pretending to be,

86
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,875
but allow me to share
something really important

87
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,666
with you--this
school belongs to moi.

88
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,000
You the fuckin' janitor?

89
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,791
Yeah 'cause we met the
principal and he's hotter.

90
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,208
My name's Barby.

91
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,291
You may also refer
to me as Queen Barby,

92
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,333
Her Majesty, or Goddess.

93
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,583
Allow them to demonstrate.

94
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,416
Hail Barby! Queen Barby!
Her Majesty! Goddess!

95
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,458
You're working
way too hard here.

96
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,500
Did she seriously refer
to herself as Barby?

97
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,583
Like the out-dated
fetish doll

98
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,375
with a zillion
lame-ass occupations?

99
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,083
She did and I'm
allergic to plastic.

100
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,166
Let's get out of here
before we catch "Slut-Face."

101
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,166
Oh no.

102
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,833
No one walks out in the
middle of my being worshiped!

103
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
And how dare you
call me plastic!

104
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,000
I guess I was
just born with it!

105
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,916
Look how hot I am as a
scientist. Hard on!

106
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,333
--Go!
--Go!

107
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,541
Go!

108
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,166
Kay?

109
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,333
Take notes my nerdlings.

110
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,333
Man, those Panty
and Stocking babes

111
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,125
totally deleted Barby
from everyone's playlist.

112
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,083
Consider her beta test expired.

113
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,375
Yeah, right. I don't
know what that means

114
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,250
but I'm ready for a new
mental image for my flesh light.

115
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,583
Bye Bye Barby!

116
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,958
My brother nerds!
The time has come to assimilate!

117
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,791
We must wipe our hard
drives clean of that nasty virus

118
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,083
and hail our new
splendiferous royalty!

119
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,958
I know I didn't just hear
what I think I thought I heard.

120
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,666
Try that again, suckers!

121
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,291
Listen up, maggots!

122
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,333
You're still
practically embryos!

123
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,000
And that means if you
have sex you'll die!

124
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:12,708
I mean it!

125
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,208
And death is permanent!

126
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,333
Check this shit out, Stockin'.
Could you just die?

127
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,625
It even moves when you
stick a finger up her.

128
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,166
Third Base
Panty--Collect all four.

129
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,583
You're just into
this for the uniform.

130
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,250
And your point?

131
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,083
Is that gum? Thanks, bro.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,958
Hey! What are you girls doing?

133
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,083
What the fuck, sphincter?

134
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh, hey Geek Boy.
Didn't see ya there.

135
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,916
You've gotta do something!

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,333
All my friends
are disappearing,

137
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,833
and by friends I mean
the people in the halls!

138
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,750
What's that?

139
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,000
This is the work of a ghost!

140
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,500
They're gonna kidnap us
all and eat our brains!

141
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,500
They're gonna what now?
Dude, slow your fuckin' roll.

142
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,083
I can't understand you.

143
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,208
You may not believe this, but
I am an expert in the occult.

144
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,916
Plus I got this Proton
Pack for my birthday

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
last year and it's awesome.

146
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,583
Those things are for real?

147
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,333
Man, I hope whoever gave you
that thing kept the receipt

148
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,500
because it's either broken as
hell or just part of their plan

149
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,250
to make you look like
a comic-con dee-ouche.

150
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,000
So, what exactly were we taking

151
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,916
when we decided to follow
the Ginger Freak-fro-show.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,833
Sorry, it usually works!

153
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,041
Proton Pack of Shit!

154
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,000
Wait, no! There it goes!
It found something!

155
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,500
I knew I could fix it!

156
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,166
Well, isn't this a delight?

157
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,625
I was afraid I'd never
see my favorite

158
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,958
slut cankles ever again!

159
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,833
Aren't you supposed
to be in the trash?

160
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,583
That entrance is
way too big for you.

161
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,916
Please.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,125
I have the biggest entrances
in the whole school!

163
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,416
That's a lot of
information about you

164
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,791
I did not need to know.

165
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,916
Booger flick in your face.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,291
Aw. That was almost adorable.

167
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,625
I'll give you something
to flick when you see

168
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,541
what I've brought
here for you.

169
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm terrified beyond the
capacity for rational thought!

170
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,708
Could this have been any
more fuckin' predictable?

171
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,625
Nope, she's a queen.
She's a bee.

172
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,541
She's a queen bee,
we fucking get it.

173
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,666
I hope you both have
something good to turn in

174
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,625
to Teacher Barby
because stupidity

175
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,875
results in death
in my classroom!

176
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,875
Introducing, Brain Slushy Barby!

177
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,541
This better not take forever.
I need a candy bar!

178
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,750
True that mess.
Who's ready to play?

179
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Barby Blast!

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,041
They certainly have experience
playing with balls, don't they?

181
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,666
It was all a dream.
Oh, thank goodness.

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,500
Heads up, Ginge!

183
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:58,541
Just who are
these helmeted men?

184
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,250
Make my day!
Bee gone!

185
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,916
My head hurts.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,458
Was I just a bee?

187
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,833
Uh not exactly.

188
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,875
Random House Barby
decided to put

189
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,000
bees in your ears
to control you.

190
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,333
So you know what that means.

191
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,041
It's Extermination
Day, bee-itches!

192
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,791
Panty, I'm gonna need you
to stop making bee puns!

193
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,666
It's about to get all
Bring It Barby in here!

194
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,208
Get your asses out there
and give them poison!

195
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,083
Did she just shoot
bee butts at us?

196
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,750
I see London.
I see France!

197
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,166
You're up!

198
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,708
We girls can do anything!
Ain't that right, Barby?

199
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,041
Barby Dream Cemetery
sold separately!

200
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,916
Repent, motherfucker!

201
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,208
But I'm vintage!

202
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,625
That's it?
Cheap bastard.

203
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,125
Here come the geeks.

204
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,125
Holy shit you guys
are real ghost hunters!

205
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm so excited I'm itching!

206
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh! But in places
I shouldn't be!

207
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,500
Wait until people
hear about this!

208
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,916
A few of them will want to
be friends with me, I know it!

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,750
Hello smorgasm-bord!

210
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,916
Whose face should I play
'rocking chair' with first?

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, I guess you've earned it.

212
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,208
Line up, boys.

213
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,750
I need some sugar.

214
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,833
Don't put your finger there!

215
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,708
Please don't put
your finger there!

216
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,541
I must exorcise this demon!

217
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
What the fuck are you doing?

218
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,500
Put your finger back!

219
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,958
Touch down!

220
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, let's go into overtime!

221
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,791
"Sex and the Daten City!"

222
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,875
I don't see no ghost.

223
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,000
Who you gonna call,
mother bitches?

224
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,125
Coming, this winter.

225
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,916
All I want is for him
to tell me I'm 'the one'.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Is that too much to ask?

227
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,625
I'm sorry but he's
just not that into you.

228
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,333
Girlfriend, fuck you!

229
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,041
That's it, Panty!

230
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,541
Work it, baby, yeah!

231
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,541
That's it! Be the
tiger! Be the tiger!

232
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,208
Meow.

233
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,875
Great! That's a wrap!

234
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,041
You were un-effing-believable
today, Panty!

235
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,208
Tell me something I don't know.
When can we go shopping?

236
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,625
That's going to have
to wait til next week.

237
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,458
Right now you have three
commercials for hair products,

238
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,041
a talk show with
four bitter lesbians

239
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,208
and then you need to make
an appearance at a party.

240
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
Careful not to flash
the naughty bits.

241
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,125
Fabulous. I'd also like
to break a window

242
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,166
and design a cheap,
trashy teen fashion line.

243
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
That's the best idea I've
ever heard in my entire life!

244
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,166
I'm gonna pencil that
shit in right now!

245
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
Meeting with Bubbles
next Tuesday,

246
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,208
and it's Blossom's
birthday week.

247
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,625
Send a Louis with a card
signed, "Love, Panty."

248
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,291
You know what else?
I want to make a CD!

249
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,750
I'm tired of all
these rumors starting

250
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,750
and sick of being followed
and I need to sing about it!

251
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,166
Oh! I can't think
of a better way

252
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,375
to get the public to
leave you alone!

253
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,208
We'll get Timber
Brand to produce!

254
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
Take that, America!

255
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,125
Yay!

256
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,875
'Innocent, yet sexy' are
the words most commonly used

257
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,708
to describe the luscious
young sex symbol

258
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,291
who has recently
made a comeback.

259
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,250
No more dangling babies over
balconies or breaking windows.

260
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,916
Panty has made
a fresh new start!

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,083
Shitballs-- She is not
that innocent! Ugh.

262
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,416
Come on.

263
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,375
I just had a pudding-gasm!

264
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,958
Best sticky goo
in my mouth all day!

265
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:15,958
She's here.

266
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,208
Ten thousand years
later. Whore.

267
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,208
How's it going
over there, Panty?

268
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,791
Just dandy.

269
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,875
Hey remember that time you made
a really fucked up commercial?

270
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,500
Glaze my donut!
Eat my donut!

271
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,000
I've got a donut for you!

272
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,208
Fuck me with a chainsaw!

273
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,250
Girl, that was hilarious!

274
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,750
Suck a cow tit, skank!

275
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,000
Only if you're serving it
with your glazed donut holes.

276
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Too bad you got fired.

277
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,625
I wasn't fired.

278
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,083
I just refuse to sell out
unlike some whores I know.

279
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,791
I prefer to keep it on the DL.

280
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,750
I don't want to fuck up
our premiere, unlike you.

281
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,125
Fine.
Sit there and flick it

282
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,458
while my pampered white ass
gets famous without ya.

283
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,458
That reminds me, make
sure to warn the ushers

284
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,916
at the movie
to leave an extra seat

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
for that pampered ass
to spread out.

286
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,125
Thank you so much for
coming here tonight!

287
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:08,416
We've both been looking
forward to this day! Mwah!

288
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,458
Some might say we're
just in it for the money,

289
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,250
but that's only partly true.
We do it for you guys!

290
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,000
Can you believe it,
ladies and gentlemen?

291
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,916
Roman Polanski
was released from prison

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
just so he could
direct this risqué film.

293
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,250
Sex and the Daten
City is a real hit!

294
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,000
And as a bonus,
tonight also marks

295
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,875
Miss Panty's on screen debut!

296
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,625
Did you just suggest that
this was my first time

297
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,250
for anything,
schlong breath?

298
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,333
You know who I am?

299
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,416
I make movies all the time!

300
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,916
This is number two, ya dick.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,541
Bring it on, Chuck meister.

302
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,875
What did you just
pull out of your ass?

303
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,333
Oh please.
Like you don't know.

304
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,625
Here, why'ncha throw this on.

305
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,958
And next time do some
mother fucking research!

306
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,291
Debut my ass! Fuckwit!

307
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,333
Wait.

308
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,750
I forgot to put
on panties today.

309
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,500
What a strange coincidence.

310
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,458
I'm not wearing anything
under these jeans either.

311
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,791
Oh, then I guess we'll
have to fuck, won't we?

312
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,291
Fuck me proper! Fuck me proper!

313
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,958
Not a whole lot of
actresses in this town

314
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,458
can handle a role that huge,

315
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
but the director knew
I had what it takes.

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,625
We're gonna need
some hush money!

317
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,166
Oh make me work for it!

318
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,208
Make. Me. Work! Oh... yeah!

319
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,500
The director said I'm
the best he's ever had.

320
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,250
They're talking Oscars!
Cannes Festival!

321
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,958
Even 24 Hour Video Races, which
is great if you're into that

322
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,208
and I'm pretty sure I am.

323
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,250
Hey, how jealous of
me are you right now?

324
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,291
What the fuck?
Put it back on!

325
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,083
Seriously. He's about
to hog-tie me.

326
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,208
You don't wanna miss it.

327
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,583
What the hell were
you thinking, Panty?

328
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,166
My god, were you
even thinking at all?

329
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,125
Betsey Johnson!
Your "debut film" is porn!

330
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,333
You made a sex tape!

331
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,541
What! Serious?

332
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,125
As genital warts.

333
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,000
So it was just
"direct to video"?

334
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,583
Well, that explains why
I haven't won an Oscar, yet.

335
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,916
That's not it!

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
There's a bigger problem!
You don't understand--

337
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,625
I'm not any good?

338
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,041
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

339
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,291
Oh no, you're very good, honey.
That's not the point.

340
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,833
What the fuck is the
point then? Shit!

341
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,750
The point is you have
three brain cells left

342
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,333
and they're all fighting
for your attention.

343
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,750
Why would you play
your crackerfied porno

344
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,916
during our movie premiere?

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,458
Now it's all anyone
can think about.

346
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,750
I hate to be
the one to pretend to

347
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,291
hate to be the one
to break it to you,

348
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,416
but leaking sex tapes is
known as career suicide!

349
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,458
So it's over?
No more group sex?

350
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,791
No more naked men
covered in sushi?

351
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,625
No more spring break body shots?

352
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,333
God, I hate it here!

353
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,666
I know, why don't
you go shoplift--

354
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
it'll take the edge off?

355
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,625
Hold the ball sac,
I've got an idea!

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,791
Fuck it! The whole
thing never happened!

357
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,041
That was easier than
I thought it would be.

358
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,750
I do love happy endings!

359
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,750
You stupid constipation!

360
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,041
That was one copy!

361
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,291
Someone already put
that shit on the internet!

362
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,291
Can you imagine
fucking that ape in HD,

363
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,291
or better yet, how's
Blu-ray sound to you?

364
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,708
Dammit!

365
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,833
How slow can you possibly be?

366
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,958
God just did not design
you for thinking did he?

367
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,458
Either that or He put
your brain in your clit.

368
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,208
I don't know what the fuck kind
of shit you're trying to say

369
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,916
but I know it reeks
of asshole, asshole!

370
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,625
Why don't you just admit
that you're jealous?

371
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,333
It kills you to see my
classic bone structure

372
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,375
and ass that won't
quit on the big screen!

373
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,625
No need to clean up!

374
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,000
My maid will get--
what the fuck?

375
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,916
Guess your ass-that-won't-
quit was too much for them

376
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,291
or maybe they don't
want their careers

377
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
to sink along with yours.

378
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,708
Send me some post
cards from Has-Been City.

379
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:30,750
I mean, why give up porn for a
legitimate movie career, right?

380
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,625
Maybe I over
reacted a little bit.

381
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,916
You really are
the sweetest,

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,958
smartest little shit
in the world.

383
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,000
Have I told you how fuckable
you are to me right now?

384
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,416
Seriously. Everyone should
have a sister like you.

385
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,666
Creepy.

386
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm only doing this for
the movie, by the way.

387
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,166
Of course. What's the plan?

388
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,708
I managed to grab
a list of buyers

389
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,166
from your porn distributer
and we are going to pay a visit

390
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,416
to every single perv on it!

391
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,666
You are one brilliant bitch!

392
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,708
Great donut hole!
It's Panty Anarchy!

393
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,125
Baby squirrel tits!

394
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,916
I can't believe
Deep Throat Pantella of

395
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,541
'Hot and Horney
Baby Doll Bitches'

396
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,291
is actually in
my room right now!

397
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,291
You breathe one word
of this to anyone

398
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,833
and I'll come back here and blow
your freaky loser brains out,

399
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,083
and I mean with a gun!
You want that, fucknut?

400
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,458
I don't!

401
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,666
You haven't made any copies
of that shit have you?

402
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,666
No ma'am!

403
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,625
Right answer!
Let's go, Stockin!

404
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,958
Eat it! It'll put
hair on your chest!

405
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,208
That's bullshit!

406
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:34,750
If you don't eat the
red ones, you'll die!

407
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,125
More bullshit!

408
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:36,666
And if you don't eat the
orange ones you'll go blind!

409
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,708
Bullshit!

410
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,083
Bye! See you later!

411
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,875
What the fuck?
Are you serious?

412
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,000
You're selling this
masterpiece for two bucks?

413
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,333
I'm worth more than that!

414
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,291
Mmm. Nothing like a
wine break to refresh.

415
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,041
So Giza's next? Where the
fuck is that? Florida?

416
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:00,875
Egypt.

417
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Ooh yabba ya ali baba oble
moogle ya ya curry rice...

418
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,833
Gross! He hid it in
his camel's face!

419
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,833
I saved the day again!

420
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,833
Panty! We can leave now!

421
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,708
Ha ha!

422
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,458
Yeah!

423
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,041
Fuck me proper! Fuck me proper!

424
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,791
Open wide, Chucky.

425
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,625
I found it!

426
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,375
It's over here!

427
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,541
Got it!

428
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
That jackwagon had five copies!

429
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,250
Ugh where were you hiding this?

430
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,458
It's covered in goo but
I'm pretty sure this is it.

431
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,500
So where did you
say the last one is?

432
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,333
Oh fuck!

433
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,916
How 'bout that? You're
in a space spank bank!

434
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,250
Whatever.
At least it's over with.

435
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,166
You know, it wouldn't
hurt to keep just one.

436
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,791
Yeah, I mean it
was your film debut.

437
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,833
Give it to me and I'll keep
it somewhere safe for you.

438
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,791
If anyone has my porn,
it should be you.

439
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,125
One more time!

440
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,666
Some might say we're just
in it for the money,

441
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,500
but that's only partly true.

442
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,416
You see the real reason
we do it is for you guys!

443
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,416
This glorious movie also marks
Miss Panty's on screen debut,

444
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,333
isn't that right, darling?

445
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,750
Yes, that is correct!

446
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,916
I've never done a film or
sex tape before this one.

447
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,166
Fantastic.

448
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,333
Well then it comes as
no surprise that this is

449
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,333
Miss Stocking's
first movie as well.

450
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,583
Thank you!

451
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,083
Doing this film with my
sister as been amazing!

452
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,541
Actually, funny story; Stockin'
started out as my co-star.

453
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,125
Charity and what not.

454
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,583
But then we realized she didn't
fit the theme we were going for.

455
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,750
You know, we wanted
bright and shiny glamour,

456
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,583
yet all she brought
was dark and moody goth.

457
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,916
So I did everyone a little favor
and made myself the only star!

458
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,625
I knew you guys would
prefer it that way,

459
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,875
and since you all
mean so much to me,

460
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,958
I made sure you got
what you wanted!

461
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:12,458
And mad props should be
given to our talented CG staff

462
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,666
who took the time
to go back and delete

463
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,333
every scene Stockin' was in.

464
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,500
Now you don't have to
gag while watching her face!

465
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:21,041
That's just the first fantastic
thing about this movie!

466
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,083
You guys are
going to love it!

467
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:33,625
I love it here!

468
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,666
Who wants body shots?

469
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,708
The name's Panty, boys.

470
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,166
No cock-carrying specimen
is immune to my sexy powers.

471
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,458
Watch yourself!

472
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,333
Panty? For real?
