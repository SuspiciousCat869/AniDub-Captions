1
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,250
"Excretion Without
Honor and Humanity."

2
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,541
Daten City, a town clinging
to the threshold between

3
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,250
Heaven and Hell, where the
peace of its human inhabitants

4
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,041
is regularly threatened by
foul tempered, evil spirits.

5
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,083
A fetid darkness lodged in
the cracks of troubled souls

6
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,666
will obstruct this
town today, unnoticed.

7
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,375
Silent.

8
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,916
Deadly.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,333
However, there are some who
wield a light beyond all

10
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,458
human understanding and ascend
their stools of righteousness

11
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,833
to eradicate those shadows
bound by the bowels of hell.

12
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,291
But who could have
been given the duty

13
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,958
of eliminating this darkness?

14
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,166
Are they servants of God
or minions of the devil?

15
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,000
Shit! What the hell is goin' on?

16
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,291
Having a good morning, Panty?

17
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,166
That's your cue
to go, sweet cheeks.

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,208
So, I'll call you, and--yeah?

19
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,666
And how you feelin'
this morning, Stocking?

20
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,000
Fuck off.

21
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,708
Don't talk to me until
I've had my goddamn sugar.

22
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,750
Heaven has blessed
us with a clue that

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
should lead us to
another ghost to take out!

24
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,458
Listen up!

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
Water closet!

26
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,375
That means bathroom.

27
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,083
We have reports of
people being suddenly

28
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,250
and inexplicably
sucked into their toilets,

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,375
almost as if the commodes
are eating them alive.

30
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,333
Taking a massive dump is one of
the most vulnerable positions

31
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,250
a person can find themselves in.

32
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,333
For someone or something
to prey upon that weakness

33
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,375
is a vicious and damnable act!

34
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,416
Woe, this be
the work of a ghost.

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,916
All I need out of life
is to wake up

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,166
next to some morning wood.

37
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,375
Is there anything hard
you refuse to jump on?

38
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,208
Oh, stop it with the
self-righteous bullshit.

39
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,375
Everyone's got a hobby.

40
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,958
Yeah, that's true.
I'll stick with sugar.

41
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,458
Don't you ever crave protein?

42
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,375
Don't you ever not?

43
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,458
Hey, it's good for you!

44
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,625
Ain't that right, Garter?

45
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,000
Shut up!

46
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,458
First of all,

47
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,958
why the fuck do you think
I know the answer to that?

48
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,000
And secondly, if you don't
want to be stuck here forever,

49
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,166
the only option you
pathetic excuses for anything

50
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,250
resembling angels have is to
buy your way back into heaven

51
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,333
with Heaven Coins you collect
exterminating evil ghosts!

52
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,916
Contrary to popular belief,

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,166
you are not here to
collect men or sugar!

54
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,583
So focus and stop
acting like fat ass hoes!

55
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,416
So what're you thinking?

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,125
Eh, fuck it; let's go.

57
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,416
Hey, Stockin'?

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
What is it, Panty?

59
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,458
You ready to roll?

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,666
Yeah!

61
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,583
I love how See Through
always gets us

62
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,083
wherever we need to go with
some mother fuckin' style!

63
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,291
Get it, girl!

64
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,375
Get it!

65
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:11,791
Yes!

66
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,083
It's never flowed better.

67
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh God.

68
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,958
You are a master at your craft.

69
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,583
Uh, yeah, thanks.

70
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,500
I'll stop by later
and check up on it.

71
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,625
My, aren't you just
the sweetest darn thing?

72
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,125
But I think you need
to stay a bit longer

73
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,041
cause I've got something
else you can check up on.

74
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,666
Bingo!

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,500
Found him!

76
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,333
A toilet and a plumber dude?

77
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,208
Yeah, that's him.

78
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,291
Are you sure?

79
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,833
That's the fucker
we're looking for.

80
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,208
Isn't that right asshole?

81
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,208
Tell me, do you
feel lucky punk?

82
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,041
Well, do ya?

83
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:37,750
Do ya?

84
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,083
That might not be him.

85
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't think it's him.

86
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,041
Color me shocked.

87
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,291
Please stop hitting me.

88
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,291
It really hurts.

89
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,958
I haven't done anything!

90
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,875
Fuck, you're a hot piece of ass.

91
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,000
You are preaching
to the vag, sister.

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,458
Hang on to these for me.

93
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,541
Gross.

94
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,375
Well, he's feeling lucky now.

95
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,708
But he was just a plumber.

96
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,666
So true.

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,375
And my pipes are totally clean.

98
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,125
How long have you been
waiting to use that joke?

99
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,291
Fuck, it seems like forever.

100
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,541
I couldn't not,
ya know what I mean?

101
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,583
What are you saying?

102
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,083
I don't mind
fucking for a laugh.

103
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,250
Your acting like you
don't even give a shit!

104
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,708
Oh Lord, grant me the patience!

105
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's just fuckin' eat.

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,458
Shit was that good!

107
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,250
Your curry is unreal, Garter!

108
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,833
That's cuz it's black, baby.

109
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,541
You won't ever go back.

110
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,916
So what's up for dessert?

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,625
I'm guessing chocolate
for no reason in particular.

112
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,333
Well, I don't give a shit.

113
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,375
So, I'm gonna go take one.

114
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,083
I'll be in the can
if you need me.

115
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,333
Don't let the toilet eat you!

116
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,125
Oh, screw off!

117
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,708
We should have picked
up some chocolate bombs

118
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,250
from the Meadow Muffin Bakery!

119
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,000
Those plops of gooey
dough just never get old!

120
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,625
Does she even hear
what she's saying?

121
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,958
I just want tasty brown goodness
in my mouth all the time.

122
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,291
Is that too much to ask?

123
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,625
Oh, God!

124
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,291
My mouth is watering
just thinking about it!

125
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,291
Fuck!

126
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,208
Shit!

127
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,500
Stockin'!

128
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,666
Stockin'!

129
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,375
Help me!
Goddamnit, Stocking!

130
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,875
Shut up, Panty!

131
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,291
No one wants to talk to you
while you're taking a dump!

132
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,583
That's so disgusting!

133
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,250
I hope you shit your
face off while you're

134
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,125
shitting your guts out if
that makes you feel any better.

135
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,375
Okay.

136
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,291
I get it now.

137
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,541
Okay, you get what now?

138
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,083
Maybe the what's curry.

139
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,208
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,458
I get it.

141
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,083
Well we don't get it.

142
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,958
What the hell is that thing?

143
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,708
It looks like a huge ass
scoop of chocolate ice cream.

144
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,625
Hey, I want some!
Yummy!

145
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,291
Freeze, shithead!

146
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,833
Don't make any
sudden movements!

147
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,541
Shit fart doodoo!

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Holy shit!

149
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,041
What the fuck are we gonna do?

150
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,500
Oh.

151
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,583
No offense, Preacher Man,
but Jesus God--what is that?

152
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,041
Unfortunately, you be staring

153
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,291
into the brown eye
of an evil spirit.

154
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,000
The negative energy created
by all the plumbers who've

155
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,625
suffocated and died from the
stench of clogged-ass toilets

156
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,125
has manifested
himself into a vengeful spirit.

157
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,500
This powerful ghost utilized
all the fecal matter in the city

158
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,916
to achieve his poodie-poop
physical form!

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,833
That's disgusting!

160
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,833
Oh, God!
He's gonna spew!

161
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,375
I don't think I can handle
any more bodily functions.

162
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,208
Suck it up, dude!

163
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,333
Not literally though.

164
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,541
Oh, shit, I'm gonna hurl again.

165
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,958
Please don't tell me
prayer is the only thing

166
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,458
that can get us out of this.

167
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,833
Why the heck would
I tell you that?

168
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,708
God ain't even here right now.

169
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,041
Prayer can go to hell, man.

170
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,083
We got angels!

171
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,541
Panty and Stocking, you're up!

172
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,041
What?

173
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,625
Are you talking about that
walking turdsicle over there?

174
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:54,166
And that goth chick next to it,
who obviously has daddy issues?

175
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,166
It's time for us
to flush the toilet.

176
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
Number one, that was cheesy;
number two, you smell like shit.

177
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,666
How about I buy you a cake
from that fancy bakery and

178
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,291
you manage to do this without
saying another fucking word?

179
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,541
As long as what I'm saying
now doesn't count, I'm in.

180
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,541
Then let's make this fucking
fucker pay for covering me

181
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,500
in this fucking shit;
okay you can reply to that.

182
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
Let's rock.

183
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,833
O, pitiful shadow
lost in the darkness.

184
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,291
O evil spirit born of those

185
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,250
drifting between
Heaven and Earth.

186
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,000
May the thunderous power from
the garments of these holy,

187
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,916
delicate maidens strike down
upon you with great vengeance

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,791
and furious anger, shattering
your loathsome impurity

189
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,125
and returning you
from whence you came.

190
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,583
Repent, you motherfucker!

191
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
This blows!

192
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,625
Good Angels.

193
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:41,708
You got a coin.

194
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,791
All that for just one?

195
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, one closer,
so quit your bitching.

196
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,750
"The evil has been vanquished!"
So rings the bell.

197
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,458
At least I'm assuming
that's why it's ringing.

198
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,750
Now, keep your promise
and go buy me that cake.

199
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,916
I need sweet stat.

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,250
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,541
Look, I found a tasty
little treat for me, too!

202
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,708
Whatever you say, ma'am.

203
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,750
You're an angel!

204
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,083
You still have a
punishment to face.

205
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,708
Oh, like what?
Bondage?

206
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,250
What would I get out of that?

207
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,333
Uh, yeah; I've got plans, so you
can leave me the hell alone.

208
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,416
Shit!

209
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,250
Death Race 2010!

210
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,291
Come on, are you
fucking kidding me?

211
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,625
Faster does not mean
better, you asshole.

212
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,625
Dude. You're one
hard-core angel.

213
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,250
You get my motor running.

214
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,250
How is this fair?

215
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,625
Look how many
times you've cum!

216
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,625
I've only squirted once
and it wasn't that far.

217
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,750
You know what, babe?

218
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,333
You're more like a
devil than an angel.

219
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,666
Real fucking profound.

220
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,791
You're too old to rock
leather pants, by the way.

221
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,875
Seriously.

222
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,916
You look like
Mick Jagger's grandpa.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,708
Whoa, what's going on here?

224
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,666
This is an incredible
turn of events!

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,833
If you're just joining us, an
unmanned sports car is somehow

226
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,250
running wild--

227
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,625
That thing looks like it
might even be faster than you!

228
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,541
No way! Nothing can outrace
my ride! Wait. What?

229
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,291
Hey, is that Stockin'?

230
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,750
The police are
currently redirecting traffic--

231
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,375
This is Panty.

232
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,708
Where are you at?

233
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,958
I am, uh, visiting the
elderly at a nursing home.

234
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,291
Don't lie to me!
You're at that immoral hotel!

235
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,875
Shit! Whoops.
I got another call!

236
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,791
Panty! Are you watching TV?

237
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,041
Nope. So what's up?

238
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
You diddling
another douche bag?

239
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,291
Get your skank ass
out here and help me!

240
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,125
Fine. I'll go.
Jesus, calm down!

241
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,625
It's not like this guy is
rocking my world or anything.

242
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,333
I wasn't kidding.

243
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,250
My bike is wicked fast.

244
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,916
Yeah, guess what, fuckface.

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,708
A little technique doesn't hurt.

246
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,375
Oh thanks for the ride.

247
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,208
Get outta the way, losers!

248
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,750
That means I'm gonna
run your asses over!

249
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,416
And no one can stop me!

250
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
He's run over
everyone in his path,

251
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,000
spilling the blood of
numerous innocent victims!

252
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
It's an alarming
case of road rage!

253
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,666
Come on!

254
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,375
Aw, are you trying
to catch me, kitty cat?

255
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,208
 Well, bring it on, bitch!

256
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,791
But, to be honest,

257
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,708
I don't think you're gonna be
able to handle what I'm packing!

258
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,666
That means I have a big dick!

259
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,041
Nice!

260
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
These boots are fantastic!

261
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
Hah. Bingo!

262
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Now, one of your
salespersons talked me

263
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,416
into buying this
atrocity yesterday.

264
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,875
They had me convinced
it looked good,

265
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,000
but I resembled a sideshow
circus freak in it. I would

266
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,333
like to return this horrible
outfit for a full refund,

267
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,916
and I want an apology!

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,750
Yes!

269
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,375
Not even close!

270
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,375
Hey, what's up, shit pickle?

271
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,458
So where are you off to
in such a fucking hurry?

272
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,000
Who the hell cares where I'm
off to, as long as I get off!

273
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, yeah, good one.

274
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,916
That means
ejaculate, specifically!

275
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,166
Yeah, I got that.

276
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,583
Trust me, queef breath,

277
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,291
if there's anything I
understand, it's the big 'O'.

278
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
It's about time.

279
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,875
Did you mount everything
on your way over?

280
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,291
You two know each other?

281
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,708
I did not.

282
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,000
But I'll be sure to make
that happen for you next time.

283
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,458
Get a load of this.

284
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,708
Take it all!

285
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,291
I bet you like it
rough, don't you?

286
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,583
Oh, yeah!

287
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,791
That's what you
get for being late!

288
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:09,500
Shit!

289
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,625
Where did Backlace go?

290
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,208
What's on my face?

291
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,333
Hey, who turned
out the lights?

292
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,666
My gun is on your face!

293
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,333
Well, technically,
it's my panties.

294
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,833
Shit! On the bright side,

295
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,708
it does smell like
I'm going really fast!

296
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,416
Stop licking that right now!

297
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,708
Bet you've never
said that before.

298
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,583
Move over!

299
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,500
Go, See Through! Go!

300
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,875
It looks as though the Anarchy
Sisters, Panty and Stocking

301
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,791
have finally joined forces
and are determined

302
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,875
to catch this unruly roadster!

303
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,000
Wait, we may not need our
angelic assassins, after all!

304
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,416
A convoy of police
cars is closing in on

305
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,083
the creepy coupe from behind!

306
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,041
What the hell?

307
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,958
You're totally stealing
our job, ya thiefs!

308
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,375
Take this!

309
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,666
And this!

310
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,875
That means suck it, coppers!

311
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,083
Opa!

312
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,375
Are you trying to
create a barricade?

313
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,166
Against me?

314
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,166
You idiots!

315
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,416
Who the hell do
you think you are?

316
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,958
The Spartan army?

317
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,958
I'm gonna gladiate the fuck
outta you donut-eating dipshits!

318
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm outta here!

319
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,916
Ah, life in the fast lane.
Just makes you finish quicker.

320
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,166
That means you're dead.

321
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,541
Wait!

322
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,500
Chill the fuck out;
I gotta get my panties first!

323
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,625
Later suckers.

324
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:58,083
Jump here and I am in!

325
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,250
That's not good.

326
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,625
Now you do realize
this is all your fault?

327
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,125
I'm aware, thanks.

328
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,625
That doesn't mean you can
destroy my panties though, okay?

329
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,208
Not being made of
fiberglass is awesome!

330
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,875
It's time for payback,
you scumbag pigs.

331
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,458
Which I'm saying
'cause you're all cops!

332
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,625
Hey, fat ass!

333
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,958
I have an idea!

334
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,958
Why don't you let me help
you lighten your load?

335
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,541
Are we rolling?

336
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,791
You got nothing!

337
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,750
Shit, except that!

338
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,833
Goddamnit!

339
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,625
Stop, that hurts!

340
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,750
That means ow!

341
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,458
Mother fucking ow!

342
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,208
Sonofabitch you're brutal!

343
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,083
Ugh gross.

344
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,875
Gunpowder smells
like old hag stank.

345
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,083
What's wrong?

346
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,208
Hey dick angel, are
you giving up already?

347
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:07,916
No way.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,333
Is this a challenge?

349
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,583
What, are you playin'
chicken with the rooster, bitch?

350
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,916
I give you credit though.

351
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,208
You've got some massive balls!

352
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,333
Shove it up your exhaust pipe.

353
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,708
That means ass!

354
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,875
Let go of me!

355
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,708
It's not my fault
you look like Hitler!

356
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,833
Shut up!

357
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,750
That's the last time
you sneak in here

358
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,375
on my watch, you punk kid!

359
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:49,875
Yeah!

360
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,958
Fuckin A!

361
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,041
Rad.

362
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,666
Let's collect the coins
and get out of here.

363
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,625
Did you ruin my panties?

364
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,833
They were expensive as hell!

365
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,916
You owe me a new
pair if you did!

366
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,583
Hey, we killed
the damn ghost.

367
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,708
The bell should be ringing.

368
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,750
That's how it works.

369
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,041
Yeah, that's weird.

370
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,250
I'm not dead yet.

371
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,916
Not even close!

372
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,208
Round three?
Seriously?

373
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,416
Now we're talking.

374
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,750
I can keep going
all night, buddy.

375
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,208
Ask around.

376
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:17,916
It's true.

377
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,041
She's a giant slut.

378
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,666
All I need is to get
a hold of Backlace

379
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,625
so I can finish
him off for good!

380
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,125
Hey!

381
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,375
Get me up to him, and I'll
give you a flash of my panties!

382
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:25,916
What?

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,958
Your panties?

384
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,166
Fucking go!

385
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,791
We can't air this!

386
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,000
Can we?

387
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,583
We're airing this if
I have to blow someone!

388
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,041
Do what she said!

389
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,416
Let's get him, See Through!

390
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,875
That's what I'm talking about!

391
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,791
Now!

392
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,083
Oh, fuck, yes!

393
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,333
I'm almost there!

394
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,583
I'm so close!

395
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,291
Yes!

396
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,208
I'm gonna blow.

397
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,458
Oh God, don't stop!

398
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm about to explode!

399
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:56,791
Yeah!

400
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,458
Climax to the max!

401
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,375
This is it!

402
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,708
Oh, yeah!

403
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,208
This speed is amazing!

404
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,916
I haven't even used protection!

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,166
No brakes!

406
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,291
Pedal to the metal
the whole time!

407
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,375
Yeah, baby!

408
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,708
That means I never--Let--Up!

409
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,291
He's so disgusting.

410
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,875
Oh yeah!

411
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,041
Chuck.

412
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,708
You know, I just now
realized something.

413
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,000
With men, it's not
about quantity or speed.

414
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,208
It's about how
stretchy they are!

415
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,541
Ready?

416
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,541
Where you goin'?

417
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,166
Don't you worry.

418
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm coming back!

419
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh ouch!

420
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, I'm done here?

421
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,000
It's not me; it's you.

422
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,625
Repent, motherfucker!

423
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,208
Shit!

424
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,666
Is this my stop?

425
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,708
How many are there?

426
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,750
Three Heavens!

427
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,208
Cheap and disappointing.

428
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,458
Really?

429
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:34,458
Because you seemed to
be enjoying yourself.

430
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,250
Meh.

431
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,541
Everyone likes to go fast,

432
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,416
but without good technique,
what's the point?

433
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,625
Gross.

434
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,125
I'm so never
wearing these again.

435
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,458
Is the gospel told
by these angels filled

436
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,958
with the light of hope
or the darkness of despair?

437
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,125
The people live their lives
unaware here in the city located

438
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,500
somewhere between
Heaven and Earth.
