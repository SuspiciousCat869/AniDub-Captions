1
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,125
"Raiders of the Nasal Dark."

2
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,916
Daten City, a veritable
vortex of necessary waste.

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,791
A place where people
are always digging

4
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:19,000
for the newest,
tastiest nugget of gold.

5
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,083
But trends, like bodily
functions, happen.

6
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,625
What's passionately
picked one day is destined

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,666
to be flicked to
the side the next.

8
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,083
Small chance of
rain today, folks,

9
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,666
so watch out for that
high pollen count.

10
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,500
Tell me you're not
picking your nose in public.

11
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,958
It's called Oscar
Picker Therapy,

12
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,541
and it's officially a thing;
here, check it out.

13
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,083
Fuck yeah, mucous membranes!

14
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,458
Get fingered!

15
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,333
Look, sugar tits,
everyone is doing it.

16
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,250
Nothing personal,
but you're an ass.

17
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,458
Could you stop?

18
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,541
I'm trying to eat.

19
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,625
That shit looks
like what I'm picking.

20
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:44,666
Who's an ass now?

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,000
You should try some,
ya nose whore.

22
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,333
They just put it on the menu.

23
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,666
It's gooey goodness that

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,791
still has enough crunch to
get stuck in your teeth.

25
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,791
It's awesome.

26
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,166
It's made from
this extra-thick,

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,791
one hundred eight
percent egg cream.

28
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,208
It's a goddamned
sweet revolution!

29
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,375
Sticky little nougat,
I love you so!

30
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,458
See, they look exactly the same!

31
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,041
That's sick!

32
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,500
I think you need some water; all
that picking has dehydrated you.

33
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,333
Probly.

34
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,458
Weird.

35
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,791
It's filled with a
crazy amount of gas.

36
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,750
Christ balls what are
you doing here, Geek Boy?

37
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,083
Nobody invited your lame face.

38
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,250
Oh, sorry.

39
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,708
It's kinda setting
off my ghost detector!

40
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,291
Really?

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,166
'Cuz you're setting off my "get
the fuck away from me" detector.

42
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,041
Well, God fucking
bless that guy, shit.

43
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,291
Oh, ladies, ladies, hello!

44
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,875
Where have you
been all my life?

45
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,666
Tell me, my lovely customers,
how are my sweets treating you?

46
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,333
Sorry babies,
I didn't mean to be rude.

47
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,125
I own this sexy café.

48
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,916
My name is Oscar H. Genius.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,333
And what, may I ask,
should I call you two beauties?

50
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,083
Panty!

51
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,250
Stocking!

52
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,625
Erotic monikers;
that is so my style!

53
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,208
Now, you sensual little
minxes, how would you like

54
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,958
to join me for a celebratory
party on my airship?

55
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,000
We're gonna have cake!

56
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
Believe it or not babies,

57
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,708
it's the Oscar Group's one
hundred and eighth anniversary!

58
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,750
That's cool.

59
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,916
Um, let's talk about
what kinda cake?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,875
Trust me, babies,
you will love it!

61
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,125
All these people are here
just to go to my shin dig

62
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,041
and you two are by far
the hottest tootsies,

63
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,375
so you have to go.

64
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,000
C'mon we're having a
smorgasbord of sweet treats

65
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,583
as part of the orgy of fun.

66
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,000
Smorgasbord of sweets!

67
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,250
Smorgasbord of orgy!

68
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,416
Oh shit, that
mofo is flying away.

69
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,375
We're too late.

70
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,500
Don't worry, babies.

71
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,750
It's cool.

72
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,291
The goober gases will
get us there no problem.

73
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,125
See what I mean?

74
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,625
Everybody's doing it, babies!

75
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,375
It's show time!

76
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,500
Calling all my babies!

77
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,750
Welcome to the Oscar Party!

78
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,208
So sweet!

79
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,041
My mouth is so
fucking happy right now!

80
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,458
Yeah, well, my lips got nothin'.

81
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,125
If your snatch ass
doesn't hurry up

82
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,791
and snatch some,
they'll all be gone.

83
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,625
I can't eat and pick
at the same damn time.

84
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,416
So, I'm just gonna
stick with picking.

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,166
That's funny;
I can't not do both!

86
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,375
Hello, Miss Panty.

87
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,416
So glad you made it, babe.

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,125
Care to join me in VIP?

89
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
 Fuck yeah I do!

90
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,125
Later, Stockin'!

91
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,875
See?

92
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,000
I told you this
would be amazing.

93
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,000
It is.

94
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,666
Oh my God, faster!

95
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,791
Go faster!

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,875
You like that hot stuff?

97
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,500
You're driving me crazy.

98
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,041
I've got something
special for you.

99
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,416
I call it the Pleasure Twister.

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,250
Oh my God!

101
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,958
Yes! Don't stop!

102
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,791
Yeah, that's the spot isn't it?

103
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,208
You're tighter than
I thought you'd be!

104
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,875
Why does everyone
always say that?

105
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,000
That was a-fucking-mazing.

106
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,041
I had no idea my hole
exploration was so limited.

107
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,500
And I do not say that lightly.

108
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,958
Well it's new.

109
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,166
I'm on the cutting edge of
everything, especially sex.

110
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,708
Sticking one's boogers into
another's nose is--Fuck.

111
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,583
Fuck.

112
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,833
Fuckchoo! Fuckchoo!

113
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,458
Curses! There's only
one kind of booger

114
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,916
that can make me
Fuckchoo like that!

115
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,625
You little devil!

116
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,458
You're an angel!

117
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,875
I can't stop!

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,833
What's happening?

119
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,416
Feels so good!

120
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,333
Oh my God!

121
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,958
I can't stop picking!

122
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,416
Stocking's getting upset!

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,708
Fuckchoo! Fuckchoo!
Look what your disgusting

124
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,916
boogers have done to my mucus!

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,958
My crispy critters
are turning to snot!

126
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,416
Fuck.

127
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,666
You're actually a ghost?

128
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,041
I can't believe
I let you finger me.

129
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,333
Well, looks like
my secret is out.

130
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,541
But you're too
late to stop me now!

131
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,625
Oscar H. Genius is actually
a snot burgling ghost!

132
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,625
We've figured that out.

133
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,833
Where the fuck
did you come from?

134
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,458
Your momma's ass; now
can we please focus

135
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,416
on that giant booger
eating ghost outside?

136
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,416
Check out that read!

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,958
Is he the ghost of
someone who died

138
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,291
from eating too
many nose goblins?

139
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,958
Nah, he's just a guy
who slipped on some snot

140
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:00,833
and broke his neck.

141
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,750
Like it matters, ya big dildos.

142
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,625
Watch out for the
dust he just released;

143
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,583
once a person inhales it, they
won't be able to resist the urge

144
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,250
to pick their nose, causing all
the moisture in their bodies

145
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,916
to be converted
into nasal waste!

146
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,500
I must have snorted the
dust out of habit!

147
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,583
Damn it, it's too late for me!

148
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,333
Save yourself!

149
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,333
This ghost sucks balls!

150
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,958
Oh no, the ghost's
nose is bleeding, too!

151
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,500
The force of the gas
on top of the rush

152
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,333
of nosebleeds will
turn us into a snot rocket

153
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,208
heading straight
towards the moon!

154
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,916
I just burst my own nose hymen!

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,708
What?

156
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,666
This is bad!

157
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,958
We all going to die!

158
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,625
Must. Stop. Picking.

159
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,208
The ghost was planning
on using nosebleeds

160
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,500
to propel us forward
the whole time!

161
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,833
And that means--

162
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,666
If we all pop our nose
cherries at the same time,

163
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,000
we won't be able to stop!

164
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,166
Move it snot wagons!

165
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,625
I gotta get away from myself!

166
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,291
No way!

167
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,375
Stop right there!

168
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,666
Hold it in!

169
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,458
We're nearly out
of the atmosphere!

170
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,958
At this rate, I don't see how
we won't crash into the moon.

171
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,458
We're all gonna die!

172
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,375
Wait, what about angel boogers?

173
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,875
Hey, that's it!

174
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,875
He was allergic
to Panty's mucous!

175
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,666
We just need to get
some inside his nose

176
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,250
and make him sneeze
before we crash!

177
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,875
I did it, you guys!
I found the only way out!

178
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,083
That was my idea!

179
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,000
Get back to picking!

180
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,208
We need your boogers!

181
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,458
There's nothing left.
It's all nosebleed!

182
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,416
We don't know if mine work!

183
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,541
Stop it!

184
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,583
Well I don't want
any more of my holes

185
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,500
to get unnecessarily
stretched out!

186
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,583
Oh drop the act,
you nose whore!

187
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,750
Jesus.

188
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,833
Here.

189
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,083
Um, you can, uh,
use this if you'd like.

190
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,583
Well, that's gross.

191
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,750
Are you kidding me?

192
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,125
You actually collected
all of my boogers?

193
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,375
Is that weird?

194
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,375
Not if you're a twisted
piece of shit stalker!

195
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,250
And you wonder why
everyone hates you!

196
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,791
Okay, Stockin', watch my back!

197
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,791
I'm heading straight for
that fucker's nostrils!

198
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,166
Be right there, Panty!

199
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,125
I'm gonna make sure the
passengers are freed first!

200
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,041
Time to kick some snout!

201
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,958
So apparently the cabin
isn't part of the ghost.

202
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,250
Look up! Look up!

203
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,083
This ghost is a bitch.

204
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,958
This ghost is so a bitch!

205
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,791
Fucking shit.

206
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,208
I forgot I'm wearing shorts.

207
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,708
Damnit, I can't get this
belt off with just one hand!

208
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,500
Stockin'!

209
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,166
I'm on it!

210
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,791
Your cooch just
made us go faster!

211
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,875
So I gotta hot hot-pocket.

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,166
Well, that worked
for us well enough,

213
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,500
but I hope they'll be okay.

214
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,416
Your snot rocket to the
moon is landing early!

215
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,708
Fuck!

216
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,666
Why do you always have
to milk the foreplay?

217
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,416
Here, hold that for me, will ya?

218
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,666
That's better. Thanks!

219
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,833
Ohmigahd, gross!

220
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,958
Your crusty sinus
juice touched my face!

221
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,125
Shut up and take the right.

222
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,666
I'll take the left.

223
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,958
Ew, it's stuck to my sword!

224
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,791
Your boogie is not cooperating!

225
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,458
I'm gonna find your
spot now, snothead!

226
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,666
Yeah, I'm coming!

227
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
No, Panty!

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,416
Oh!

229
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,416
No!

230
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,125
Fuck. Fuck.

231
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,625
Fuck.

232
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,333
Fuckchoo!

233
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,291
God bless me.

234
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,500
It's out!

235
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,208
If it's good, you might as
well stick with it, am I right?

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
"Vomiting Point."

237
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,458
Daten City, synonymous
with extremes:

238
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:00,291
love, hate, decadence and,
uh, the opposite of decadence.

239
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,083
To the west of
this mixed up town

240
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,333
is a mixed up little area
called Little Tokyo.

241
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,416
In this ghetto, shit place,
ghetto, shit people seek,

242
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
ghetto, shit happiness.

243
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,500
As they live out their
ghetto, shit lives.

244
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,166
Now Lord, may you shower--

245
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,875
--your ghetto,
shit fortune upon 'em!

246
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,500
Nightmare.

247
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:35,791
This weather
is so gross.

248
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,875
But I'm not.

249
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,000
Terao, I didn't want
to bring this up again.

250
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,083
To be honest, I never
want to bring it up.

251
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,166
You know that.

252
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,750
Okay, you didn't
meet your quota again.

253
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,000
You only locked down two
contracts this month.

254
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,750
I know, I'm sorry.

255
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,375
Omori is doing better than you.

256
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,125
And that guy is easily the
stupidest person I've ever met.

257
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,958
Sorry, sir.

258
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,333
Yeah.

259
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,208
You're always sorry, but
apologizing isn't your job.

260
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,416
Sorry.

261
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,750
Have you thought
about retiring, maybe?

262
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,583
It's just the same
discussion every month,

263
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,500
and I know it's hard for you,
but imagine my position.

264
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,583
This isn't fair to
either one of us.

265
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,625
Chief Nishi,
call on line 3.

266
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
Excuse me a sec.

267
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,541
Yes? This is Nishi speaking.

268
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,541
Oh!

269
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,708
Yes, sir, I remember her.

270
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,291
She's the blond one with
the big ass titties, right?

271
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,250
Yeah.

272
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,625
Yeah, the bouncy ones.

273
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,166
Oh, I don't know.

274
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,875
I spent my stripper budget for
the whole month that night.

275
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,708
I don't know what
I was thinking.

276
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,750
No, sir; I couldn't let you pay.

277
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,125
You're right,
yes I can. I'm in.

278
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:57,166
Definitely.

279
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:06,625
Definitely.

280
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,875
Man, d'you hear
Terao gettin' it earlier?

281
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,125
Yeah, it was harsh.

282
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,375
That dude is old;
I feel bad for him.

283
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,541
Don't; he was only hired
because he knew someone in HR.

284
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,333
Sexually?

285
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,375
God, no.

286
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,375
Jesus.

287
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,375
Idiot.

288
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,291
It was his father,
ya sick pervert.

289
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,916
Terao's old man was the
captain of our CEO's unit

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,625
during the war
or some bullshit.

291
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,500
Oh, I get it.

292
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,041
That's why they won't fire him.

293
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,583
And he's a shittier closer than
even me, am I right, Sugita?

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,833
It's kinda sad if you
think about it, though.

295
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,833
I mean, he's over fifty
and still just a peon.

296
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,791
Can you imagine living
your whole life like that?

297
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,041
Blech.

298
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,583
Oh, shit, you guys.

299
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,166
Terao, how long have
you been standing there?

300
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,708
I'm just gonna go now.

301
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,541
Terao, wait!

302
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,625
Be sure to get that thing we
talked about for tomorrow.

303
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,291
Okay.

304
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,208
You guys are a couple of grade
A dipshits, you know that?

305
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,250
What? We didn't know he
was standing right there!

306
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,833
He scared the Christ out of me.

307
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,041
He's like a ninja.

308
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah, right.

309
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,541
When I see Terao, I think,
"there goes a ninja."

310
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,083
Next stop.

311
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,083
Last station.

312
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,625
Would you put your paper away?

313
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,625
We're trying to have
a nice dinner,

314
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,125
it'd be great if you'd join us.

315
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,041
Sorry.

316
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,416
Hey, Daddy!

317
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,125
Did you know that tomorrow's
going to be my birthday?

318
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,250
Yes, I know.

319
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,333
It's the wonderful
day you were born.

320
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,125
Will you get me a meeting
for them for my present?

321
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,166
Meeting who?

322
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,791
I don't know what
you're talking about.

323
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,916
Daddy!

324
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,666
Panty and Stocking.

325
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,625
Who? Panty and--?

326
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,583
Repent, mother fuckers!

327
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,958
Suck on this, asshole!

328
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,750
Fuck!

329
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,958
Those are not sweet words,

330
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,041
and we do not use them
at the dinner table.

331
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,791
Sorry.

332
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,125
Oh, Mother!

333
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,583
Why don't you just ask for help!

334
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,333
You spilt that all
over the place.

335
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,000
See, you upset your
Grandmother with that language.

336
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,125
But Mama, Daddy asked.

337
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,375
Mother!

338
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,666
Will you knock it off
with the sauce already?

339
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,041
And now it's time for
the Midnight News Show!

340
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,500
Who's this city's
favorite duo again?

341
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,666
Panty and Stocking.

342
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,083
Oscar H. Genius,

343
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:32,541
the pharmaceutical company
CEO and snappy dresser...

344
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,750
Oh, I see.

345
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,541
They're super heroes, huh?

346
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,625
Come on, Mika, what's wrong?

347
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,500
Whoa.

348
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,166
What the hell is this thing?

349
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,333
Look at that shit.

350
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,500
Please tell me that's
not supposed to be

351
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,250
what we got Mika
for her birthday.

352
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,833
Yeah, Terao bought it!

353
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,291
God fuckin' knows why he'd think
she'd like something like that.

354
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,875
What are you guys talking about?

355
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,958
Guess what?

356
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,541
My birthday cake is
the bestest cake ever!

357
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,208
That's nice, honey, and
daddy will have your present

358
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,666
for you when he gets
home later tonight, okay?

359
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,958
Really?

360
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,375
Thank you, Daddy!
I love you!

361
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,458
Wow, this is kind of depressing.

362
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,750
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,416
I don't know why I'm crying.

364
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,125
It's okay.

365
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,375
I am just a temp anyway.

366
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,416
What's going on?

367
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,958
What's the matter, Mika?

368
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,291
This is all my fault.

369
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,125
I told Terao that she
liked antiques and stuff.

370
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,541
I should've been more specific;

371
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,916
I had a feeling he'd find
a way to screw us over.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,791
Man!

373
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,791
Yeah, this gift is total shit.

374
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,833
Oh no.

375
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,375
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

376
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,708
I think I might've gotten my
wires mixed up again, somehow.

377
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,041
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,041
Please forgive me, Mika.

379
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,666
No, it's cool.

380
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,958
It's my fault.

381
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,166
I never should have asked
you to get something

382
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
for someone so difficult!

383
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,500
I have an idea.

384
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,958
Why don't we all just
go out for a drink!

385
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,458
Yeah, our treat.

386
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,250
How about it?

387
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,041
That should cheer you up.

388
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:08,708
Yeah!

389
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
You wanna?

390
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,083
Hey!

391
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,166
Terao.

392
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,791
What's that drink
you call a drink?

393
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,125
Oh, it's nothing, it's just I'm
not a big drinker, you know?

394
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,958
Well, shit, look at yourself;

395
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,708
you need to develop
a habit, pronto!

396
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,208
Yes, thank you.

397
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,291
I, uh, have somewhere to be,
so I should be going.

398
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:36,958
What?

399
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,791
You're going?

400
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,666
The hell you are!

401
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,791
Sit down.

402
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,916
Hey, you!

403
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,875
That could've hit--!

404
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,083
Oh, my goodness.

405
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,625
You're the one who made
Mika cry, remember?

406
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,958
You think you can just walk
out of here, huh, willy nilly?

407
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:52,541
You're drunk.

408
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,250
No!

409
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,208
Fuck that, old man!

410
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,333
You're shooting from the tower!

411
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,083
Sir.

412
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,583
Really, I'm not a drinker.

413
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,791
You don't drink, don't gamble,
don't cheat on your wife!

414
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,916
What the hell?

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,958
What do you do?

416
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,958
It's my daughter's birthday.

417
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,208
You know whats your problem is?

418
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,875
You don't make
your career seriously!

419
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,333
You're the worst employee

420
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,791
in this whole company
and in this whole bar!

421
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,333
I can't even squint
achyou right now, man!

422
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,583
You disgust me!

423
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,375
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll get to drinking right away.

424
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,750
--Wow!
--Wow!

425
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,125
Nice.

426
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,916
Incredible!

427
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Thank you.

428
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,208
I'll just be off now.

429
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,083
Terao, are you alright?

430
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,583
Happy Birthday, honey!

431
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,291
Congratulations, Chi!

432
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,791
Oh! Do you like it?

433
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,791
Happy birthday...

434
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,583
Oh wow! It's so pretty!

435
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,125
Where'd the lights go?

436
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,625
Happy Birthday, baby.

437
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,375
Way to go!

438
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,375
Terao!

439
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:20,958
Oh good!

440
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:21,666
Hey!

441
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,833
Welcome back, my man!

442
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,666
Can you hear us?

443
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,541
Yes?

444
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,791
Oh, thank God.

445
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,166
You old bastard, you had
us scared half to death!

446
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,583
Come on; wake back up.

447
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,791
Daddy might not make it.

448
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,541
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,333
So sorry.

450
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,083
Are you fucking kidding
me with this shit?

451
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,666
I just bought this outfit,
and now it's covered in puke!

452
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,416
You ever heard of a
little thing called karma?

453
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,750
Fuck karma, man!

454
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,625
And fuck that barfing
hurl bag piece of shit.

455
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,250
Fuck him right in his lady ass!

456
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,375
Oh, Jesus, please don't!

457
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,375
Ew, gross! Can you imagine?

458
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,000
Um. Excuse me...

459
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,166
Uhm... Hello?

460
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,708
Yeah?

461
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,708
Um.

462
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,333
Yes, it's just.

463
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,583
It's my daughter's birthday,
she's a big fan.

464
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,083
So, I--

465
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,958
Look, gramps, I've got some
shit to take care of, sorry.

466
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,583
Quit hitting on
old people, Panty!

467
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,208
We got shit to take care of;

468
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,958
and I want to get back
before my pie burns.

469
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,250
It's not always
about pie, ya know!

470
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,583
Okay, panties,
you know the drill.

471
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,708
After we eliminate
this human excrement,

472
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,416
we'll have taken
out the big three.

473
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,458
We're so good.

474
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,583
Repent, mother fucker!

475
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,291
Ridiculous.

476
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,625
Only one Heaven?

477
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,791
Yeah, he was pretty disgusting,

478
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,791
but, I guess he
wasn't very strong.

479
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:48,666
Excuse me.

480
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,333
What?

481
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,250
My daughter.

482
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,291
She's a big fan.

483
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,916
And it's her birthday.

484
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,833
I thought he was gonna
try to get us into

485
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,708
his white van to help
look for his lost puppy.

486
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:02,958
I know.

487
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,375
What, are we supposed
to talk to every fan?

488
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,625
Well, when you're as famous

489
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,916
and fuckable as me,
what can you expect?

490
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,458
Chi, honey!

491
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,208
Can you do me a favor?

492
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,083
Granny can't hear me;
will you please go get her?

493
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,375
Okay!

494
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,333
Granny!

495
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,583
Open your fucking ears!

496
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,916
You know, Terao.

497
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,750
I didn't want to
bring this up again.

498
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,791
To be honest, I never
want to bring it up.

499
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,875
I'm sorry, sir.

500
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,166
But it's been another
month in a row

501
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,958
that you haven't
met your quota.

502
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:00,833
I'm sorry, sir.

503
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:01,916
You're always sorry!

504
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,833
It's the same
discussion every month,

505
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,583
and I know it's hard for you,
but imagine my position.
