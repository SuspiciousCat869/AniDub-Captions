131
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,275
of the year, Eve?

132
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,245
It's known as Ogre Day
here in the village.

133
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,346
How come?

134
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,616
That's because the ogre

135
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,586
all our young children.

136
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,588

legend has it

137
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,189
you must never go outside

138
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,425
or even open
the door for anyone.

139
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,626
Oh.

140
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,795
And while we're here
locked up inside the house,

141
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,164
we're also supposed to pray
that Colona will come

142
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,700
and take the bad
ogre away for us.

143
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,068
Who is Colona?

144
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,905
Colona is the sun god
who protects us from the ogre.

145
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,107
Protects us from the ogre?

146
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,543
Mm‐hmm.

147
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,479
Colona the sun god
is very powerful, dear.

148
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,348
Although he's strong,
he's gentle

149
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,385
and has a warm and kind heart.

150
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,786
That's the story.

151
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,521
Do you think I
could meet Colona?

152
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,589
Eve.

153
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,691
Why can't you understand
that no means no?

154
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,360
But he only comes
out once a year.

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,662
You don't mind if
the ogre gets you?

156
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,796
He will if you go outside.

157
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,964
Colona will save me even if

158
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,466
that ogre does catch me.

159
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,800
She's impossible.

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,369
Eve, time for bed.

161
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,504
No, I wanna go see Colona.

162
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,907
Children who don't listen
to their parents get taken away

163

164
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,576
Grandpa.

165
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,044
