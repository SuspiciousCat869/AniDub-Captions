Yes, Tiger is right, Monol.

342
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,967
Obviously,

343
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,604
his work is not yet done.

344
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,239
What does that mean?

345
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:50,142
Perhaps Moo's mind
has attached itself

346
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,078
to another body.

347
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,646
Attached itself?

348
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,948
That doesn't sound good.

349
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,184
So, Moo existed a long time ago,

350
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,652
then he was sort of destroyed,

351
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,121
but not really, and now he's
trying to start it again,

352
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,256
is that it?

353
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,958
I am not going to let him do it!

354
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,126
Chi!

355
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,095
Well, that's why we're
looking for the Phoenix

356
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,098
so we can revive it and put
an end to Moo's evil ways.

357
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,966
What she said!

358
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,768
Now, here's a question for you.

359
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,704
If Moo's mind has
been floating around,

360
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,274
what does that mean
for the Phoenix?

361
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,675
Get outta here, Hare!

362
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,644
You mean even if
we find the Phoenix,

363
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,178
we won't be able
to retrieve him

364
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,847
because his mind
won't be there, too?

365
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,049
Come on, that's
just too depressing.

366
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,218
Well, what do you think, Monol?

367
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,719
Patience.
