[NARRATOR]
Arslan and his companions

2
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,041
put an end to Shaghad's plot

3
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,083
and freed the port city of Gilan
from his corrupt influence.

4
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,375
Unfortunately, the peace was
short-lived,

5
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,500
ending when an unexpected
visitor arrived in Gilan

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,583
seeking an audience with Arslan.

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,000
Just slow down.

8
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,625
Gather your thoughts,
then tell me what's going on.

9
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,541
It's King Innocentis.
He's being held prisoner.

[BOTH gasp]

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,375
He asked me to help him,
and I did my best.

13
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:05,041
But instead I was framed
and branded a traitor.

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,458
I didn't know what I could do
or where else I could go.

15
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,750
So, I came here.

16
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,541
I'm in no position
to ask for favors,

17
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,333
but please, will you
march to Ecbatana

18
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,125
and free His Majesty?

19
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,041
[GUISCARD] My Lord Brother
survived the attack on his life.

20
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,666
We are fortunate indeed that
he was not taken from us.

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,875
He may rule for years yet.

22
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,083
See that he is well
guarded as he recovers.

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,125
Sir.

24
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,333
We must bring Silver
Mask to justice.

25
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,333
He has made it clear that
he is no longer our ally.

26
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,750
I want him dead!
No matter what it takes!

[SOLDIERS yelling]

28
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,458
Guiscard's persistent.

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,708
Looks like he's sent the whole
Lusitanian army after us.

30
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,583
Charge the enemy!
Protect your Prince!

31
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,708
Damn it!

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER I]
There're too many!

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER J]
Retreat!

34

[ZANDEH]
Lord S! Good to see you.

35
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,833
And you. Thought we
could lend a hand.

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,750
We appreciate it.
What of Zabul?

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,041
We set fire to the fortress
upon our departure.

38
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,583
[ZANDEH]
You did what?

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,791
[SM] A long-standing order
from His Highness.

40
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,208
It felt like a waste,

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,916
but better that than let
the Lusitanians have it.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,458
He's correct.

43
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,291
Zabul was a small, outlying
fortress of little consequence.

44
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,958
You did well to burn it.

45
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
[SM]
Sir.

46
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,791
And what of Rukhnabad?
Did you find it?

47
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,333
Yes, in what once was Maryam.

48
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,083
Very well. Then that
is where we are headed.

49
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,000
I will have that sword.

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,166
The King has been
removed from power.

51
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,750
Prince Guiscard rules now.
He's the King's own brother.

52
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,291
How could he conspire
against His Majesty?

53
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,500
It's nothing new.

54
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,500
He may not have the title,

55
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,958
but Guiscard has
held all the power

56
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,750
in Lusitania for some time.

57
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,541
That aside, do you understand
what you're asking of us?

58
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,875
Your King invaded Pars.

59
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,500
Yes, I know that!

60
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,333
I do. I realize that what
I'm asking is crazy.

61
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,000
Even so, I had to try.

62
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,083
I didn't know who I could
turn to besides you.

63
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,666
I'm glad you came, but--

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh. Well.

65
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,958
I see there have been some
interesting developments

66
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,000
while I was away.

67
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,250
And here I didn't
think the Prince

68
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,083
was particularly skilled
in that department.

69
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,250
Keep your speculations
to yourself.

70
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,958
[GIEVE]
Mistress Farangis told me we had

71
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,250
some unexpected visitors,

72
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,791
and I can see now exactly
how correct she was.

73
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,958
Of course I was correct.
The Djinn don't lie.

74
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,791
By the bye, who is this
strapping young man?

75
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,458
My name is Merlane.
I'm a member of the Zot Clan.

76
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,041
Wait, the Zot Clan?

77
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,916
I hadn't planned
to seek you out,

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,291
but then Étoile
told me that my--

79

[ALFARáD] I heard
Étoile's here. Is it true?

00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,083
Oh, hey, big brother.

82
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,333
That's her brother?

There's nothing I
wanna talk about!

Quit pretending you've
forgotten our father's wishes!

[ALFARáD]
I don't care what he said.

91
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,250
I have no interest
in becoming Chief!

She say Chief?

93
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,916
I don't see why you
just can't do it.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,625
You're older than I am,
and I don't want to!

95
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,625
But I'm not the
one Father chose.

96

And I certainly can't ignore
the man's dying wish!

97
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,166
[ALFARáD]
Why not?

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,791
It's not like you and
he got along anyway.

If I can ignore what he
wanted, then so can you!

Are you joking? She's next
in line to be clan chief?

No! I am Narsus's wife,
and that's all I want to be!

Wouldn't it be a good
idea for you to step in

103
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,500
and say something
right about now?

concerns you too, after all.

cut him down instead!

Interesting.

to do all along.

[ZARAVANT] I am a knight
of Pars, and as such,

my position dictates
that I serve His Majesty.

Still.

145
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,125
I saw how he treated the Prince.

it makes me furious.

Do not be ruled by your temper.

Remember why we're
fighting in the first place.

We are trying to free
the people of Pars.

Our main concern is ridding
our kingdom of invaders.

Is it?

00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,208
This life can be
ugly and unfair.

161
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,833
Best not to take
it too seriously.

162
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,750
[KISHWARD]
Can I ask you something?

163
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,083
Why are you here? Why did
you remain at Peshawar?

164
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,875
I recall the battle of
Atropatene well enough.

165
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,750
Didn't you abandon the line
of battle before anyone else?

166
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,541
I wasn't keen on
following a ruler

167
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,375
who would run from
the battlefield.

168
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,958
That hasn't changed.

169
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,791
To be honest, I'm a
lot more interested

170
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,083
to find out what the future
holds for young Prince Arslan.

171
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,166
Making it all the more
strange that you stayed.

172
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,166
We Marzbs are a rare breed
at this point, Kishward.

173
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,083
Not many of us left.

174
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,000
I dunno, guess I couldn't
stand the thought

175
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,500
of your pitiful face if
I left you here all alone.

176
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,333
[laughing]

177
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,666
[KISHWARD]
I wonder...

178
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,791
What does the future hold
for Prince Arslan?

179
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,916
[clatter]

180
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,833
[KISHWARD]
What's this?

181
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,750
Elder Vahriz sent a
message before his death.

182
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,083
Lord Bahman must have hidden it.

183
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,125
And he took care
to hide it well.

184
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,791
No surprise it wasn't
found until today.

185
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,125
I wonder what could have
been so important.

186
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,500
Hello, Lord Kishward.

187
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,583
Good evening, My Lady Queen.

188
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,958
Forgive me, but I wasn't
expecting you at such an hour.

189
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,833
I'll take that paper
you hold into my keeping.

190
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,833
A loyal servant of the
Crown has no need of it.

191
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,208
I am pleased, Lord Kishward.

192
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,791
It seems that you are more than
a valiant soldier and general.

193
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,375
You fully understand your place
as a servant of the Crown.

194
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,375
I, for one, believe
the Kingdom of Parse

195
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,958
is lucky to have you.

196
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,000
And I'm pleased to
learn no rift has arisen

197
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,166
between Lord and vassal after
what has recently transpired.

198
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,833
Sir... If I may ask.

199
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,250
[ANDRAGORAS]
Yes?

200
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,250
Before Lord Bahman's death,

201
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,750
he changed suddenly
and inexplicably.

202
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,041
Could it have been due to the
contents of that message?

203
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,750
That is possible.

204
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,208
However...

205
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,208
[KISHWARD gasps]

206
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,208
What's done is done.
The past cannot be changed.

207
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,666
[ANDRAGORAS] Human nature
is a dark, twisted thing.

208
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,416
There may be those who
like to pretend otherwise,

209
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,541
but even royals are human.

210
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,291
There is not a royal
family in this world

211
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,500
that is beyond reproach.

212
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,583
Does not matter if they
are adorned with jewels

213
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,208
and draped in the finest silks.

214
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,791
Look past those
trappings of wealth

215
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,333
and do you know
what you will find?

216
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,250
Lies, bloodshed, and intrigue.

217
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,875
Do you understand?

218
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,041
I do.

219
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,125
[KISHWARD] If the blood of
the royal family of Pars

220
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,375
truly does not flow through
Prince Arslan's veins,

221
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,666
then that means he has
nothing to do with the spell

222
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,750
that binds the royal family.

223
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,708
And if that is the case,

224
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,333
it could be a wonderful
thing indeed.

225
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,291
[ARSLAN]
Interesting.

226
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,791
I didn't realize that
things had fallen

227
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,666
into such disorder
in Ecbatana.

228
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,666
This may very well turn
out to be a situation

229
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
that we can use
to our advantage.

230
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,958
Yes.

231
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,541
All I'm asking is that you
help me rescue His Majesty.

232
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,416
Then our troops will
withdraw quietly.

233
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,833
We will return any riches
we have plundered,

234
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,000
and offer apology to the dead.

235
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,250
I promise you.

236
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,250
Except that your promise
is not the one we need.

237
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,416
How can you presume to
offer us such assurances

238
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,583
when you are neither the ruler
of Lusitania nor its Regent?

239
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,750
I know I can persuade
my Lord King.

240
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,083
He'll understand the situation.
He will listen. He's a good man.

241
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,083
Oh, I'm sure he's
a wonderful man.

242
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,250
Thanks to him a million
Parsians are dead.

243
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,041
He could be the nicest
person in the world

244
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,666
and it wouldn't matter.

245
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,750
A man can only be judged by the
right and wrong of his actions.

246
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,541
[ARSLAN]
The one who holds power

247
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,458
has no understanding of
his responsibilities,

248
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,708
and the one who does
understand the responsibilities

She bears the burden

00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,291
of this senseless situation all
on her own.

They've set out from Peshawar.
They're on the way to Ecbatana.

What?

[BODIN] O devout followers

Now here we stand,
united in our faith.

261
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,041
From this devastated land
that once was Maryam,

262
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,625
we launch our holy war anew

263
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,041
to cleanse this world
of the heathen menace.

and brought back this prize.

It is the treasured sword
of Pars. Rukhnabad!

270
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,416
The Parsians are
weak and foolish.

They won't stand before us.

I hold their precious sword.

What better proof could there
be that God has forsaken them?

274
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,000
Our God bids us to bring
his light to the heathens

275
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,083
and destroy them
if they will not see.

We will rule this Earth

00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,500
Yes, this is where you
belong. In my hands.

318
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,541
O great Rukhnabad.

319
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,416
[SM]
This is as it should be.

320
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,541
To bring order to
the chaos in Pars,

321
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,125
our only choice is to
follow the rightful King.

322
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,666
At last, it is time.

323
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,625
To consign the
usurper to oblivion.

324
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,250
And retake the Royal Capital!

325
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,333
Now it's time we
march to Ecbatana.

326
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,041
Highness, our
troop strength is...

327
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,666
Low. We're well short
of the 50,000 we need.

328
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes.

329
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,125
[GIEVE] I'm not the tactical
genius around here,

330
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,208
but wouldn't it be considerably
more convenient

331
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,458
for us to stay where we are

332
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,041
and let the others sort
things out themselves?

333
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,708
A tempting idea,
but no. We can't.

334
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,916
First and foremost, know this.

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,666
We remain loyal to
Pars and her King.

336
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,833
That being said, here are
my thoughts on the matter.

337
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,125
Zealotry, prejudice, and hatred
have harmed Lusitanians.

338
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,083
More than anything else.

339
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,625
If they can see that,

340
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,541
there will be no more
need for us to fight them.

341
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,250
What are you saying,
Your Highness?

342
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,625
You won't kill the enemy?

343
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,291
[ARSLAN] I do not believe
there is any reason

344
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,291
to destroy a whole people.

345
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,125
In my opinion,
it would be enough

346
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,916
for them just to leave Pars.

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,666
As for my father, I doubt
he will show any mercy.

348
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,250
He will annihilate them,
and in doing so,

349
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
perpetuate the cycle
of bloodshed.

350
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,666
We can't let that happen.

351
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,458
Somebody has to stop him, and we
are the only people who can!

352
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,708
Daryun. Narsus.
There must be a way.

353
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,625
A path that is my own
and not my Lord Father's.

354
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,625
Is that not right?

355
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,791
Yes indeed, Your Highness.
Quite right.

356
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,166
Then we are all in
agreement. Good.

357
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,750
And if our plan also
accomplishes Étoile's goals,

358
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,458
surely there's nothing
so wrong with that.

359
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,375
Open the doors now.

360
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,333
Sir.

361
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,333
Eavesdropping?

362
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,833
Forgive me, but
do you mean to say

363
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,708
we're going through
with the girl's plan?

364
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm confused, Highness.

365
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,750
More like incorporating
it into our own.

366
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,583
Go, don't be shy!

367
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,250
Seems you've been outwitted.
How does it feel?

368
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,291
[NARSUS sighs]

369
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,083
Guess it was bound to happen.
This is the path we must take.

370
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,625
You have spoken with great
wisdom and eloquence, Highness,

371
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,416
and your words will
form the foundation

372
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,333
of our future policies.

373
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,375
The wind is strong today.

374
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,916
Once the sun rises,

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,666
I am sure we will see the dust
clouds dance most fiercely.

376
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,791
Yes.

377
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,958
Now, men, follow your King

378
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,583
and be certain you
do not fall behind.

379
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,875
[GUISCARD] Look at how
run-down and lifeless

380
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,125
this city has become.

381
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,833
It's barely worth
fighting for anymore.

382
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,875
Even so, my rage
remains undiminished.

383
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,125
I hate these filthy heathens,
and their bestial King.

384
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,416
I want that man dead. Dead!

385
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,541
We will show these Parsian fools
just how unwise it is to resist.

386
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,750
And when we're finished,

387
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,000
they'll know who is
truly the supreme ruler

388
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,958
of the Continental Highway!

389
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,500
Daryun.

390
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,500
Sir.

391
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,250
Should the worst happen,

392
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,250
it is possible that I
will end up in conflict

393
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,666
with my Lord Father,

394
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,291
and I've dragged all
of you into it with me.

395
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,083
You didn't drag me anywhere.

396
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,125
I follow you willingly,
Your Highness,

397
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,916
and nothing is going
to change that.

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,083
[NARSUS]
We are heading down a path

399
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,958
from which there
can be no return.

400
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,791
Narsus. Do you have to
sound so happy about it?

401
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,083
Why shouldn't I?

402
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,208
His Highness is embarking
on a great journey.

403
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,958
How can I not rejoice?

404
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,083
Don't even try to tell
me you're not excited.

405
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,458
I can see it on your face.

406
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,625
What? You cannot!

407
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,958
[ARSLAN laughing]

408
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,041
There's nothing more comforting
than the two of you bickering.

409
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,666
Daryun. Narsus.

410
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,208
Ecbatana will be ours again.

411
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,875
Yes, sir!

412
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,750
Indeed, Your Highness.

413
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,250
All right, men,
the time has come.

414
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,958
Today we march for
the Royal Capital!

415
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS yells]

416
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,791
[ARSLAN] There is still
so much about my identity

417
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
that I am unsure of.

418
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:25,375
However, that doesn't seem
as important as it once did.

419
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,416
I am a vessel.
I can become anyone.

420
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,500
And so, I shall become the King
that everyone wishes me to be.

421
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,750
[NARRATOR]
After many bloody months,

422
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,375
all the forces vying
for control of Pars

423
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,416
were at last charging toward
a single point on the map:

424
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,000
The Royal Capital of Ecbatana.

425
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,833
Born of fear, and anger,
and determination,

426
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,541
a bloody storm would arise
in the narrow space

427
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,875
between the Heavens
and the Earth.

428
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:01,375
In the midst of the bloodshed
and dancing dust clouds,

429
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:05,958
history was about to take yet
another transformative turn.

430
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,625
[Yashasuiin!
