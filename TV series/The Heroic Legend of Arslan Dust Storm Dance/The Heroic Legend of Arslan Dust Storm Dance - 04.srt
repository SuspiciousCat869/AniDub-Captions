1
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,833
[NARRATOR]
The treasured sword Rukhnabad

2
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,666
is seen as proof of
kingship in Pars.

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,416
Gieve and Hilmes fought
for possession of the sword,

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,750
only to watch in dismay
as it was carried off

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,041
by the remnants of
the Temple Knights.

6
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:48,416
Hilmes immediately set out to
follow Archpriest Bodin's trail.

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,625
[BOTH yelling]

8
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,833
You might as well
give up now, bastard!

9
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:00,916
[BANDIT C]
You're dead!

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,750
[BANDIT E]
We're gonna kill you all!

11
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:08,583
It's only a troop of bandits.
Nothing to do with us.

12
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,000
[BANDIT D] You think
you're some kinda hero?

13
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,916
You should go.

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,750
Do not waste your life.

15
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,750
I've accompanied you this far.

16
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,541
There's no way I'm
going to give up now.

17
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,541
[JOVANNA]
My lady, get back!

18
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,583
[BANDIT C]
Die!

19
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,208
Who is that?
He's wearing a mask.

20
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,541
[BANDIT D]
Get them!

21
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,458
[yelling]

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
[MERLANE] We owe you
our lives. Many thanks.

23
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,625
It's lucky for us that a couple
of Parsian Knights

24
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,375
happened to be in the area.

25
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,083
Pardon.

26
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,208
[JOVANNA]
My lady!

27
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,666
You men are from Pars?

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,625
We are searching for
a countryman of yours,

29
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,291
a Prince Hilmes.

30
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,791
Perhaps you'd be able to tell
us where we might find him?

31
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,875
I'm sorry, but I don't
think we can help you.

32
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
I know that voice.

33
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,416
Lord Hilmes, is that you?

34
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,291
[IRINA] Lord Hilmes.
That is you, isn't it?

35
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,250
I am Irina. Princess of Maryam.

36
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,041
You must know me!

37
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,041
I said I cannot help you.

38
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,625
You pig! Can't you at
least show some courtesy?

39
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,083
[HILMES]
If you're headed for Ecbatana,

40
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,708
I would advise against it.

41
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,916
Take that token and make
for Zabul Fortress instead.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They will give you protection.

43
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,541
[MERLANE]
Hey! Don't walk away!

44
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,083
We should do as he suggested.

45
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,625
Let's set out for
Zabul Fortress.

46
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,291
Should we turn back, sir?

47
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,208
That woman. She seemed
to know who you were.

48
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,291
[HILMES]
That's none of your business.

49
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,875
Right.

50
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,583
[HILMES]
I have yet to regain the throne

51
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,666
that was stolen from me.

52
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,458
How could I even think
about facing her?

53
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,750
[screams]

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,458
[HILMES]
Lord Uncle!

55
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,583
Why would you do this?

56
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,625
[SANJEH]
As far as everybody knows,

57
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,666
you died in the fire
as you were supposed to.

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,500
Who the hell are you?

59
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:26,500
[SANJEH]
No one in particular.

60
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,041
If it matters, I knew your
Grandfather, Gotarzes the 2nd.

61
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,166
[HILMES]
Was it you?

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,166
Were you the one who saved me?

63
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,500
It was your bitter hatred
that drew me to you.

64
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,291
You summoned us with the rage
you felt against your uncle,

65
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,125
the rage you felt
against the world.

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,791
Why did you save my life?
What do you want from me?

67
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,291
Oh, not much, only
chaos and disaster.

68
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,875
I imagine you'll create both

69
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,625
when the time comes for you
to pursue your revenge.

70
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,958
It will be some years yet,

71
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,875
but I believe that it
will be worth the wait.

72
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,666
For now, you must leave Pars,

73
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,416
but you will return to us when
you've grown stronger.

74
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,541
And then, we will be
your eyes and ears

75
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,666
as you fight to
reclaim what you lost.

76
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,916
[HILMES]
You wished to see me?

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,875
I hear that you were up
in the middle of the night

78
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,541
practicing with your sword.

79
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,208
I'm harboring you
out of kindness.

80
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,916
Don't take that for granted.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Understand? I don't
want you doing anything

82
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,666
that will arouse
undue suspicion.

83
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,000
Behave yourself.

84
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
If folk knew you were
that Parsian King's brat,

85
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,458
I'd be in serious trouble.

86
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,208
Though I suppose that you're not

87
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,541
the only problem
child around here.

88
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,333
[GORNER chuckles]

89
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,625
[HILMES] What's wrong
with you? Are you blind?

90
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,500
Why bother gathering flowers?

91
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,250
[IRINA]
I can't see them.

92
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,291
But that doesn't mean I
don't enjoy smelling them.

93
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,666
Do you know this flower?
It's called the zeria.

94
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,333
Oh?

95
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,291
Its petals are bluish-purple.

96
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,375
And they fade gradually into
white toward the center.

97
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,916
They're round and full. And...
Words can only do so much.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,041
Here. Try feeling it.

99
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,708
A zeria.

100
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,833
And what do they call you?

101
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,416
Are you so shy?

102
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
[HILMES]
Hilmes.

103
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,833
Hello, Lord Hilmes.

104
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,833
[HILMES]
Stop!

105
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,916
A bandage.
So you're injured then.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,291
Well, as long as you have that,

107
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,791
I won't mistake you
for someone else.

108
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,708
Are you going to
tell me your name?

109
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
Well, since you ask, I'm Irina.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,250
[JOVANNA]
My lady!

111
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,708
Must I always chase after you?

112
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,666
There's such a chill
in the air today.

113
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,333
And you know your
health isn't good.

114
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,208
Won't you please come inside?

115
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,125
Is something the matter?

116
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:35,291
[IRINA laughing]

117
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,375
We can't stay out much longer.

118
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,875
They'll be worried about you.

119
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,875
[IRINA] Not Jovanna. She'll
be running errands all day.

120
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,166
And I can assure you that
everybody else at the castle

121
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,916
will be perfectly happy
not to have me around.

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,875
Is that because of your eyes?

123
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,208
[IRINA]
Yes.

124
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,916
Princesses aren't supposed
to be blind, you know.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,916
[IRINA]
Now, Lord Hilmes,

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,916
will you tell me what
the clouds look like?

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,708
[HILMES] Hm. Well they're
particularly large today.

128
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,458
[IRINA]
How large are they?

129
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,750
I'd say they're almost
as big as countries.

130
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,875
Wow!

131
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,041
And they're floating
away quickly.

132
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,083
Like they have
someplace else to be.

133
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,041
[IRINA] Listening to
you describe things,

134
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,708
I feel like I can see.

135
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,541
It makes me happy.

136
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,333
[HILMES]
Talking to me makes you happy?

137
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,583
Yes.

138
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,125
I'm glad.

139
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,000
[HILMES]
You know, Irina,

140
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,833
on the other side of this sea
lies the Kingdom of Pars.

141
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,083
[IRINA]
Yes.

142
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,333
From what I hear, it's a
very prosperous country.

143
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:42,458
You should know.
I'm actually a Prince of Pars.

144
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,000
[IRINA]
Huh?

145
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,666
[HILMES] For now I must live
like this, hiding my identity.

146
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,000
But someday I will
take the throne back.

147
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,583
I don't understand.

148
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,125
[HILMES]
Once I'm King,

149
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,041
I'll be able to return
and help you.

150
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,916
I'll come back to Maryam.
And free you.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,125
[gasps]

152
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,208
It seems the time has come.

153
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,416
[HILMES]
You! It's been so long.

154
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,541
I thought you'd like to know

155
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,416
that King Andragoras
has given his son

156
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
the title of Crown Prince.

157
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,666
Crown Prince? That title
belongs to me and no one else!

158
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,041
If you're interested,
the boy's name is Arslan.

159
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,875
Seek what's yours.
Follow your destiny.

160
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,750
Your path will
reveal itself to you.

161
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,333
Hey!

162
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,916
Lusitanian soldiers?
What's happening?

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,333
[GORNER]
It won't be long now.

164
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,500
Maryam is already on
the verge of surrendering

165
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,041
to the Lusitanian invaders.

166
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,958
It would be a good idea
to be on the winning side.

167
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,375
Don't you think?

168
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,750
[HILMES]
You bastard!

169
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,375
Selling out your own country?!

170
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,958
Well, the price was right.

171
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,458
And I thought I might as well
sell you while I was at it.

172
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,333
Along with the poor,
blind Princess.

173
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
Can't let her go
to waste, can we?

174
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,416
Get back!

175
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,291
No, stop! I can help you!
Please just spare me!

176
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,291
[JOVANNA]
This way, my lady.

177
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,625
The guards! They'll come
to help, won't they?

178
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,916
Hello, there. I think we're
gonna have fun together.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,333
[chuckles]

180
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,958
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER H]
Who are you?

181
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,333
Lord Hilmes!
That is you, isn't it?

182
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,958
Stay away!

183
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,083
[HILMES] This is the
beginning of everything.

184
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,625
I'm sorry. I have to go.

185
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,750
Lord Hilmes, please--

186
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,791
My name is Prince Hilmes.

187
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,125
My father's name was Osroes.

188
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:34,791
And I am the rightful
King of Pars.

189
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,833
The throne is mine!

190
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,125
[HILMES] I never thought
we would meet again,

191
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,208
and certainly not like this.

192
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,291
Irina.

193
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,041
[MESSENGER A]
A report from Lord S.

194
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,625
[ZANDEH]
Did he find their trail?

195
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,041
Yes.

196
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,458
The Temple Knights have traveled
to what was once Maryam.

197
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,958
They're in contact with members
of the former royalty there.

198
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,458
[HILMES] So, Archpriest Bodin
hopes to use ruined nobles

199
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,375
to regain his power.

200
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,041
Let's go, Zandeh.

201
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,541
Yes, sir!

202
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,541
[NARRATOR] Peshawar Fortress
was in a state of shock.

203
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,458
King Andragoras had escaped
his Lusitanian captors

204
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
and made his way to the border,

205
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,833
bringing Queen Tahamenay
along with him.

206
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,500
These are my orders,
Arslan. Listen well.

207
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,750
I will require more
men to retake Pars,

208
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,166
and you will assemble
them for me.

209
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,250
And don't bother showing
your face here again

210
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,916
until you amassed a force
of at least 50,000.

211
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,500
[ARSLAN] Sir, I humbly
accept the royal mandate.

212
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,416
What are you waiting for?

213
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,375
You've received your
orders, haven't you?

214
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,875
Make the necessary provisions
and depart immediately.

215
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,333
Majesty.

216
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,916
I don't doubt the Crown Prince
will obey your mandate,

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,833
as is only proper.

218
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,875
And, if your Majesty
does not object,

219
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,166
those of us who have served
His Highness thus far

220
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,333
would humbly request
to continue doing so.

221
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,166
No, Narsus. I will require
your services here.

222
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,250
As well as Daryun's.

223
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,791
You do not have my permission
to accompany Arslan.

224
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,916
He may not use the word,
but this is banishment!

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,708
Considering everything
Prince Arslan has accomplished,

226
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,083
he should be celebrated.

227
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,083
It seems the stories about
the tyrant of Pars were true.

228
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,000
Rumors say Arslan is not
of Andragoras's blood.

229
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,583
Given the difference
in their temperaments,

230
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,125
that does seem more
and more plausible.

231
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,125
The Queen didn't even
bother to see him.

232
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,750
[NARSUS] It's possible that
the King wouldn't let her.

233
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,083
If it was her own choice,
then it was a cruel one.

234
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,916
At any rate, we have
plans to make.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,916
Our goal had been to
reach the Royal Capital

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,750
and rescue His Majesty
from the Lusitanians.

237
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,000
Clearly, that has now changed.

238
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,166
It's not complicated.

239
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,083
I'll serve Prince Arslan
and that's all there is to it.

240
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,000
If I were to leave
his service now,

241
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,625
the last High Kahina's spirit
would cast a curse upon me.

242
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,166
To be perfectly honest,

243
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,666
I fear a curse from the dead
far more than the King's wrath.

244
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,875
And what about you, Gieve?
What will you do?

245
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,666
I feel no particular obligation

246
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,333
to obey the so-called-King,
Andragoras.

247
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,750
Interesting.

248
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,958
It almost sounds as if
you're enjoying this conflict

249
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,041
that's arisen between
the King and Prince Arslan.

250
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,375
Oh really? Is that
what it sounds like?

251
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
Yes, it absolutely is.

252
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,458
Well! I never knew you were a
mind-reader, Mistress Farangis.

253
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,833
What a delightful discovery!

254
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,125
Must you always be so obnoxious?

255
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,416
Your timing couldn't
be worse if you tried.

256
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,958
What are you doing here?

257
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,791
Sorry to drop in like this,
but the soldiers are watching.

258
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,250
I have a message
from Lord Narsus.

259
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,583
[ARSLAN]
I thought I was ready for this.

260
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,458
Surely if I was his true son,
he wouldn't have sent me away.

261
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,541
But--

262
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,041
No. I will not think
of this as banishment.

263
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,583
But as being given my freedom.

264
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:10,125
Because that way,
I don't have to hate him.

265
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,833
My friends, thank
you for everything.

266
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
[KISHWARD] Your Majesty,
I thought you might like to know

267
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,125
that Crown Prince
Arslan has departed.

268
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,458
Tell me, Kishward.

269
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,250
What comes first to you,
loyalty to the kingdom,

270
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,791
or loyalty to Arslan?

271
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,000
[KISHWARD]
Sir.

272
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,541
I don't think anyone
could doubt that I am,

273
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,833
and always have been,
a loyal subject of Pars.

274
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,500
I promise that my loyalty
has never wavered.

275
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,375
If that's true,
then bend the knee.

276
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
Swear fealty to
your rightful King

277
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,625
and pledge your life
into my service.

278
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,875
[KISHWARD]
Yes, sir!

279
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,291
Do something! Why are
you just sitting there?

280
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,500
You fret unnecessarily, Daryun.

281
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,166
Really, it's not as
if His Highness

282
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,708
is headed for
enemy country.

283
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,166
He's been exil--

284
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,000
[tapping]

285
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,916
[DARYUN]
"Play along."

286
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,041
[NARSUS] I've explained the
situation to Elam and Alfar+d.

287
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,916
They're taking care of it.

288
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,208
Right. Sorry.
I was overreacting.

289
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,666
I'm sure His Highness will
be fine without our help.

290
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,583
[NARSUS] They may be young,
but they're clever.

291
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,708
They know what to do.
Of that I have no doubt.

292
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,375
We just have to trust
them and wait.

293
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,000
[PARSIAN SOLDIER A]
Fire!

294
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,541
[PARSIAN SOLDIER B]
Hurry!

295
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,583
What's that?

296
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,416
What's going on?

297
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E]
I'm sorry, sir.

298
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
The stables and
watchtowers are on fire!

299
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,708
What?

300
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,916
[PARSIAN SOLDIER F]
Get water! Quick!

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,750
[PARSIAN SOLDIER H]
Don't let it spread!

302
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,166
[PARSIAN SOLDIER G]
Lord Daryun!

303
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,333
Get out of my way!

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,916
Go notify Lord Kishward!

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,958
Right!

306
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,125
Sindhura is my homeland,

307
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,958
and I left it for one reason
and one reason only:

308
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,041
Because I owe my life to
Prince Arslan thrice over.

309
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,875
I have no intention
of leaving his side

310
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,000
until I have repaid him.

311
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,791
Honor is such a
cumbersome thing.

312
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIER L]
Halt!

313
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,750
But I suppose there's
no helping it, is there?

314
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,125
A man must be true to his heart.

315
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,916
[ELAM]
Lord Narsus!

316
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,625
Damn it!

317
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,791
[ALFARID]
Narsus!

318
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,791
Keep moving!

319
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,833
Right!

320
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,916
Stand down, Kishward.

321
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,041
Turn back now.
Before it's too late.

322
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,958
[DARYUN]
I'm doing what I must.

323
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,541
I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.

324
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,291
Please, step aside.

325
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,833
I wish I could, Daryun.

326
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,208
But I still have my orders,

327
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,875
and I cannot disobey
the King of Pars.

328
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,125
[DARYUN] I understand
why you feel that way.

329
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,958
And I hope that you
understand my choice

330
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,000
to stand by Prince
Arslan as well.

331
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,958
[KISHWARD] You seek to honor
Elder Vahriz's final wish.

332
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,041
That's part of it. It's true.

333
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,666
But more than anything,
I'm doing this for myself!

334
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,791
Very well then.
I have no choice.

335
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
I'm sorry.
I cannot let you pass.

336
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,333
I'll do everything
I can to stop you!

337
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,708
[yelling]

338
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,166
I'm not going to make
this easy for you.

339
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,875
I must do my duty to my King!

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,416
Even with you as my opponent,
I will hold nothing back!

341
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,208
[yells]

342
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,916
[FARANGIS]
I have to admit,

343
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,541
I find your notion
of honor ridiculous.

344
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,916
You spoke a vow to your King,

345
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,583
and now you're
bound by it forever.

346
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,000
Yet you don't give a damn

347
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,541
whether following that vow
is the right thing to do.

348
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,250
Coming?

349
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,416
Indeed.

350
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,000
[FARANGIS] Let's gain as
much ground as we can.

351
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,541
What are you waiting for?
After them! Go!

352
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

353
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,166
[KISHWARD]
I'm sure you will do your best.

354
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,500
But against them, I doubt
that you will succeed.

355
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:45,541
[AZRAEL crying]

356
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,000
[ARSLAN]
Time to go.

357
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:11,041
[AZRAEL crying]

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,791
It's Azrael!

359
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,166
I guess I'm not
completely alone.

360
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,000
[DARYUN]
Your Highness!

361
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,833
[ARSLAN]
Daryun! Narsus! Elam! Farangis!

362
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,416
Alfar+d! Gieve! Jaswant!

363
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,500
Your Highness, we're willing
to accept your rebuke,

364
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,083
and we will endure
His Majesty's anger,

365
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,708
but we believe we can give
our lives as we see fit.

366
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:04,458
And so we offer them
to you, my Prince.

367
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,541
It's been a very long
and very difficult road.

368
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,333
And yet through all of it,
you have stood by me.

369
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,875
Well, we should get going.
We have much to do.

370
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,208
[ALFARID chuckles]

371
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,791
Not going to yell at us?
Or tell us to leave?

372
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,083
At this point, I know it
would be a waste of breath.

373
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,875
How could I ever think
to send you away?

374
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,833
Surely the gods would
punish such idiocy.

375
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,708
I'm so glad you came.

376
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,208
I could not do this without you.

377
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,666
[NARRATOR] Prince Arslan's
path was no longer

378
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,833
a sad and solitary one.

379
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,208
To do as King Andragoras
had ordered,

380
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:01,666
he still needed 49,993 soldiers.

381
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,750
But with his friends
at his back,

382
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,291
at least he wouldn't be
seeking them alone.

383
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,041
They set off for the south
to the port of Gilan.

384
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,458
[NARRATOR] Shaghad is a
distant relative of Narsus.

385
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:51,583
His father's elder sister's
husband's cousin's son?

386
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:54,958
Next time, "A City of Land
and a City of Water."

387
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,916
And thus would the
boy become King.
