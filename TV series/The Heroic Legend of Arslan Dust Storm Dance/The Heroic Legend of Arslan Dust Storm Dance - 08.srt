[NARRATOR]
Safdie Island.

2
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,875
Also known as Treasure
Island by the pirates,

3
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,916
who claimed it was home
to the hidden treasure

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,541
of a legendary Pirate King.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,875
Upon learning of the
supposed treasure,

6
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,916
some of Arslan's party
set out for the island.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,458
Surely such riches would make
for an enviable war chest.

8
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,333
One hundred million gold pieces.

9
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,916
I find such a great number
difficult to believe.

10

[ALFARáD] It would take someone
a long time to count that high.

11
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,625
We couldn't ask for a better
opportunity than this.

12
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,666
The prince's most valued
fighters have set off

13

in search of a
nonexistent treasure.

14
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,708
Their absence leaves his
headquarters thinly defended

15
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,375
and ripe for the taking.

16
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,916
Soon this city will
be ours once more.

[PIRATES yelling]

Poor, Narsus.

If only you had been content
to remain in seclusion,

21
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,125

Yeah.

The little Princeling fell for
it hook, line, and sinker.

What's going on?

Quick! The pirates

The pirates have attacked!
They're headed this way!

30
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,416
They made no move until Daryun
and the others had departed.

31
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,958
Clearly, this is being
orchestrated from the inside.

32
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,375
Surely not!

33
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,833
Under Viceroy Pelagius's rule,
nothing like this ever--

Oh! I mean--

This building will be
their primary target.

Yes, sir!

It's unfolding just as
Lord Narsus said it would.

Well, of course. Narsus's
calculations are never wrong.

40
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,250
No, he's been wrong once.

Allowing you to
remain by his side.

It may be the only incorrect
decision of his whole life,

but it's a serious one.

[SHAGHAD]
There's no point resisting.

Be smart and open
the gates at once.

51
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,166
So, Shaghad,
it was you all along.

You've been pulling the
strings this whole time!

[SHAGHAD]
Yes, I have.

54

For a long while now,

this city has been
mine to run as I see fit.

Then you lot came
and tried to take it over

for that fool Prince of yours.

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,166
That's simply not
something I can accept.

59
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,375
You know, that sounds an
awful lot like treason!

60

The Prince will die in battle.

It will be a noble
enough end for him.

62
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,833
Far better for him to
end his life that way

63
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,666
than as the failed ruler of
a once prosperous city.

You're nothing but
a selfish coward.

have been Lord Narsus' friend?

Narsus may think himself clever,

71
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,541
but he is a fool,
a naïve dreamer.

72
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,500
He simply can't accept that
people are inherently unequal.

If he's unable to see
something so clear,

So you knew. What was
it that tipped you off?

00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,541
The conversation we had
after we dealt with Pelagius.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,166
It's about making money.

Whoever makes the

Spoken like a

Who wouldn't have suspected
you after that speech?

Your overconfidence in your own
cunning made you careless.

You should've known better
and held your tongue.

203

[SHAGHAD]
You were such a recluse.

00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,750
I always assumed you
would stay holed up

in those mountains forever.

Why did you reappear now,
after all this time?

207
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,083
If I'm being honest, it was
something of a whim at first,

but not anymore.

209
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,041
I follow my Prince
wholeheartedly

00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,666
because I believe in his
vision for the future.

You and Daryun are
both accomplished men.

What about that boy makes
you so eager to follow him?

You've obviously
lost the ability

assuming you had
it to begin with.

216

If you cannot yet see why
we follow Prince Arslan,

But I promise you,
it's never gonna happen!

You'll die trying to

You have all the

No wonder you aren't
even willing to try!

Talking about compassion?

230
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,541
That doesn't seem like
the kind of quality

231
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,875
a military strategist
should prize.

A strategist devises plans

As important as
winning, however,

That is your punishment.

316
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,208
It's an old Parsian
proverb, I believe.

317
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,333
To pick something up,
you must put something down.

318
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,666
To gain, you must lose.

319
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,166
There was no avoiding it,

320
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,500
but to lose an old friend
is still a difficult thing.

321
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,333
[ELAM]
Lord Narsus, look.

322
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,375
[MAN A] Thank you for
seeing us, Crown Prince.

323
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,166
We citizens of Gilan are eager

324
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,500
to swear our loyalty
to Your Highness.

325
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,333
[MAN B] We are truly
grateful for the changes

326
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,750
you have brought to our city.

327
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,166
It is our hope that your
influence will soon extend...

328
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,041
And who exactly
are these people?

329
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,916
Wealthy men from the
areas surrounding Gilan.

330
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,208
One can't help but wonder

331
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,708
why they're coming out
of the woodwork now.

332
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,041
Thank you for your support.

333
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,791
I look forward to
working with you.

334
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,916
[NARRATOR] At last, Gilan was
free of its corrupt leaders

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,666
and firmly in Arslan's control.

336
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,750
[NARRATOR]
A fleet led by Gre

337
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,833
and accompanied by
Arslan's companions

338
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,833
attacked the pirates'
base of operations.

339
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,708
With Shaghad and
their captain gone,

340
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,833
the pirates were
easily rooted out.

341
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,125
The seas near Gilan were
made safe once more.

342
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,416
[ALFARáD] This banner
is for the Zot Clan?

343
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,125
Yes. We owe your
clan a great deal.

344
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,583
Without your reinforcements, we
surely would have lost the city.

345
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,125
Look at our fine banner!

346
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,541
I say.

347
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,875
From this day forward,
let us always fly this banner.

348
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,208
Let it be the symbol
of the Zot Clan.

349
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,541
And when we look up at it,

350
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,333
let us remember
that it is our duty

351
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,708
to fight against injustice
however we can!

352
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:22,750
[ZOT CLANSMEN cheering]

353
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,708
The Djinn have been
clamoring furiously.

354
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,041
Now I can see
the reason for it.

355
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,500
We seem to have
unexpected visitors.

356
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,583
[ARSLAN]
Étoile, what are you doing here?

357
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,916
[ÉTOILE]
Arslan, please.

358
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,208
I came to ask you to
send troops to Ecbatana.

359
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,375
It's King Innocentis.

360
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,958
I beg of you, help him!

361
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,041
[BOTH gasp]
