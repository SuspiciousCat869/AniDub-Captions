00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,625
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. June.

2
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,125
Taking advantage of
the war with Lusitania,

3
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,583
the country of Tkr
attacked Peshawar Fortress.

4
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,583
Arslan and his army had been
making for the Royal Capital,

5
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,208
but turned back in time to
save Peshawar from defeat.

6
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,375
Even as Arslan fought
the Tkrians,

7
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,958
shocking events were
unfolding in Ecbatana.

8
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,750
Andragoras, long a
Lusitanian prisoner,

9
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:02,208
escaped his chains, and
took Guiscard as his hostage.

10
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,958
So you plan to use me to
escape the Royal Capital?

11
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,708
What desire could
I possibly have

12
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,375
to remain here
among you savages?

13
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,166
Stand down!

14
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,750
I swear this won't be
the last you see of me.

15
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,041
When we meet again in battle,

16
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,958
it will be the Kingdom
of Pars who prevails.

17
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,375
You nuissance.

18
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,958
These loyal soldiers of yours
seem to want you back.

19
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,833
And I'm more than happy
to grant their request!

20
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,708
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER G]
Your Highness!

21
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,541
[laughing]

22
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,916
Don't worry, Ecbatana,
it won't be long.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,541
Your true ruler shall return
with an army at his back

24
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,833
to reclaim you from
those Lusitanian dogs.

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,666
[TOKHTOMYSH]
Overconfident fools.

26
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,833
What became of the
great boast you made?

27
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,750
You said you'd conquer
all of Pars

28
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,083
before the moon had
waxed and waned.

29
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,750
Yes.

30
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,458
[grumbles]

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,416
[BASMYL]
We beg your forgiveness.

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,041
I assure you,
despite our defeat,

33
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,083
our men fought bravely and well.

34
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,666
So Pars' strength is
superior to ours?

35
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,541
[ILTERISH] No! They simply
took us by surprise.

36
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,666
If we face them in
straightforward battle,

37
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,541
I think our army could
easily defeat theirs.

38
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,208
And the outlying villages?

39
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,125
Have they made for
profitable plundering?

40
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:55,875
Not quite.

41
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,958
You see, sir.

42
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,541
The villagers fled
into the fortress,

43
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,208
taking most of the
valuables along with them.

44
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,750
Then we have no choice

45
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,166
but to take the fortress itself
by whatever means necessary.

46
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,541
We won't leave until we've
won the riches we deserve,

47
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,375
even if we have to tear down
the walls of Peshawar!

48
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,833
[COMMANDERS yell]

49
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,041
[TjRNIAN SOLDIER A]
Pardon me, sir.

50
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,541
Well, what is it?

51
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
Lord Jimsa has
returned to camp

52
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,833
from the enemy fortress, sir.

53
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,666
[TOKHTOMYSH]
What?

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,500
I escaped, sir.

55
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,833
I was able to steal a horse.
I came as swiftly as I could.

56
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,208
It wasn't difficult.

57
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,083
These Parsians are a
bunch of simpletons,

58
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,541
so escape was easy.

59
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,375
Ha! What does it say about you

60
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,208
to have been captured by those
simpletons in the first place?

61
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,291
Anything to show for
your time as a captive

62
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,500
besides wounded pride?

63
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,583
[BOYRA, DIZABOULOS laugh]

64
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,583
Yes. I have some
interesting information.

65
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,416
The Parsians within the fortress
are expecting to be reinforced

66
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,166
by an ally of 10,000
outside the walls.

67
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,833
Are they indeed?

68
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,041
[JIMSA] They were going on about
how it wouldn't be long now

69
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,708
because the other force
was only 20 Farsangs away

70
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,250
to the southwest.

71
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,916
Are you certain about this?

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,666
I heard it with my own ears.

73
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,083
So again they plan to
engage us on two fronts

74
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,333
as in the last battle.

75
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,291
Cocky little bastards!

76
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,583
Ha. We'll just have
to ruin their plan.

77
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,750
Assemble the men at once!

78
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,375
Here they come.

79
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,541
[PARSIAN SOLDIER B]
It's confirmed, sir.

80
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,875
The Tkrian royal standard.

81
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,125
That King of theirs
finally showed.

82
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,166
[DARYUN]
Hmph.

83
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,083
Men of Peshawar, I am
Tokhtomysh, King of Tkr.

84
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,500
Concede defeat and
surrender your fortress!

85
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,750
If you do not, my army will turn
this field into a lake of blood.

86
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:17,791
[TjRNIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

87
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,708
[ALFARáD] They sure are a
savage bunch, aren't they?

88
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,125
I don't care for the
man's choice of words.

89
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,375
His Highness should not be
forced to listen to such drivel.

90
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,333
Well, Narsus, what next?

91
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,875
They're a nomadic people.

92
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,041
They'd have little
use for a fortress.

93
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,875
When they fight, their ultimate
goal is to pillage and plunder.

94
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,583
Well, that's
straightforward at least.

95
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,625
Tkrian bravery is well known.

96
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,750
In some ways, it could be seen
as their biggest weakness.

97
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,708
They'll fight valiantly,
but also predictably.

98
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,125
Your Highness!

99
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,291
They've dragged civilian
prisoners to the front lines!

100
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,291
What?

101
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,500
Get on your knees, you!

102
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,875
We've prepared
everything as ordered.

103
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,416
Now, Army of Pars.
Come out and face us!

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,833
If you do not,

105
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,958
then I will show you that
I don't make idle threats.

106
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,708
Now.

107
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,666
[FARMER A]
Have mercy! Please! No!

108
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,333
[ARSLAN]
That monster.

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,958
A man capable of such atrocity
is their country's ruler?

110
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:31,041
A despicable strategy.
But not a very surprising one.

111
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,166
You have become well
known as a kind man

112
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,375
who cares for his subjects.

113
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,750
Highness!

114
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,916
Daryun, wait.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,666
There are times when it's more
important to follow your heart

116
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,000
than a carefully laid plan.

117
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,583
Some decisions he must make.

118
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,250
And now he must choose

119
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,375
what being a just ruler
to his people means.

120
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,208
Let him go. This is
just one more obstacle.

121
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,166
We will find a way
to overcome it,

122
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,333
as we have all those that
we have faced before.

123

[PARSIAN GUARD B]

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,166
I see you've come
out of hiding, then?

[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
Your Highness!

Please stay back from there!

127

Tokhtomysh of Tkr.
I know your kind.

128
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,458
Cruel fiends like you can
never be reasoned with.

129
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,416
Slaughtering unarmed farmers;
a shameful, cowardly act.

130
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,625
You're no King.

131
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,250
No one who would do such
deserves that title.

132
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,041
So come take it from me.

133
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,541
I'm not afraid of a little

need of a new ruler!

too far ahead, Your Highness.

these past months.

his resolve now.

Well, Narsus, you were right.

This is an obstacle we
can and will overcome.

I'm honored to learn that a man
as famed as the Knight in Black

162
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
knows my name.

163
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,791
I challenge you!

164
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,500
Hiyah!

165
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,541
Ha!

166
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,875
[ARSLAN]
Tokhtomysh!

167
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,958
Dismount and beg me to
spare your pitiful life.

168
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,875
Maybe I'll lock you in a cage
instead of killing you.

169
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,166
You have no shred of
humanity or decency.

170
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,083
I will never surrender!

171
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,625
[ARSLAN yells]

172
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,833
[laughs]

173
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,625
You fool!

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,666
Jaswant!

175
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,583
Highness!

176
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,208
Keep letting yourself
get distracted

177
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,125
and you won't stand a chance.

178
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:40,958
Your Highness!

179
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,083
Damn it!

180
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,541
Say your prayers.

181
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,291
The battlefield's no place
for a naïve little boy.

182
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,416
[yells]

183
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,916
[gasps]

184
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,375
Gieve, you're back!

185
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,750
Gieve!

186
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,708
Master Gieve!

187
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,208
King Tokhtomysh!

188
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625
[TOKHTOMYSH]
Get off! Who is that?

189
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,250
Gieve. I'm glad to have
you back with us!

190
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,583
I'm glad to be back, Highness.

191
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,916
I hope you aren't upset
with me for interfering.

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,041
I just happened to arrive
at the right moment.

193
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,208
[chuckles]

194
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,458
Always the minstrel.

195
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,666
He was most likely waiting

196
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,125
to make the perfect
dramatic entrance.

197
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,083
Somehow I always
seem to find myself

198
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,750
at the center of attention.

199
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,708
Such a destiny can be
a burden at times,

200
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,625
but I do my best to
accept it graciously.

201
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,458
So, archer, you are
known as Gieve?

202
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,666
That is the name I allow
my friends to use.

203
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,250
It won't do for you however.

204
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,541
You may call me Bringer
of Peace and Justice.

205
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,000
That's ridiculous.

206
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,541
[GIEVE]
Don't care for that title?

207
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,958
Don't worry, I have
another if you'd prefer.

208
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,958
Lover of Beautiful Women,
Killer of Ugly Men.

209
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,250
[growls] Kill him!

210
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,708
[ARSLAN]
Farangis! Narsus!

211
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,708
Your Highness!

212
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,083
Daryun!

213
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,291
So, wise King of Tkr,

214
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,750
about those two flying columns
you so eagerly sent out,

215
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,708
I hope you weren't expecting
to see many of them again.

216
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,291
What are you saying?

217
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,500
[NARSUS] You might try putting
cunning over bravery sometime.

218
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,166
You won't be as likely to act
on false information that way.

219
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,208
[NARRATOR] In the darkness,
swords clashed against swords.

220
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,250
The Tkrians fought
without mercy,

221
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,958
letting the thrill of battle
overtake them.

222
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,375
And so, they
slaughtered their own,

223
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,208
not knowing this had been
Narsus's plan all along.

224
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,166
Impossible! What have we done?

225
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,458
Parsians... This was
their evil plot!

226
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,208
Your men were so
filled with hate

227
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,041
they never questioned
who they were attacking,

228
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,625
even in darkness.

229
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,791
Child's play.

230
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,041
Jimsa let himself believe
the words he wanted to hear.

231
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,541
Stupid fool.

232
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,166
No, the greatest
error was yours.

233
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,000
You were the one who
chose to thin the ranks

234
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,000
of your main force.

235
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,500
Enough talk.
Kill them all, men!

236
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,250
We win again!

237
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,333
There's no one who
can outwit my Narsus.

238
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,875
Did Jimsa and Boyra's columns
really destroy each other?

239
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,875
Is this Narsus some
kind of demon?

240
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,416
[ILTERISH] We won't simply give
up because we fell into a trap.

241
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,125
If we do that,
we're as good as dead.

242
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,375
We can prevail,
warriors of Tkr.

243
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,416
Hear me, men!
This is life and death!

244
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,708
[DIZABOULOS yells]

245
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,833
Oh, just give up already!

246
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,916
Damn you!

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,333
You won't defeat Tkr,
Conqueror of the Plains!

248
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,625
[yells]

249
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,583
[TARKHAN] Your Majesty, please!
We can't win this battle.

250
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,958
We should fall back!

251
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
The Knight in Black!

252
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,875
I am Tarkhan.
Do you dare face me?

253
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,333
I accept your challenge.

254
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,333
I'll deal with him, Majesty.

255
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,125
Charge!

256
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,541
Forward!

257
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,958
[yelling]

258
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
A masterful blow.

259
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,208
[TOKHTOMYSH]
Fall back!

260
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:09,250
[drumming]

261
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,291
He's sounding the retreat?

262
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,250
The battle belongs to us!

263
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:24,208
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

264
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,333
Your Highness, I did
not share my plan.

265
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,958
I hope you will forgive me.

266
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,541
I know why you didn't.

267
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
And I also think you anticipated

268
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,375
that I would charge
the Tkrians tonight.

269
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,500
Yes. By doing so,
you ensured our victory.

270
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,375
Please.

271
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,375
Lord Narsus speaks the truth.

272
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,541
You were magnificent.

273
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,375
Brave and unflinching,
Your Highness.

274
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,666
I was a pawn. A fool
used by the Parsians.

275
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,000
[NARRATOR] Thus with Tkr's
self-inflicted wounds,

276
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,083
and its main force's retreat,

277
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,333
the battle for Peshawar
came to an end.

278
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,791
My Lord cousin?

279
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,458
He was looking for the treasured
sword Rukhnabad too?

280
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,958
[GIEVE]
Yes.

281
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,875
That is not the end
of it however.

282
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,083
Some Temple Knights arrived

283
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,083
just as I'd won the
sword from Silver Mask.

284
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,000
They then took it from me,
and I was unable to retrieve it.

285
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,791
The Temple Knights
have the sword.

286
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,375
Anyway, at least you
made it back safely.

287
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,333
Thank you for taking
on such a mission.

288
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,833
Thanks are unnecessary.

289
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,958
To be honest, I was glad
for the opportunity

290
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,458
to briefly escape the
chaos of the battlefield.

291
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,250
The stench and noise
can be quite wearying.

292
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,583
However, I would like to know.

293
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,166
Who exactly is that
hulking lump of a man?

294
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,916
The one brazenly seated
so near Mistress Farangis?

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Ah. One of our officers,
Marzb Kubard.

296
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,875
He joined us at the Battle for
the Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

297
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,208
[GIEVE]
Hmm...

298
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,750
Dear Mistress Farangis,

299
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,458
I know that my long absence
must have grieved you terribly

300
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,125
and left your days
empty of meaning.

301
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,750
But no matter how
deeply you pine,

302
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,958
you must not keep company
with a rogue like this

303
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,250
and risk lasting damage
to your honor.

304
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,583
You truly believe my life
has been meaningless

305
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,375
simply because you
have been gone?

306
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,625
[GIEVE]
In all the time we have...

307
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,000
Hilmes and the Temple
Knights are after it.

308
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,458
What do you think?

309
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,458
Well, Prince Hilmes is very
likely growing impatient.

310
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,166
He probably thinks
finding the sword

311
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,416
will guarantee him the throne.

312
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,875
[banging]

313
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,250
[TOKHTOMYSH]
Stop! What are you doing?

314
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,208
--[thud]
--[TOKHTOMYSH groans]

315
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,416
I don't understand.
Why, Ilterish? Why would you?

316
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,583
First you retreat. Now you
want to parley with them?

317
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,375
No true man of Tkr
would do such a thing.

318
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,708
Your pathetic cowardice
dishonors our dead brothers.

319
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,916
Goodbye, former king

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,666
[TOKHTOMYSH yells]

321
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,875
It had to be done.

322
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,458
Tokhtomysh did not
deserve to be our King.

323
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,666
If any of you object,
come forward!

324
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,666
[ARSLAN] Everyone,
you fought well and bravely.

325
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,833
With the fortress secure,

326
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,833
we can march for the
royal capital again.

327
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,333
But there is someone
I would like to honor.

328
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,000
Tks, please.

329
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,250
But I didn't lead a charge
in this battle, Highness.

330
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,833
I wasn't even at the front.

331
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,500
You had a greater role.

332
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,000
You and your men were tasked

333
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,250
with creating evidence to
suggest the passage of an army.

334
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,333
You made the enemy believe in
a force that never existed.

335
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,041
And thanks to that,
we won this day.

336
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,291
We owe our victory to you.

337
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,416
Sir, I am only happy
to do my duty.

338
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,333
Nice.

339
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,041
[KISHWARD grunts]

340
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,250
His magnanimity and insight
never cease to amaze me.

341
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,291
He praises those whose work
would otherwise go unnoticed.

342
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,250
And by doing so
inspires all his men.

343
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,333
That shows the wisdom
of a good ruler.

344
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,791
You know, Daryun,

345
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,416
I've noticed something when
it comes to His Highness.

346
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,333
There's not a thing that
doesn't impress you.

347
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,000
Is that strange?

348
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,166
No.

349
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIER F]
A report, sir!

350
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,416
Yes, what is it?

351
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,333
A carriage! There's a carriage
heading this way now.

352
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,791
Bearing His Majesty!

353
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,958
[gasps]

354
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,875
[ARSLAN] Lord Father,
I am very glad to see you safe.

355
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,208
Since we parted at Atropatene,

356
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,333
I have been concerned
for your well-being.

357
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,916
Incredible.

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,666
I never imagined the King would
be able to escape without help.

359
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,583
I had wondered if something
might be going on

360
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,916
in the Royal Capital.

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,708
But I never thought--

362
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,625
And my Lady Mother?
I hope she is in--

363
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,125
[ANDRAGORAS] In Pars,
only one man has the right

364
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,791
to lead an army
and that is the King.

365
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,666
For another to gather such
a force and ride at its head

366
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,083
is nothing short
of high treason.

367
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,416
This is something any
Prince should know.

368
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I trust you're aware?

369
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,291
Yes, Majesty.

370
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,791
[DARYUN]
Due respect, Your Majesty.

371
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,416
You yourself made His Highness
the Crown Prince.

372
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,791
He has only been
fulfilling his duty.

373
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:25,958
In the King's absence,

374
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,083
surely the Prince
should act as his proxy.

375
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,333
I don't see how His Highness
is guilty of any crime.

376
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,916
Lord Daryun,

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,708
you are being insolent to His
Majesty, your rightful King!

378
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,083
Hold your tongue!

379
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,375
Yes, sir.

380
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,500
Arslan, hear my orders well.

381
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,041
I require more men
to retake Pars.

382
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,583
You will go and
assemble them for me.

383
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,708
And don't bother showing
your face here again

384
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:58,375
until you've amassed a
force of at least 50,000.

385
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:02,166
[DARYUN] That is effectively
being sent into exile.

386
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,958
Your Highness.

387
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,333
[NARRATOR]
King Andragoras had returned

388
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,375
and now yet another obstacle
stood between Arslan

389
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,500
and the realization
of his dreams.

390
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,916
Next time, "Journey Horse,
Sad and Solitary."

391
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,791
And thus, would the
boy become King.
