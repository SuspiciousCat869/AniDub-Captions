00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,083
[NARRATOR]
In the port city of Gilan,

2
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,791
Narsus was reunited with
his old friend, Shaghad.

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,625
Arslan and his
companions learned

4
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,833
that Gilan's ships were
being threatened by pirates.

5
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,791
In hopes of demonstrating
their strength

6
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,750
and earning the
city's good will,

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,791
they foiled an attack
on a merchant vessel.

8
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,791
[GRZE]
We might've been done for

9
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,125
if it wasn't for you
folks showin' up.

10
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,375
You guys really saved our bacon.

11
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,791
You know, when we
sailed into port,

12
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,541
I never expected I'd find the
famous Marzb Daryun

13
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,375
visiting our fair city.

14
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,625
[DARYUN]
We understand those pirates

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,916
have been making trouble
pretty frequently.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,083
[GRZE]
Yeah.

17
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,291
Or so I've heard.

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,750
We're just getting back
from a run to Serica

19
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,708
so we haven't had to tangle
with them before now.

20
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,125
Aye. We've gotten
reports about it.

21
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,041
Merchant ships goin'
in and out of this port

22
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,750
are gettin' hit hard.

23
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,833
[DARYUN]
Mm.

24
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,416
So it's true after all.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,708
And here I thought that idiot
Viceroy was just making it up

26
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,166
As did I. I'm still not
convinced he told the truth.

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,625
[GRZE]
Now, then!

28
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,250
What do you say we go in search
of a good, stiff drink?

29
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,833
It's not a lot by way of thanks,

30
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,541
but I would like to treat you
all to a round at least.

31
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,625
Come on, I know a good tavern.

32
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,083
The pirates are gone.

33
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,541
Good work, Daryun. Thank you.
The rest of you too.

34
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,791
And this is?

35
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,458
he Crown Prince of
the Kingdom of Pars.

36
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,625
His Highness, Prince Arslan.

37
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,708
[GRZE]
Huh?

38
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,000
[GRZE, CREWMEN]
What?!

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,208
[GIEVE]
You heard right!

40
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,083
The great Mard fu Mard,
Lord Daryun!

41
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,291
Pit your strength against his
in the ultimate test of arms...

42
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,000
[GRZE]
You're serious?

43
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,500
I've been at sea
for a long time,

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,541
so I hadn't heard anything
about the Lusitanian invasion.

45
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,916
[GRZE]
It's good news and all

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,916
that King Andragoras
has returned alive.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,333
But ordering you to
assemble 50,000 men?

48
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,791
Pardon, Your Highness,

49
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,375
but that sounds more than a
little unreasonable to me.

50
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,500
What we'd like to do
is mobilize the soldiers

51
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,250
stationed here in Gilan.

52
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,791
We've filed a request to that
effect with the Viceroy.

53
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,625
We had hoped that you
and the other merchants

54
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,333
might help by raising the funds
to cover the cost of this army.

55
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,750
[GRZE]
Hmm.

56
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,916
Feeding and arming
a force of 50,000 men

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,583
is going to require
a pretty hefty amount of coin.

58
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,208
I know that what we're
asking won't be easy,

59
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,500
but I have no choice.

60
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,750
I have to complete the
mission I've been given.

61
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,291
So I humbly ask you.

62
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,500
Please help us raise
the funds that we need.

63
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,000
[GRZE]
Whoa, now!

64
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,791
There's no need to humble
yourself for me, Your Highness.

65
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,791
You and your friends saved
my ship from those scum,

66
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,333
not to mention my life.

67
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,250
My crew and I'd all be
dead if not for you,

68
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,500
and that deserves more
than a round of drinks.

69
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,791
[NARSUS]
Then you're agreeing to help us?

70
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,750
Yeah, and I'll have
a little chat

71
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,375
with the other merchants too.

72
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,708
Don't worry, Highness,

73
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,291
with me as your financial
backer, you'll be fine.

74
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,000
[ARSLAN] How are you
going to raise so much?

75
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,375
We'll take care of
everything, you'll see.

76
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,708
Isn't that right, men?

77
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,208
[CREWMEN]
Aye!

78
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,666
I became a sailor because I
liked travel and adventure,

79
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,125
not because I wanted to
get rich as a merchant.

80
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,583
If the money I've made can
be used to help my kingdom,

81
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,708
well that's a lot better than
hoarding it away on land.

82
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,583
You mean that. Thanks, Gre.

83
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,625
Looks like things are
shaping up pretty well.

84
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,500
Except we still have Viceroy
Pelagius to deal with.

85
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,458
We didn't get to finish
our talk with him before,

86
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,583
but I don't know how much
that really matters.

87
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,916
Even if he did agree to help us,

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,916
I don't think we
could trust him.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,166
True.

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,666
The man's a self-centered fool

91
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,750
who cares more for
money than his people.

92
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,916
He's not fit to govern the city.

93
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,333
[ARSLAN] Narsus, you have some
thoughts on the matter?

94
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,875
Always, Highness.

95
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,000
I think I have a plan
that may work.

96
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:07,625
Farangis, Jaswant, the two of
you will have starring roles.

97
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh?

98
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,833
[NARSUS]
Gieve, I'll need your help too.

99
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,250
And that leaves...

100
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,000
[GRZE]
Huh?

101
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,708
[NARSUS]
...Master Gre.

102
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,083
You and your crew returned from
Serica today, is that correct?

103
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,125
Yeah.

104
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,333
And thanks to you people,

105
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,875
most of my cargo made
it here safely too.

106
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,166
[NARSUS]
In that case,

107
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,500
would you mind if we put
you to work right away?

108
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,125
[PELAGIUS]
You!

109
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,375
[COURTIER A]
Yes, Master. How can I help?

110
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,750
[PELAGIUS] Take these
scrolls to the hidden room.

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,708
And be certain
that nobody knows

112
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,166
where you're going or
what you're doing.

113
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,958
[PELAGIUS] As long as they
don't find those records,

114
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,875
they won't know what's
become of the tribute money,

115
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,916
and I should be able to cover
my trail easily enough.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,708
The royals can handle
their own problems.

117
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,250
Why should I be responsible

118
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,750
for cleaning up the
mess they've made?

119
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,083
I've worked hard to see this
city become prosperous.

120
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,541
Its riches will be mine.

121
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,125
[CIVIL SERVANT A]
Your Excellency!

122
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,583
Yes, what is it?

123
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,750
[CIVIL SERVANT A]
The trader, Master Gre,

124
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,583
is here to see you.

125
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,125
[PELAGIUS]
Let him through.

126
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,125
My apologies for not coming

127
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,458
to see you sooner,
Viceroy Pelagius.

128
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,000
[PELAGIUS]
Come in, Gre.

129
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,958
I hear you had a less
than cordial welcome

130
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,958
upon your return from Serica.

131
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,875
Attacked by those damn pirates.

132
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,208
Fortunately, most of the
cargo made it through.

133
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't know what
we would have done

134
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,375
if it hadn't been for
those guests of yours.

135
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,250
[PELAGIUS]
Mhm?

136
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,875
Ah. Yes, of course.

137
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,083
They saved us.

138
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,791
And to thank you for
sending them to our aid,

139
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,125
I have a little souvenir
from the Kingdom of Silk.

140
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,333
A souvenir, you say?

141
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,291
[GRZE] She is eager
to be placed in the care

142
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,875
of a strong, powerful
man like yourself.

143
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,458
A fine creature, is she not?

144
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,000
Very well, then. Let's see
what she has to offer.

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,500
[FARANGIS] Oh, no!
Your goblet is empty already.

146
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:25,083
We can't have that! Please,
may I pour you another glass?

147
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,541
[PELAGIUS chuckles]

148
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,083
I'm impressed.

149
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,583
I've never met a woman who could
keep up with me cup for cup.

150
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,875
In Serica, a woman isn't
considered accomplished

151
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,875
unless she can keep her
head while drinking.

152
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,041
You there, pageboy.

153
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,333
What? Pageboy?

154
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,833
Don't just stand there.

155
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,875
Make yourself useful.
Fan my Lord Pelagius.

156
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,875
Yes. Of course.

157
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,583
You're right.
That does feel nice.

158
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,500
[FARANGIS giggles]

159
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,250
I like you even more now.

160
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,458
You mustn't, my Lord.
We only just met!

161
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,791
Now don't be shy.

162
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,791
I promise I'll take good
care of a beauty like you.

163
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,458
I'll give you a life such as
you've never dreamed of.

164
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,958
[FARANGIS] Oh, will you?
Come, have another drink.

165
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,375
I guess even a fool
like him is smart enough

166
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,458
to keep incriminating
evidence well hidden.

167
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,875
[door opens]

168
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,333
[gasps]

169
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,416
[GIEVE]
Pardon the late night intrusion.

170
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,750
My lady.

171
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,000
A thief? What do you want?

172
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,416
[GIEVE] Don't toy with me.
You're too cruel.

173
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,875
I think we both know
you are the thief here.

174
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,375
Wha--?

175
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,958
You may look innocent, but
you're a guilty woman indeed.

176
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,708
With one look you stole
my heart away.

177
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh.

178
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,083
This city is practically
drowning in wealth.

179
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,750
And it's mine to do as I wish!

180
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,833
With everything else going on in
the kingdom, no one will notice.

181
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,375
Oh?

182
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,041
King Andragoras was supposed
to be so fierce and courageous,

183
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,083
but look how easily he fell!

184
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,708
And his heir, Prince Arslan,

185
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,750
is about as intimidating
as a housecat,

186
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,041
and as intelligent as one.

187
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,375
If you ask me, the Kingdom
of Pars has no future.

188
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,041
Oh! I have an idea!
Come away with me.

189
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,750
We'll take my fortune and sail
together to some far-off land.

190
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:36,125
Or, if you prefer, we could
even go back to Serica.

191
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,583
What do you say?

192
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,875
Why don't you and I run away

193
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,375
and spend our lives
indulging our every whim?

194
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,666
[FARANGIS] I can't think
of anything I'd like less.

195
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,833
Huh?

196
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,375
[PELAGIUS] Your Royal Highness,
I don't understand!

197
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,541
What is the meaning
of this outrage?

198
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,166
Please tell me what it is
I'm supposed to have done.

199
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,583
I'm entirely innocent!
I promise you!

200
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,958
Wait, I know!

201
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,958
That woman from Serica
and her attendant

202
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,166
must have plotted this!

203
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,958
Honestly, you truly
don't see it?

204
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,625
I guess it doesn't take much
to blind a man like you.

205
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,750
Huh?

206
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,416
Betraying the trust
of your liege Lord

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
is a most shameful act.

208
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,416
Death is too good for you.

209
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,041
[PELAGIUS] Please,
Your Highness. I was drunk.

210
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,458
It was a jest, that's all!

211
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,833
Don't waste our time and
yours feigning innocence.

212
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,291
[JASWANT]
You've been caught.

213
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,416
We heard all we needed
to hear and more.

214
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,166
Your disrespect of Crown
Prince Arslan and of Pars.

215
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,250
Your intent to betray your King.

216
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,541
You took advantage
of wartime confusion,

217
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,291
keeping all the taxes you
collected for yourself.

218
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,916
You will hand them
over immediately.

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,125
Do you have any proof
of this misdeed?

220
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,958
What evidence is there to
suggest I embezzled this money?

221
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,000
[GIEVE]
It's proof you want?

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Something like this, you mean?

223
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
Impossible. Where
did you get that?

224
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,875
[GIEVE] I happened
to meet the young lady

225
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,416
who handles your records.

226
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,125
She was kind enough to let me
borrow these for a bit.

227
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,458
What was that useless
woman thinking?

228
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,333
I told her to make sure that
nobody knew what she was doing.

229
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,750
You are unquestionably guilty

230
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,041
of violating Sage
King Jamshid's law.

231
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,208
Your wickedness shall be judged.

232
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,958
You are a small, petty man,

233
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,166
but that doesn't diminish
the gravity of your crime.

234
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,125
Viceroy of Gilan, Pelagius.

235
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,625
You took advantage of the
confusion in the Royal Capital

236
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,125
to enrich yourself.

237
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,958
I have been given solid
proof of your guilt.

238
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,250
And so, I hereby dismiss you
from your post as Viceroy.

239
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,458
[NARRATOR]
As dawn broke the following day,

240
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,958
Pelagius's dismissal and
banishment from the city

241
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,875
was made known to all of Gilan.

242
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,166
A new Viceroy needed
to be chosen,

243
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,791
but until that could be done,

244
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,333
Prince Arslan assumed
provisional rule of the city.

245
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,625
[ELAM]
Returning 200,000 silver pieces

246
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,291
to the people of the city?

247
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,000
That is generous.

248
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,791
[NARSUS] A grand gesture,
but a necessary one.

249
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,291
We will show them
that Prince Arslan

250
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,208
is very different from Pelagius.

251
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,708
That will be the first step
toward gaining their trust.

252
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,291
It seems like a good idea.

253
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,000
If we can get the
city to trust us,

254
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,000
maybe we can
get it to help us.

255
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,041
[SHAGHAD]
I don't know about that.

256
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,875
Honestly, how much good
can it possibly do

257
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,916
to ingratiate yourself to
poor folks like these?

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,041
Gilan is the city it is
because of us merchants.

259
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,625
We are its lifeblood.

260
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,333
[NARSUS]
I don't dispute that.

261
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,875
But we can only turn a blind eye

262
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,541
to rampant inequality
for so long.

263
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,833
[SHAGHAD chuckles]

264
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,208
Listen to you.

265
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,458
I never thought I would hear
such idealistic drivel

266
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,708
coming out of your
mouth, Narsus.

267
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,041
It seems like we've traded
places since the old days.

268
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,833
Maybe so.

269
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,166
You were always quick

270
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,416
to speak about your dreams
and ideals back then.

271
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,875
And I always responded with
skepticism and discouragement.

272
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,500
But enough of that.
We're not through here.

273
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,791
Oh?

274
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,250
We still need to decide
what we're going to do

275
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,791
about these pirates.

276
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,416
Yes. What are the Master
Strategist's thoughts?

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,916
When I analyzed the records
of their past attacks,

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,833
I noticed something interesting.

279
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,500
It was the ships' cargoes.

280
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,083
The pirates always
seem to appear

281
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,250
when there are vessels
coming or going from port

282
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
carrying valuable goods,

283
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,416
almost as if they know
what they're looking for.

284
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,541
What are you suggesting?

285
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,041
Do you mean there's
somebody in the city

286
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,083
who's passing information
to the pirates?

287
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,250
That is the best explanation.

288
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,958
That sounds risky.

289
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,000
It would be a difficult thing
to do without getting caught.

290
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes, if someone like that
did actually exist,

291
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,916
he'd have to be quite
a skilled tactician.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,083
I'll have to disagree with you.

293
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
Greedy is the word
that comes to mind.

294
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,750
It's simple.

295
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,000
For somebody to gain wealth,
somebody else must lose it.

296
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,958
That isn't greed,
it's the way of the world.

297
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,875
This person pits men
against one another

298
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,416
while he hides in the shadows,

299
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,875
happily reaping the rewards
of the violence he instigates.

300
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,625
I wouldn't call such a
person a skilled tactician,

301
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,791
but rather an immoral cheat.

302
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
Wake up. Business isn't
about morality.

303
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,708
It isn't about playing fair.

304
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,250
It's about making money. Whoever
makes the most is the victor.

305
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,708
In a port city like this one,
that's all that matters.

306
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,416
The victor? Like a game?

307
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
These are people's lives
we're talking about.

308
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,083
How did the man I once knew
become so heartless and corrupt?

309
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,875
I am disappointed, Narsus.

310
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,250
When you say such things,
you sound like a naïve boy.

311
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,958
I thought you were
smarter than that.

312
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,750
Seems I'm not the only
one who's changed.

313
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
I thought we came here for
help from an old friend,

314
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,541
but that man is gone.

315
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm sorry, Lord Narsus.

316
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,458
Funny. Believe it or not, Elam,

317
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,041
there was actually a time
when I thought about

318
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,625
placing you in his care.

319
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,625
I lived the life of a recluse.

320
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,583
As a merchant, he was a
member of regular society.

321
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,791
I thought you'd be
happier with him.

322
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,333
However, now
I am sincerely glad

323
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,666
that I decided to
keep you with me.

324
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,333
I'm glad, too.

325
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,583
Let's get going.

326
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,750
We still have much work to do.
We can't stand around here.

327
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,916
[ELAM]
Yes, sir.

328
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,916
[VILLAGER A]
It's them! It's the pirates!

329
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,833
[PIRATE CAPTAIN laughing]

330
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,166
Just look at them run,
pathetic wretches.

331
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,416
I'm sorry, Captain.

332
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
But you know, our contact said

333
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,583
we'd be better off
layin' low for a while.

334
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,125
To show up with a whole
fleet like this-- Ah!

335
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,500
I don't give a damn
about what he says.

336
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,291
He's not one of us, is he?

337
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,916
You think I'm gonna take orders
from a land-loving outsider?

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,833
Today we'll teach the good
people of Gilan a lesson.

339
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,375
After that, they won't be so
eager to fight back anymore

340
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,666
But, sir, what if they have help
from those same people again?

341
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,500
However strong they might be,
there's only a handful of 'em.

342
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,500
We can take them easily enough.

343
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,916
How long do you
think they'll last

344
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,291
in a surprise attack
against this many ships?

345
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,125
I hope the bastards do
show so I can kill 'em.

346
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,541
[PIRATE B]
Captain!

347
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,000
Something isn't right.

348
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,208
[PIRATE CAPTAIN]
What's wrong?

349
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,541
The tidal current's
changed somehow.

350
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,708
The ships are being pushed
further and further off course.

351
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,958
[PIRATE CAPTAIN]
What?

352
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,958
[NARSUS]
Just as we thought.

353
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,541
[ELAM] The pirates
were successful in part

354
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,375
because they have a thorough
knowledge of these waters

355
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,333
and their tidal currents.

356
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,708
Yeah, that makes sense.

357
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,291
If they also had information
on the ships' cargoes,

358
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,500
then it's no wonder
they were so efficient.

359
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
Indeed.

360
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,000
And knowing that,

361
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,500
we can use their own
knowledge against them.

362
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,375
I doubt they'll be able
to correct course

363
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,416
with such a drastic
change in the current.

364
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,666
[GIEVE] Well, Lord Narsus,
is it our turn now?

365
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,625
Yes. Give the order.

366
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,291
Right! You heard him!

367
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,083
[SOLDIERS, CREWMAN cheer]

368
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,500
[ALL]
And heave!

369
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,500
Light them up, men.

370
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,541
[PIRATE CAPTAIN]
You idiots!

371
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,208
Hurry and get those fires out!

372
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, sir. But there's
so many of-- Uh!

373
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,708
What is it now?

374
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,583
[GRZE]
Listen up, you dogs!

375
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,791
That was quite a welcome

376
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,166
you and your friends
gave us the other day.

377
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,916
Now we'd like to
return the favor.

378
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,541
[ALL yelling]

379
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,833
[ALFARáD] The pirates
brought quite a few ships.

380
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,833
About 20, by my count.

381
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,000
That's no small number.
Will they be all right?

382
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,541
[NARSUS] I wouldn't worry
too much, Your Highness.

383
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,375
This is their home port.

384
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:26,166
There's nobody better
suited to defend it.

385
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,666
They'll be fine.

386
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,791
[yelling]

387
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,541
He's here.

388
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,208
[yelling]

389
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,416
[MALE PIRATE F]
Captain!

390
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,750
I can see it was a mistake

391
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,666
to show your friends mercy
the last time we fought.

392
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,000
And I try not to
repeat my mistakes.

393
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,916
No one goes free today.

394
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,958
No!

395
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,583
Well, you fools, don't just
stand there! Go kill him!

396
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,583
Surround him! He's just one man!

397
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,750
[PIRATE P]
Die!

398
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,208
What d'ya think? My ship handles
like a dream, doesn't she?

399
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,541
Yes. How about a more
relaxed ride next time?

400
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,833
Sure, but we should probably
take care of these guys first.

401
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,916
True.

402
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:06,208
[NARSUS] Huh, there aren't many
Daryun trusts to guard his back.

403
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,250
Highness, may I make
a suggestion?

404
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,750
When things have settled down,

405
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,333
I believe that Gre would make
a fine Viceroy for Gilan.

406
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
Yes. I agree.

407
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,791
You know, things will change
here. For the better.

408
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,000
Today is the first step.

409
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,750
[DARYUN]
The fight's over. You've lost.

410
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,916
Gilan is under our protection.

411
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,875
From now on, piracy will not be
tolerated in these waters.

412
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,916
[NARRATOR]
And so the battle ended.

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,166
Fighting together, Gre
and Daryun won victory

414
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,833
for the people of Gilan.

415
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,083
And all the surviving
pirates were captured.

416
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,833
Oh, it's you.
I'm sorry about this.

417
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,125
I shouldn't have
launched that attack

418
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,708
without talking to you first.

419
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,916
I can see that now.

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,625
We pirates have our
own sense of honor,

421
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,166
and I felt like I had to strike.

422
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,000
[yelps]

423
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,916
It was stupid. I'm sorry!

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Please! I'll do anything
you want. Anything!

425
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,541
So then you are the one

426
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,083
who orchestrated His
Majesty's assassination.

427
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,000
[ÉTOILE]
What are saying?

428
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,208
I would never do
something like--

429
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,375
I swear, it wasn't me!
Please, listen!

430
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,291
Prince Guiscard, come back!
It wasn't me!

431
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:36,000
[GUISCARD] Excellent. Everything
should now be in place.
