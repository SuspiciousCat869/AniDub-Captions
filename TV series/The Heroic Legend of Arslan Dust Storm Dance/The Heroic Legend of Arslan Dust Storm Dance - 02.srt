[HILMES]
My name is Hilmes.

2
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,083
My father's name was Osroes.

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:45,083
I am the rightful King of Pars.
The throne will be mine.

4
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,125
[SORCERER A]
You did what?

5
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,583
And here I'd been
under the impression

6
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,458
you were a responsible,
intelligent man.

7
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,916
My mistake.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,375
[HILMES]
Say what you will,

9
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,250
I don't think revealing
my identity was a mistake.

10
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,416
[SORCERER A]
You do like to push your luck.

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,458
You crossed swords with
Arslan and his underlings

12
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,541
at the Keep of Saint Emmanuel,
and yet the Prince still lives.

[HILMES]
When I finally defeat him,

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,041
I want it to be both
thorough and painful.

15
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,541
And for that, I need your help.

16
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,250
[SORCERER A]
Hmm...

17
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,458
The legendary sword Rukhnabad.

18
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,583
[HILMES] The sword of the
Hero King Kaykhusraw.

19
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,125
The stories say it was forged
from a piece of the sun.

20
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,125
Does it truly exist?

21
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,458
[SORCERER A]
A gift from the gods.

22
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,458
There's no greater symbol
of a man's right to rule.

23
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,375
Tell me where I can find it!

24
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,708
[SORCERER A] If you're truly
the descendant of the Hero King,

25
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,458
you should be able
to wield his sword.

26
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,625
But do not attempt that lightly.

27
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,000
I can wield it.

28
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,458
Once the sword is in my hands,

29
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,083
I'll give you all the
proof you could want.

[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
Stay strong!

32
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,833
Peshawar Fortress is famed
for its impregnability,

33
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,208
but that ends today
with our conquest.

[TjRNIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

They know that we're undermanned
because of the Lusitanian war.

37
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,166
Opportunistic savages.

38
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,208
These cowards cringe
behind their walls

39
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,875
because they lost their
capital to savages.

40

Show no mercy. Put the

That I am!

I am Jinong Eelt'rish of Tkr.

Many of my countrymen
have fallen to your sword

throughout the years.

I'm looking forward
to making you pay!

I don't know who you are,

but whatever grudge you
may have against me,

I will not let
you win this day.

I still have far
too much left to do.

62
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,791
Tkr saw that their
neighbor was weak

63
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
so they launched
an unjust war.

64
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,125
Time to show these pathetic
cowards their mistake!

65

Am I the only one who finds
this situation really annoying?

We're right back where
we started from!

Knowing Peshawar was
going to be attacked,

00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,416
what else could we do
but turn around?

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes, I know, but it's still
annoying. Right, Narsus?

70
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,500
I agree it's unfortunate we
had to turn the army back.

71
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,083
However, I am glad
we made it in time.

72
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,041
This simply means Lusitania
is not our only foe.

True. Which I think you
had already predicted.

careful with your life.

That's what they call you.

Oh, is it? But perhaps
I'm some other Kubard.

We're losing this battle.

00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,875
We should return
to camp and regroup.

Fine, we'll go.

it just in time.

Yes. That we did.

103
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,541
[NARRATOR] Lusitania was
not the only country

104
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,208
to covet the rich lands of Pars.

105

the country of nomads
to the north,

attacked Peshawar Fortress.

One month before,
Arslan and his army

109
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,583
had left the fortress
for Ecbatana.

They were halfway
to their destination

when the message came and
they were forced to turn back.

The month is now June of
the year 321, Pars Era.

Crown Prince Arslan has
accomplished much,

still await him.

Thank you, Prince Arslan,

for turning back to bring
us reinforcements.

117

It's you who deserve my thanks
for holding until I returned.

118
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,666
Your Highness is too kind.

119
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,208
[ARSLAN] Peshawar stands
sentinel at our border.

120
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,875
If we were to lose
this fortress,

121
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,833
our other victories
would be hollow.

122
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,875
Even if we succeeded
in retaking the capital.

123
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,916
Highness, do we
know what became

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,666
of King Rajendra's
reinforcements?

125
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,875
Until recently,
Tkr was our ally,

126
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,541
so it's natural I would be
hesitant to fight them.

127
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,208
I did send word of their attack.

128
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,833
And now I shall
just have to pray

129
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,916
for the safety of Prince Arslan.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,583
He's probably praying
to his gods as we speak,

131
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,541
pleading that our army and
Tkr's destroy one another.

132
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,166
He is a crafty man.

133
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,666
Yes, he is.

134
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,291
And what of Tkr's army?

135
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,625
[LUCIAN]
Following their retreat,

136
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,458
they reassembled roughly
one Farsang to the west.

137
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,958
[DARYUN] So they aren't
simply returning home, then.

138
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,500
[NARSUS]
The mounted nomads of Tkr

139
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,500
place great value on bravery
and success in the battlefield.

140

Defeating them will
not be easily done.

True. But we can't
afford to stay too long.

142
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,541
We must leave for Ecbatana soon.

143
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,791
Narsus, do you have
any suggestions?

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,916
[DARYUN] This is where
you've been hiding.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,708

146
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,000
[NARSUS]
Oh?

147
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,833
[DARYUN] I hear the army
Rajendra dispatched

has finally reached the border,

149
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,041
but it seems they intend to
let matters run their course.

[NARSUS]
Hmph.

I can't say that I'm
especially surprised.

152

[DARYUN] What is it?
Something has you worried.

153
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,291
Actually, it's the lack of
something that has me worried.

154
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,333
Meaning?

155
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,583
When we pulled back,

156
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,125
the forces in Ecbatana
made no move against us.

157
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,833
That's what's bothering you?

158
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,916
They probably just assumed
it was one of your traps.

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,041
[NARSUS]
I hope that's the case.

160
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,625
Is there some reason
to think it's not?

161
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,291
My gut tells me something
else may be going on.

162
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,166
It's just a feeling, nothing
I can put a finger to yet.

163
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,250
Great.

164
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,583
Or I may be imagining it all.

165
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,416
As an artist,
I am far too sensitive

166
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,083
to be involved in
such earthly affairs.

167
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,208
I can't wait until this
is finally finished

168
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,625
and I can return to
the world of painting.

169
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,291
I doubt the world of
painting misses you much.

170
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,791
According to Lord Narsus,

171
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,583
they're not likely to launch
another attack immediately.

172
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,958
Which means that you
can relax for now.

173
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,000
[ARSLAN]
Yes. Assuming I'm able to.

174
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,583
[ELAM] You'll want to get
whatever rest you can

175
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,166
in case some crisis
does come up.

176
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,708
I know you've had
a hard time sleeping

177
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,166
since you decided to
return to Peshawar.

178
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,541
Uh. It's that obvious?

179
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,375
Only to somebody who's
paying close attention.

180
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,458
Nothing gets by you, does it?

181
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,416
Your health is very important.
We'd be lost without our Prince.

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,875
Please take care of yourself.

183
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,458
Yes. I'll try.

184
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,583
[ARSLAN]
Tell me, Elam.

185
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,125
What do you think Gieve
would do if he were here?

186
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,458
Would he distract us with a
merry song or a funny story?

187
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,583
[ELAM chuckles]

188
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,583
Perhaps he would.

189
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,333
I wonder where his travels
have taken him by now.

190
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,333
With him, there's no telling.

191
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,000
Knowing Gieve,
it's likely someplace

192
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,000
we couldn't even imagine.

193
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,291
[chuckles] I bet you're right.

194
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,125
[GIEVE] This situation
is deeply troubling.

195
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,083
I haven't seen a woman's
face in almost three days.

196
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,250
At this point if I encountered
a hideous hag,

197
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,916
I might think her a beauty.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,791
I don't think I could ever
forgive myself for that.

199
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,416
Oh? And what's this?

200
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,375
No honest folk would
ever dare to go near

201
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,833
the treacherous
Mountain of Demavant.

202
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,583
I'm only here because
it's where my mission

203
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,916
for the Prince led me.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,583
But what about you, Silver Mask?

205
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,250
[HILMES'S SOLDIER B] Lord Silver
Mask! We have found it!

206
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,916
[HILMES'S SOLDIER C]
The royal tomb of Kaykhusraw!

207
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,333
[HILMES'S SOLDIER D]
It really exists!

208
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,375
I thought it was just a legend.

209
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,458
Remember, men, we are
not tomb-raiding savages.

210
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,333
What we do is preserve the
rightful royal lineage of Pars.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,416
[ZANDEH] You will touch
nothing but the sword!

212
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,375
We will commit no act of
sacrilege against the Hero King.

213
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:01,083
O Kaykhusraw, great founder,
Hero King, and forbearer,

214
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,041
I ask that you bestow
your righteousness

215
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,916
and courage upon me,
your descendant.

216
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,583
[HILMES] So this is the
treasured sword Rukhnabad.

217
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,500
None dare question
the man who wields it.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,125
[GIEVE] Heh. I wondered
what you were up to.

219
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,500
I didn't realize you'd fallen on
such hard times, Silver Mask.

220
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,416
I would've thought looting a
grave was beneath even you.

221
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,000
The inept minstrel,

222
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,291
always barging in where
you're not wanted.

223
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,916
Have you come prepared to sing
a song mourning your own death?

224
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,791
I'd rather not defile
the royal tomb.

225
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Go now and you may live.

226
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,416
I'll stay, thanks.

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,291
I can't leave a
treasure like that

228
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,166
in the hands of somebody
who's so unworthy of it.

229
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,875
That was nobly put,
if I do say so myself.

230
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,208
That's why you're here,

231
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,916
because you know the true
nature of this sword?

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,541
[GIEVE] Traveling musicians hear
more tales than most people,

233
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,125
but even I had to wander far

234
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,916
before I learned
of its existence.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,458
Without a minstrel's gift for
ferreting out information,

236
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,041
I'm amazed you were
able to find it.

237
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,166
[HILMES]
You had your chance,

238
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,875
but it seems you do
wish to die here!

239
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,083
[GIEVE] Not at all. I've never
liked the idea of dying.

240
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,291
It sounds far too permanent.

241
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,458
[HILMES]
Ridiculous clown!

242
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,250
Give it back!

243
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,250
As far as I'm concerned,
this is just an antique.

244
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:46,125
Even so, it's an undeniable
symbol of a king's ascendency.

245
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,916
I will take this treasured
sword to Prince Arslan.

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,541
And with it, he will prove
his right to rule.

247
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,583
[HILMES]
You'll die first. Stop him!

248
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,458
[ZANDEH] That sword belongs
to the rightful king!

249
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,833
[GIEVE]
Oh! Good heavens!

250
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:06,208
Got it! Uh? What is this?!

251
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,333
Damn you!

252
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,958
[ZANDEH yells]

253
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,583
[HILMES] Get down there.
I want that sword found!

254
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,833
[HILMES' SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

255
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,541
[ZANDEH]
Bastard.

256
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,833
[GIEVE]
What is this?

257
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,083
[GIEVE]
What do you want with the sword?

258
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,291
[ZANDEH yells]

259
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,291
Easy. I don't have what
you're after anymore.

260
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,125
[HILMES] Zandeh! They're
escaping with Rukhnabad!

261
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,458
[ZANDEH]
Who are they?!

262
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:59,625
That sigil... Temple Knights.

263
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,833
They must have been
sent here by Bodin.

264
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,083
[GIEVE]
How unfortunate.

265
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,125
I wasn't expecting
so much competition.

266
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,875
With so many players
getting involved,

267
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,875
I may need to bow out
of the game for now.

268
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,333
So...

269
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,041
[NARRATOR] Days after receiving
word of the defeat

270
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,166
at the Keep of Saint Emmanuel,

271
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,750
Prince Guiscard decided
to pay his first visit

272
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,458
to King Andragoras.

273
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,833
Knowing that Silver Mask's
true name was Prince Hilmes,

274
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,625
he sought to learn more
about the man's intentions.

275
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,166
[GUISCARD]
Greetings, Andragoras.

276
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,125
We have not met before.

277
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,291
I am the younger brother
of the Emperor.

278
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,875
My name is Prince Guiscard.

279
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,208
Guiscard, eh?

280
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,083
And what does a member
of the royal family

281
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,125
of Lusitania want with me?

282
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,708
I've come because
I would like to learn

283
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
more about your nephew.

284
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,333
The son of your late brother,
the former king, Osroes.

285
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,125
He calls himself Hilmes.

286
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,500
[ANDRAGORAS]
Hilmes died a long time ago.

287
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,875
Did he?

288
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,333
If your brother's son truly
is dead, then tell me,

289
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,041
who is the man
in the silver mask

290
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,291
who orchestrated your
defeat at Atropatene?

291
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,000
[ANDRAGORAS] A man wearing
a mask mysteriously appears

292
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,875
and tells you that his
name is Prince Hilmes,

293
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,333
and you take him at his word

294
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,916
without asking any other
questions of him?

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,250
As I've said, that's
the reason I came.

296
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,750
I want to learn more about
this man and his intentions.

297
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,000
I want to understand the
history you have with him.

298
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:38,083
[laughing]

299
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,250
Iron chain fighting,

300
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,083
developed by slaves in
the Kingdom of Nabataea.

301
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,958
Are you some kind of monster?

302
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,583
If you had such strength,
why not use it before now?

303
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,250
[ANDRAGORAS]
Unlike gold, iron rots.

304
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,916
If it soaks up sweat and soup in
the same places for half a year,

305
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,333
it crumbles.

306
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,916
In time, you can tear it apart.

307
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,625
[ANDRAGORAS] This was the
chance I was waiting for.

308
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,291
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

309
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,166
You're much too valuable
a hostage for that.

310
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,458
Your life is the coin
I wil use to buy safety

311
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,166
for myself and the Queen.

312
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,208
[ANDRAGORAS laughing]

313
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,708
What's your business?

314
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,833
No one passes through without
the proper authorization.

315
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,875
I was in service to Count
Barcacion. Squire Étoile.

316
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,125
I bring the injured

317
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,500
from the battle of the
Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

318
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,375
Will you deny us entry?

319
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,458
[LUSITANIAN GUARD C]
Wait here a moment.

320
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,208
I'll confirm this at once.

321
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,500
[ÉTOILE]
Ecbatana. We're finally here.

322
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,791
[ÉTOILE] Basically,
what you're trying to say

323
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,750
is that you're abandoning us.

324
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,333
You've dragged us
with you all this way,

325
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,000
and now we're on our own.

326
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,125
I'm sorry, but I have no choice.
I have to turn back.

327
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,041
One of your most important
outposts is under attack.

328
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,458
Of course you have
to return to it.

329
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,083
[ÉTOILE]
What are you waiting for?

330
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,125
You do understand.
Thanks, Étoile.

331
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,583
Make sure you come back alive.

332
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,458
Everybody knows that
you heathens go to hell

333
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,791
when you die.

334
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,541
[ÉTOILE gasps]

335
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,125
What happened?

336
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:45,166
s this... really Ecbatana?

337
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,083
But it's a deserted ruin.

338
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,125
I am pleased to see
how well you look.

339
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,750
Tahamenay, dear wife and Queen.

340
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,416
How many years has it been
now since I stole you away?

341
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,958
And in all that time

342
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,791
you've never shown me a single
moment of love or affection.

343
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,000
You shut your heart
to the world.

344
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
And even if you wanted to,

345
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,583
you wouldn't know how
to open it again.

346
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,166
Can you blame me?

347
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,208
What more could you
possibly have expected?

348
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,041
I loved my child.

349
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,083
It is natural for a
mother to love her child.

350
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,750
Only a monstrous one would not.

351
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:43,125
I want my child! Give me back
the child you stole from me!

352
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,916
Please, I'm begging you!
Give me back my child!

353
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
[chuckles]

354
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:57,166
I'm impatient too, Azrael.

355
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,375
We must settle things here
as quickly as we can

356
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,208
and head for Ecbatana.

357
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,333
[NARRATOR] Events had taken
an unexpected turn.

358
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,583
And in the besieged
land of Pars,

359
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:12,166
the season of scorching heat
was fast approaching.

360
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,791
[NARRATOR] The Tkrians
roused Prince Arslan's anger

361
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,875
with their careless brutality.

362
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:52,000
Would he give them
cause to regret it?

363
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,958
Next time, "The Monarch
Versus the Conqueror."

364
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,916
And thus would the
boy become King.
