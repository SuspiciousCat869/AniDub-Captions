00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,583
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. June.

2
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,791
Six months earlier,

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,375
after seizing the Royal
Capital of Ecbatana,

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,041
Lusitanian forces were
drunk with victory,

5
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,666
but now, no hint of their
former glory remained.

6
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,875
The Royal Capital lay in ruins,

7
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,291
and morale among the
troops steadily declined.

8
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,250
Guiscard took advantage
of the confusion

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,125
following Andragoras's escape

10
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,625
to imprison his brother
Innocentis the Seventh,

11
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:04,333
and seize for himself the power
that he had coveted for so long.

12
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,000
However, any satisfaction
he might have felt

13
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,916
was overshadowed
by the difficulties

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,625
the Lusitanian forces now faced.

15
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,916
[SECRETARY A] Our water supplies
are dangerously low.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,333
The troops won't survive
for long without water,

17
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,500
and they certainly
won't be able to fight.

18
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,875
What do you advise
that we do, Your Highness?

19
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,500
Cut water rations.

20
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,791
[SECRETARY A] The men
won't be happy about that.

21
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,458
Yet another problem we
can lay at Bodin's feet.

22
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,791
If he hadn't destroyed
the aqueduct,

23
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,583
our supplies would be fine.

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,083
That blind fool doesn't
care what havoc he wreaks

25
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,416
as long as it means
killing heathens.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,875
We need water!

27
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,166
Push the Parsians harder.
Get that aqueduct repaired.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,541
Yes, sir. We'll do all we can.

29
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,583
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
A report for you, sir.

30
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,291
Some of the men
are getting restless.

31
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,416
They're calling for a
massacre of the Parsians.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,208
That's simply not
going to happen.

33
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,416
It was decreed
that they were not

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,083
to be killed
indiscriminately.

35
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,750
We can't go back on that now.

36
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,166
Get them out of here before
they can cause trouble.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,333
Tell them they've been chosen
to strengthen our defenses

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,041
outside the city walls.

39
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,125
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,916
Damn those fanatics.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
At least we can put them
to use as human shields.

42
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,125
[NARRATOR] Having parted
ways with Arslan's party,

43
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,916
Étoile arrived in Ecbatana
and spent every day

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,041
seeking aid for the wounded that
she had brought back with her.

45
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,666
Unfortunately, despite
all her efforts,

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,916
she found no one who
was willing to help,

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,958
and the situation began
to seem hopeless.

48
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,541
[INNOCENTIS]
Over here.

49
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,875
What is it? Who are you?

50
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,833
Surely you know who I am!

51
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,500
[gasps] It can't be!

52
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,333
Are you His Majesty the King?

53
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,916
[INNOCENTIS]
Indeed, I am.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,166
The rightful ruler of Lusitania,
and god's proxy upon this earth.

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,958
What about you, young man?

56
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm guessing you're a soldier.

57
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,416
Yes, sire.

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,875
Newly returned from the battle
at the Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

59
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,791
My name is Étoile,
Your Majesty. I am a squire.

60
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
I brought our wounded
back following the battle.

61
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,000
[INNOCENTIS] Wonderful, well
done. Most courageous of you.

62
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,666
Listen, I can see that you
are worthy of my trust.

63
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,458
There is a favor
I would ask of you.

64
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,500
I am the victim of treachery!

65
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,625
Men who serve my brother,
Prince Guiscard,

66
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,708
have imprisoned me
in this tower.

67
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,166
I cannot believe
that my brother

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,333
is aware of what
his men have done.

69
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,750
No.

70
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,083
My own flesh and blood couldn't
be responsible for this.

71
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,125
Please, will you speak with him
and tell him what has happened?

72
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,208
I am yours to command,
Your Majesty.

73
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,666
[INNOCENTIS]
Thank you, Squire Étoile.

74
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,500
Do this for me,
and I will see to it

75
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,375
that you are made a knight.

76
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,875
The guards are coming.
You must leave, quickly!

77
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,041
[ÉTOILE]
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,166
[ÉTOILE] His Majesty
is being held prisoner

79
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,291
by men who serve under
Prince Guiscard?

80
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,375
If that's the case,

81
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,958
I'll have to speak with
the Prince in person.

82
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,375
Safe journey.

83
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,666
And if you find yourself
in any trouble,

84
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,208
you might try removing the axel
on the cart's right front wheel.

85
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,625
You should find
something of use there.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,750
[ÉTOILE]
He is a heathen and a Parsian.

87
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,458
And yet he showed us
such compassion.

88
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:30,875
While those who supposedly
follow our own faith do nothing.

89
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,416
I'll use this money to see
that everyone is looked after.

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
And then...

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,125
[GUISCARD]
I didn't kill the man

92
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,458
because I thought he
might be useful later,

93
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,041
and it almost cost
me everything.

94
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,625
Never again.

95
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,875
From now on, I will eliminate
problems as soon as they arise.

96
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,916
But, fool though he may be,
he is still my brother.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,375
I don't care for the idea
of soiling my own hands

98
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,333
with his blood.

99
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,791
[MONTFERRAT]
Pardon me, sir.

100
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,916
You remember the soldiers
we sent outside the walls?

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,375
They said they have
captured somebody

102
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,625
who claims to be a
Princess of Maryam.

103
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,416
Except that Bodin
and the Temple Knights

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,666
are supposed to have burned the
royal family of Maryam to death.

105
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,125
I believe she is an imposter,

106
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
but what would you
like us to do?

107
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,083
[GUISCARD]
Actually.

108
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,416
I heard that some princesses of
the blood escaped the slaughter.

109
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,916
I will meet with her.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,541
Leave us now.

111
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,833
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS]
Sir!

112
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,166
May I ask your name?

113
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,708
Why are your eyes closed?
Are you blind?

114
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,458
Earthly light has
been lost to me,

115
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,083
but I can see all I need to

116
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,666
with the God of
Yaldabaoth as my guide.

117
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
How pious.

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,083
I hear that you are a princess
of the blood of Maryam.

119
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,708
Every day I spend on this earth,
I wish that weren't true.

120
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,583
You Lusitanians
couldn't be content

121
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,583
with simply conquering
our kingdom.

122
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,416
You had to kill its royalty,

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,166
even though you had
promised you would not.

124
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,416
You set fire to
the royal palace.

125
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,250
Somehow, I managed to escape

126
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,666
with my elder sister Militsa
and a few of our retainers.

127
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,500
We ran to a castle on the
northwestern seaboard.

128
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,708
But in the end, that castle
fell just like the palace.

129
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,125
My sister gave her life for me,

130
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,250
sacrificing herself
so I could escape.

131
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,958
So, yes, I am a Princess of
Maryam. But I wish I wasn't.

132
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,791
Because then my
family might still live!

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,666
I can see that you have
suffered most bitterly.

134
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,916
It is understandable that
you would bear ill will

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,750
toward the King of Lusitania.

136
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,375
Who are you?

137
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,416
[JOVANNA] Honestly. What good
are you as a bodyguard?

138
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,833
You didn't even bother
trying to defend us!

139
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,958
[MERLANE] Putting up a fight
against that many soldiers

140
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,708
would only have
gotten us killed,

141
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,583
and now we're positioned in
the heart of the enemy camp.

142
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,208
[JOVANNA]
How is that a good thing?

143
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,750
Just stay calm.

144
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:50,500
I will rescue the Princess.
I promise you that.

145
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,000
My dear girl. My Princess.

146
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:57,166
How will she fare among
these barbarians?

147
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,958
I suppose this is an unfortunate
turn of events for you as well.

148
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,666
I know you're searching
for your sister

149
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,416
so you can resolve the issue
of your clan's leadership.

150
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,458
That will be difficult to do
from inside a dungeon.

151
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,833
Don't worry on my account.

152
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,083
[JOVANNA] Why would you go to
such lengths for the Princess?

153
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,416
[MERLANE]
I don't know.

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,166
I just don't like the
thought of her on her own.

155
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,125
Does that mean?

156
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,375
I'm going to find the Princess
and get her out of this castle.

157
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,541
Take advantage of the commotion
to make your own escape.

158
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,375
[GUISCARD] The girl's not
lying. She is a Princess.

159
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,666
[BAUDOUIN]
You're sure?

160
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,125
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER
D] Pardon me, sir.

161
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,708
Yes, what is it?

162
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,625
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
We captured someone

163
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,125
who was sneaking
into the palace.

164
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,666
A spy or assassin?

165
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,083
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
It's rather odd, sir.

166
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,500
He's dressed as
one of our soldiers,

167
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,500
and he says he wishes to
speak to Prince Guiscard.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,166
[GUISCARD]
Well, boy,

169
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,916
my men tell me that you
sneaked into the palace

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,250
in order to speak to me.

171
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,583
You will have to say something
very interesting indeed

172
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,083
to avoid being punished
for your stupidity.

173
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,416
I didn't know what else
to do, Your Highness.

174
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Forgive me, but are you aware

175
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,250
that His Majesty is
being held prisoner?

176
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,833
[GUISCARD] And why would you say
something like that, squire?

177
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,916
Your Highness, I'm acting
on His Majesty's command.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,583
He asked me to make
sure you were informed

179
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,291
about what had happened.

180
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,500
Whatever my brother
may have told you

181
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,958
about being held
captive was not true.

182
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,375
[ÉTOILE]
I don't understand.

183
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,791
Why would His Majesty lie
about something like that?

184
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,375
It's sad to say, but I'm afraid
my brother is quite ill.

185
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
For his own safety,

186
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,958
I'm housing him in the
tower until he can recover.

187
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
[ÉTOILE]
He seemed perfectly well to me.

188
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,500
Will it allay your fears

189
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,791
if I visit my brother personally
and reassure him

190
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,083
that my men do not
mean him any harm?

191
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,291
Yes!

192
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,916
[GUISCARD] We have a Princess
hungry for revenge

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,250
and a squire whose loyalty
blinds him to all else.

194
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,125
Who knew the solution
to our problems

195
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,458
would simply fall into our laps?

196
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,208
[BAUDOUIN]
A beautiful Maryami princess

197
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,083
bribed an impressionable
young squire

198
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,500
to bring her close
enough to the King

199
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,125
that she could take his life.

200
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,250
I assume that is how the story
of his assassination will go.

201
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,875
A tidy solution, eh?

202
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,583
This should tie up a lot
of loose ends for us,

203
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,083
and we'll barely
have to do anything.

204
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,333
[ÉTOILE]
This way, sire.

205
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,833
Thank you.

206
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,916
I wasn't certain that you were
actually going to help me.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,583
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER E]
Huh?

208
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,500
What is it?

209
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,125
That's His Majesty.

210
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,416
But who is that
other man with him?

211
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,333
[INNOCENTIS]
In recognition of your service,

212
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,791
I shall formally appoint
you to be a knight.

213
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,458
We can hold the ceremony
tomorrow if you'd like.

214
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,458
That is a precious
gift you offer me.

215
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,458
But instead I would
ask Your Majesty

216
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,000
for a place where the refugees

217
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,458
from the Keep of Saint
Emmanuel might find peace.

218
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,958
[INNOCENTIS] You may ask
for whatever you like.

219
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,500
[ÉTOILE] The Prince is
waiting for you in here.

220
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,583
He says he'll clear up
this misunderstanding.

221
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,416
And if you've been mistreated,
he will beg you for forgiveness.

222
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,333
[INNOCENTIS]
Yes.

223
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,958
[ÉTOILE] I have brought
His Majesty to see you.

224
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,458
The King? Here?

225
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,666
Well, Guiscard.

226
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,750
Explain why your men have
abused me in such a manner.

227
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,291
Call if you have
need of me, Majesty.

228
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,375
Uh. Huh?

Are you truly Innocentis
the Seventh,

00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,083
Indeed, I am.

And what of you?
What's your name?

What are you doing here?
Where is my brother, Guiscard?

Thank you, God.

I won't waste the
opportunity for vengeance

you have granted me.

What's the matter?

Why are your eyes
closed like that?

For the royal family of Maryam.

His cruelty and

Quick! Alert the Prince!

00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,791
that the Maryami Princess

I'm coming!

00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,958
Does he live?

00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,333
Yes. Sir.

264
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,750
His Majesty's wound
is deep but not fatal.

265
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,583
As a larger man, the king has
a substantial layer of fat

266
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,458
that protected his vital organs.

267
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,708
I'm sure none of us is more
relieved than you, Highness.

[GUISCARD]
So much for my brilliant plan.

This is the soldier, sir.

00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,916
I saw this one leading
His Majesty away.

273
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,375
So then you were behind
the assassination attempt?

[ÉTOILE]
No! What are you saying?

I did not harm the King!

You're in Prince Hilmes's way!

316
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,875
We're through here.

317
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:40,916
[ZANDEH]
Sir!

318
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,125
What do you want with me?

319
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,916
[MERLANE]
We can talk later.

320
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,333
Why would Silver Mask come
to Princess Irina's rescue?

321
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,083
[GUISCARD]
Damn that man!

322
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,083
I knew we couldn't trust him,

323
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,875
but I hadn't expected him
to do something like this.

324
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,166
We will have no further
dealings with him.

325
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,000
I officially declare him
an enemy of Lusitania.

326
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,291
If I had to guess,

327
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,541
I'd say that they'll make
for Zabul Fortress.

328
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,625
Ride after them!

329
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
I want that treacherous
snake to die!

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,166
Yes, sir.

331
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,375
[MERLANE]
It looks like we lost 'em.

332
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,791
[ÉTOILE] Who are you?
Why did you save me?

333
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,291
[MERLANE] I hate the idea of
someone getting beheaded

334
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,041
for a crime they didn't commit.

335
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,833
Whatever the reason,
I'm alive because of you.

336
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,041
You have my thanks.

337
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,375
Oh please.

338
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,000
Something tells me you'd
've found a way to escape

339
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,083
even without my help.

340
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,041
A girl who can pass
herself off as a soldier

341
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,500
must be resourceful.

342
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,375
I guess Alfar+d isn't
the only young woman

343
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,708
going rogue these days.

344
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,958
[ÉTOILE]
Alfar+d?

345
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,833
Oh, sorry.
That's my little sister.

346
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,833
Why do you look so confused?

347
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,625
[ÉTOILE]
Is that a common name here?

348
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,750
How many girls in Pars
are called Alfar+d?

349
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,916
How would I know
something like that?

350
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,041
Though I doubt there are many

351
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,208
who are 16 years old,
have red hair,

352
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,708
and wear a light blue cloth
wrapped around their heads.

353
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,375
[ÉTOILE] Is she a fighter?
A skilled horsewoman and archer?

354
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,000
No ordinary man would stand
a chance against her.

355
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,083
[ÉTOILE] I've met her.
I know your sister!

356
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,416
You do? Can you tell
me where she is?

357
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,625
It's been a while
since I've seen her,

358
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
but she should be with Crown
Prince Arslan of Pars.

359
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,291
You're kidding.

360
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,416
I wouldn't have thought she
had enough feminine charm

361
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,083
to seduce royalty.

362
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,666
[MERLANE]
Fine.

363
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,250
Track down the Prince
and I find my sister. Uh.

364
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,416
What are you doing?

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,791
I'm coming with you.

366
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,291
And why would you do that?

367
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,625
I have no further
business with you.

368
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,791
[ÉTOILE] Nor do I have
any business with you,

369
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,208
but I do wish to
see Prince Arslan.

370
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,458
You people hate the
Parsians. Why seek him?

371
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,000
Because while he is a heathen,

372
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,083
he is also a man
who we can trust.

373
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,708
[NARRATOR]
Thus, in a single night,

374
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,750
fate took a number of turns,

375
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,166
sending more than one person
off in unexpected directions.

376
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,291
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
as these events were unfolding

377
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,708
in the Royal Captial,

378
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,291
Arslan and his party
remained in Gilan.

379
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,208
Did you say Safdie Island?

380
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,666
[DARYUN]
Yes.

381
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,291
It is a small island located
approximately ten Farsangs

382
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,333
off the coast of
the harbor here.

383
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,750
And is there something of
interest on this island?

384
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,208
Yes.

385
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,333
I've been speaking to the
pirate captain we captured,

386
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,125
and if we can believe
what he says,

387
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,083
there's a treasure of
considerable value

388
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,083
on that island.

389
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,250
Really, pirate treasure?

390
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,208
So the captain says, anyway.

391
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,208
Hidden there by the
Pirate King Ahabek.

392
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,833
He was a well-known
bandit of the seas

393
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,708
off Gilan about 80 years ago.

394
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,333
The treasure is said to be
something around

395
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,375
100 million gold pieces.

396
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,416
Huh.

397
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,333
A positively obscene
amount of money!

398
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,875
One mention of gold and you
suddenly look like a child

399
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,416
who's been given a new toy.

400
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,583
Hidden treasure? I don't know.
