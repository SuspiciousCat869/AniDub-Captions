1
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,958
[NARRATOR] Andragoras's order,
tantamount to banishment,

2
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,291
compels Arslan to set out alone
to recruit new soldiers.

3
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,375
However, the Prince's companions

4
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,583
refused to obey
the King's mandate

5
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,500
and left his forces
to join Arslan.

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,875
The party wasted no time
turning their horses south

7
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,750
making straight for the
bustling port city of Gilan.

8
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,916
[ELAM]
Will we stop to rest soon?

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,166
[DARYUN] No. I would prefer
to continue on a little farther.

10
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,583
If that would be all right
with you, Your Highness.

11
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,083
[ARSLAN]
Of course. That will be fine.

12
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,250
Stop where you are and
we might let you live.

13
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,458
From the way they're
dressed, these must be--

14
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,875
Hand over all your
weapons and valuables.

15
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,125
We're not lookin' for a fight,

16
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,625
but every man's
gotta make a living,

17
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,916
and this is how we make ours.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,958
Bring it. Try it and die.

19
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,166
Ha. You should've just
done as we told you.

20
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,791
I guess you must not
value your lives.

21
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:06,583
I yield!

22
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,375
[ALFARáD]
Stop this!

23
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:09,875
Trust me, you
could all fight him

24
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,291
and you still wouldn't
stand a chance.

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,416
Is that, Lady Alfar+d?

26
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,583
[chuckles]

27
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,750
The city of Gilan isn't far,
just over these hills.

28
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,125
This should be good enough.

29
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,000
We appreciate the
escort. Thanks.

30
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,250
Look at us.

31
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,333
Who would think we'd end up

32
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,208
with a bunch of bandits
as our guides.

33
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,541
I think we're even more
surprised than you are.

34
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,375
Finding Lady Alfar+d in the
Crown Prince's company?

35
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,458
Mistress, are you really sure
you won't come back to us?

36
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, of course I'm sure.

37
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,875
Lord Narsus is my husband.
I can't leave his side.

38
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,166
You know, Lord Merlane
left us a while back.

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,875
Who is gonna lead us
now, Lady Alfar+d?

40
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,000
Honestly. That brother of
mine is nothing but trouble.

41
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,250
As the clan chief's son,

42
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,625
he really should have a
stronger sense of duty.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,250
[ZOT CLANSMAN A]
Master Narsus. No, Chief!

44
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,833
Uh, I--

45
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,500
[ZOT CLANSMAN A] We of the Zot
Clan are in need of a leader.

46
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,750
Today, we swear
our loyalty to you.

47
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,541
[BOTH gasp]

48
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,625
And why would you, um...

49
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,708
Lady Alfar+d has made it clear
that you're her chosen consort.

50
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,083
That position makes you
as good as our clan chief.

51
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,708
Hey! Just a moment. I have
never once called her my wife!

52
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,291
Uh!

53
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,750
[GIEVE chuckles]

54
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,416
Master Strategist,
Court Painter, Lord of Daylam,

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,416
and now Chief of the Zot Clan.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,166
You have a lot on your
plate, Lord Narsus.

57
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,125
Please, Chief, and
you too, Prince Arslan,

58
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,875
if you ever find yourself
in need of help,

59
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,875
don't be shy about
calling on us.

60
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,375
Doesn't matter where you are.

61
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,500
The Zot Clan will come
to fight by your side.

62
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,125
Thanks. I will remember that.

63
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,541
[gasps]

64
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,333
So that is the sea.

65
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,375
That's right, you've
never seen it before.

66
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,000
Quite a sight, isn't it?

67
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,583
Yes.

68
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,041
It's even more amazing than all
the stories make it out to be.

69
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,833
For someone who wishes
to become King of Pars,

70
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,666
I know so little of the
kingdom I would rule.

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,166
Your Highness, a King
is still human.

72
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,958
And no human can learn
all there is to know

73
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,291
about a place overnight.

74
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,875
That's right, don't worry.

75
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,625
You have plenty of years ahead
to learn all about the kingdom.

76
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,583
You love Pars, and you will
come to know it well over time.

77
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,791
That is what makes a good King.

78
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,541
I suppose I'll just have
to be patient. Right?

79
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,041
Let's hurry down to Gilan.

80
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,625
We have many men
left to recruit.

81
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,791
There's something new
everywhere you look.

82
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,208
I'm surprised. I think it may
be even busier than Ecbatana.

83
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,666
You can find exotic beauties

84
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,250
from 60 different
countries in Gilan.

85
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,833
So even if you were to visit a
different country every night,

86
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,791
it'd take two months
to tour the world.

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,541
Oh, what an arduous task!

88
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,458
[ALFARáD]
Amazing quality.

89
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,583
Perfect color for
a wedding outfit.

90
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,750
Narsus and I will have to hold

91
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,208
a proper ceremony
someday, after all.

92
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,791
[chuckles]

93
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,291
Ahh. You can't find fresher fish
anywhere than in a port city.

94
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,875
I wonder if I should
buy this now.

95
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,166
No, it'll just be more to carry.

96
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,208
I should wait till
we're settled.

97
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,208
Except if I wait too long
and they sell out...

98
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,666
We have some lovely jewelry,
and it's well priced.

99
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,000
[JASWANT]
I'm not really looking.

100
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,708
Look we have just
the necklace for you,

101
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,625
all the ladies in Sindhura
will just love it

102
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,625
and it brings out your eyes.

103
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,708
Now hold still a moment!

104
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,375
[MERCHANT A]
Oh, my, just look at it!

105
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,750
You're sure to attract
every woman's eye wearing that!

106
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,416
And the price is
very reasonable.

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Look at all of you!

108
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,041
Carrying on like that when we're
here on such important business.

109
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,541
We didn't come to this city
to have fun, you know.

110
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,916
This city, it's turning
them into giddy fools.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,458
Yes, exactly.

112
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,916
I expect the prosperity of Gilan
is going to be a great help

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,125
to us in our
recruitment efforts.

114
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,583
[MAN A]
Get this stuff moving!

115
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,083
What is it? You look troubled.

116
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,916
No, I'm fine.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
Well, Narsus,
now that we're here,

118
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,458
where do you think it would be
best for us to go first?

119
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,916
Actually, an old friend of mine

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,875
from my days at the Royal
Academy lives here.

121
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,083
I think it would be a good
idea to visit him first

122
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,083
and ask him to take
us to the Viceroy.

123
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,458
Very well. Then that's
what we'll do.

124
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
I didn't realize you
had any friends.

125
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,208
Yes, it's quite a surprise.

126
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,083
He must be something
of an eccentric.

127
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,708
Or one who's inclined to
take pity on the friendless.

128
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,416
Hilarious.

129
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,875
[SHAGHAD]
Narsus! Good of you to come!

130
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,416
Welcome to Gilan.

131
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,000
It has been too long, Shaghad!
Since our time at the Academy.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,791
We're practically old men!

133
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,958
I've been hearing stories
though, Lord Master Tactician.

134
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,541
Seems you've found a way to put
that wiliness of yours to use.

135
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,625
Wily, me?

136
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,458
As I recall, you were
the mastermind

137
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,166
of all those pranks we pulled
back in our school days.

138
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,625
Do you know my favorite?

139
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,583
When you rewrote the entire
contents of that textbook.

140
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,916
It wasn't just me.

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,916
You were happy enough
to help as well.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,541
Ah! We sure did know how to
get ourselves into trouble!

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,666
[BOTH laugh]

144
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,041
Well what do you know...

145
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
It looks like they actually
could be good friends.

146
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,041
I don't think I've ever
seen Lord Narsus

147
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,250
that much at ease with anyone

148
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,250
other than Daryun
and His Highness.

149
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,583
And if what I hear is true,

150
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
that must be
Crown Prince Arslan.

151
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,541
If I may introduce myself,
Your Highness,

152
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,583
my name is Shaghad, and I
am a merchant here in Gilan.

153
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,500
It is an honor to make
your acquaintance.

154
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,250
I am honored as well.

155
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,333
We arrived here
without any notice,

156
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,541
and yet you have
greeted us warmly.

157
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,250
Thank you for your kindness.

158
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,500
[SHAGHAD] You must be tired
from your long journey.

159
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,708
Please come in and make
yourselves comfortable.

160
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,875
All in your company are welcome.

161
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
[SHAGHAD]
Incredible!

162
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,250
King Andragoras escaped
the Lusitanians?

163
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,375
Is this really true?

164
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,583
Yes.

165
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,166
[SHAGHAD]
That is excellent news.

166
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,666
With the King safely returned,

167
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,458
does this mean that
we will finally be able

168
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,000
to drive those savages out
of our country for good?

169
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,291
Yes.

170
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,541
But if we are to be successful,

171
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,500
I believe we may need
help from Gilan.

172
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,375
I see, Narsus. So that's
what this is about.

173
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,333
King Andragoras has
ordered His Highness

174
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,416
to assemble an army
of 50,000 men

175
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,791
so we can retake the kingdom.

176
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,041
[SHAGHAD]
And the wealth of Gilan

177
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,500
could prove very useful
in achieving that goal.

178
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,208
I will speak with the Viceroy
about what we require.

179
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,291
And I thought that you
might be willing to negotiate

180
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,541
with the city's merchants
on our behalf.

181
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,625
Would you honor me
with that favor?

182
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,041
Please don't bow like that.
It makes me nervous.

183
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,458
This is me you're talking to,
not some stranger.

184
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,500
So--?

185
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,208
Did you really think
I would refuse

186
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,083
when my oldest friend in the
world is asking me for a favor?

187
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,416
However--

188
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,916
[ARSLAN]
A problem?

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,583
Well, although you've been
in the city only a short time,

190
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,833
Your Highness, you must have
made certain observations.

191
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,416
We are a prosperous city

192
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,958
and one that depends
on slave labor.

193
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,875
There can't be anyone
throughout the kingdom

194
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,875
who doesn't know of your
Decree to Abolish Slavery.

195
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,166
However, it should be
no surprise to you

196
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,041
that the merchants in this
city strongly object to it.

197
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,833
Oh. I see.

198
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,666
[GIEVE]
Forgive me for being blunt,

199
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
but as you are a
merchant yourself,

200
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,458
does that mean you
object to the decree?

201
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,791
Of course he doesn't.

202
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,416
We made a pact when we
were students together.

203
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,916
That we'd always fight
to put an end to slavery.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,375
He feels as we do.

205
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,166
Uh. Yes. I remember that.

206
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,000
Really? Then we'll
have you on our side?

207
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,875
You can put your faith
in me, Highness.

208
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,250
I assure you that as a
loyal subject of Pars,

209
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,875
I will always do what I can
in order to better this country.

210
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,125
Good.

211
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,791
I am very glad to have
your support, Shaghad.

212
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

213
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:15,625
[ALFARáD snoring]

214
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,208
[SHAGHAD]
I have to say.

215
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,458
The last thing I expected was to
find out that you had married.

216
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,333
Gods! Where did you hear that?

217
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,125
Your lady wife came by earlier.

218
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,375
She and I had a
lovely conversation.

219
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,791
She's quite lively
and a beautiful girl.

220
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,958
But don't you think you are
perhaps a bit too old for her?

221
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,791
Oh, Alfari+d.
Why must you always--?

222
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,833
[chuckles] Don't be shy now.

223
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,375
I am not being shy.

224
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,375
I assure you, that young woman
and I are nothing more th--

225
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Fine. Let's just let it go.

226
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,166
There was something else that
I wanted to talk to you about.

227
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,041
His Highness's grand decree.

228
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,250
I thought it an empty
gesture at first,

229
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,291
but he truly wants to abolish
slavery, doesn't he?

230
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,791
[NARSUS]
So it's true.

231
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,958
I'd hoped my suspicions were
wrong, but you keep slaves.

232
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,000
[SHAGHAD] Some, of course.
You do realize I'm a merchant.

233
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,250
I can't afford not to.

234
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,791
Really, if you set your
moral qualms aside,

235
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,791
you'll see how
practical slavery is.

236
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,416
I can assure you
that without it,

237
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,083
Pars would not be enjoying
its current prosperity.

238
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,250
[NARSUS]
All these years later

239
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,250
and that's how
you see the world.

240
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,541
All it means is that
I've grown up.

241
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,000
A world where everybody lives
in comfortable equality?

242
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,833
The very idea of
it is ludicrous,

243
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,833
nothing more than
a childish fantasy.

244
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,250
And the Prince is
still but a child.

245
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,041
Careful how you speak.

246
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,583
Come now, Narsus.

247
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:40,583
You cannot seriously support
all these wild policies of his.

248
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,916
Hold on a moment,
are you saying?

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,333
Equality for all may
in fact be a fantasy.

250
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,750
Or maybe it's not.

251
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,500
His Highness plans to find out,
and I plan to help him.

252
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,625
I follow Prince Arslan's
lead wholeheartedly

253
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,166
and without reservations.

254
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,208
Strange to hear that from you.

255
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,208
Considering how much
you have always hated

256
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,708
to serve under somebody
else's command.

257
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,000
True enough.

258
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,458
If I'm being honest,

259
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,416
I suspect I'm just as surprised
about it as anyone else.

260
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,833
To be fair though,

261
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,000
I am also surprised you
wound up becoming a merchant.

262
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,875
I don't know. Is it truly
that hard to understand?

263
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,583
I'm surrounded by tangible
proof of my success.

264
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,916
And you're off chasing dreams.
I know which life I'd prefer.

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,375
[NARSUS] Yes, well,
you do have a lovely home.

266
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,541
We should go into
business together.

267
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,708
If we joined forces, we would
be unstoppable. Forget Pars!

268
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,208
You and I would be the
wealthiest men in all the world!

269
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,166
A nice offer, but I'll decline.

270
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,916
As you may have noticed,
I have other things to do.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,416
[laughs]

272
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,791
You can't blame a man
for trying, can you?

273
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,375
That Prince must
really be something

274
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,666
to command your loyalty.

275
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,208
Yes. I think you'll
come to see it in time.

276
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,958
Now, I've stayed
chatting far too long.

277
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,750
We have an early
morning tomorrow.

278
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,750
It's past time for me
to find my bed.

279
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,041
[SHAGHAD]
Indeed.

280
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,625
[NARSUS]
Shaghad.

281
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,166
What is it?

282
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,333
[NARSUS]
Earlier this evening,

283
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,500
you said that as a
loyal citizen of Pars,

284
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,625
you would do whatever you could

285
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,666
for the betterment
of this country.

286
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,666
[SHAGHAD]
Yes.

287
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,416
And I wasn't lying
when I said it.

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,791
I have always been
a loyal Parsian,

289
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:15,500
and I will do everything in my
power to help His Highness.

290
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,166
Thank you for that.

291
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,291
[CREWMAN A]
Captain! We've sighted land!

292
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,500
[GRZE]
Good!

293
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,875
We'll be able to ride
the landward breeze

294
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,291
right into harbor.

295
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,750
[CREWMEN]
Aye-aye!

296
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,541
[SHAGHAD] This is the office
of Gilan's Viceroy.

297
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,875
[ELAM] There really are
no words for this place.

298
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,958
I thought Shaghad's mansion
was pretty ostentatious.

299
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,958
But compared to this,
it's almost humble.

300
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,875
This fellow must be doing
awfully well for himself.

301
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,583
[PELAGIUS]
Your Highness!

302
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,541
[laughing]

303
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,541
How good it is to see you again!

304
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,291
And looking so well!

305
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,916
This has been a long
and trying war,

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,500
and my heart has been
filled with worry for you.

307
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,083
You are in charge here?

308
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:18,208
Yes. I am Pelagius, Highness,
Viceroy of Gilan.

309
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,458
My, but you have grown to
be such a fine young man!

310
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,125
Perhaps you remember,
Your Highness.

311
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,875
I was the first to race
to the Royal Capital

312
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,000
upon the news of your birth,

313
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,583
so eager was I to
have the honor...

314
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,500
[DARYUN] I'm not sure how much
longer I can listen to this man.

315
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,125
Shameless flattery at its worst.

316
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,791
Losing the Royal Capital
was truly tragic.

317
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,041
I feel it most keenly every day.

318
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,375
Oh?

319
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,416
How fortunate that your
sorrow didn't prevent you

320
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,708
from acquiring such a
vast horde of goods.

321
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,291
Oh! Not at all!

322
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,916
They look imposing, I know, but
they are of inferior quality.

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,125
[JASWANT]
Are they?

324
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,291
[PELAGIUS screams]

325
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:53,875
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,375
No, please.

327
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,958
The Lusitanian war has
restricted trade access,

328
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,041
making all routes
across land unusable,

329
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,583
so any goods going to or
coming from other countries

330
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,166
must pass through here.

331
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,625
Quite a lucrative turn
of events for you, yes?

332
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,541
Well, yes, of course.

333
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,666
I mean, no! Our gains
have been modest, truly.

334
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,208
This city's wealth
is undeniable.

335
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,166
With it, surely you
could've mustered an army

336
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,666
and provided us
with reinforcements

337
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,833
during our campaign.

338
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,625
Indeed, there's a good
reason we did not,

339
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,041
a very good reason.

340
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
Yes!

341
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm sad to report that we have
been the target of pirates

342
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,750
for some time now.

343
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that so?

344
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,166
It is, my Lord.

345
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,375
Things seem to get
worse by the day.

346
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,958
The waters off our shores
are infested with vermin

347
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,791
eager to attack merchant vessels
and make off with their goods.

348
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,500
I've heard something of this.

349
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,458
But everybody knows
that major port cities

350
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,583
are vulnerable to
attack from pirates.

351
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,791
Surely you must have learned
to defend against them

352
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,125
over the years.

353
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,208
We ourselves were attacked
by bandits yesterday.

354
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,458
And yet that has not deterred
us from doing our duty.

355
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,083
[PELAGIUS] I don't think you
fully understand the situation.

356
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,000
These aren't just any ordinary
pirates that we're up against.

357
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,125
How are they different?

358
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,958
They're elusive and organized!

359
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,166
They appear in waters
that are thinly patrolled,

360
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,125
as if they know
exactly where to be.

361
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,291
Then swiftly carry
out their attack

362
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,666
and escape before the civic
guard can even reach the area!

363
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,125
Well, I admit they sound
oddly proficient.

364
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,000
More than any others I've known.

365
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,333
It's my personal suspicion there
is someone behind all this,

366
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,041
some mastermind who is
pulling the pirates' strings.

367
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,791
So you see, we couldn't
simply send our troops

368
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,541
away from the city
and leave it unguarded.

369
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,083
I couldn't sleep at night

370
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,166
after learning we'd lost the
Royal Capital to those savages.

371
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,291
But I had no choice!

372
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,083
[PELAGIUS crying]

373
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,833
[PELAGIUS]
Please pardon me for a moment.

374
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,041
What do you make of it?

375
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,541
I have my doubts.

376
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,625
From what I saw before,

377
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,333
this doesn't exactly
look like a city

378
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
that's besieged by pirates.

379
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,833
[NARSUS] We don't have
enough information yet

380
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,541
to make a final judgment.

381
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,250
Perhaps we should wait until
we know a little more first.

382
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,416
Yes. I agree.

383
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
[PELAGIUS]
I am so sorry that you witnessed

384
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,041
that embarrassing display.

385
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,083
As an apology,
I've brought a fine wine

386
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,125
that arrived from Serica
just yesterday.

387
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,791
Please enjoy.

388
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,583
The Djinn are
clamoring violently.

389
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,500
[JASWANT]
There's smoke.

390
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Look! Pirate ships.

391
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,750
An attack?

392
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,041
Keep fighting, boys!
We're almost there!

393
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,875
The Port of Gilan is
right in front of us.

394
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,208
[CREWMAN A]
Captain Gre! Grappling hooks!

395
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,625
They'll board us before
much longer, sir!

00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,708
Quick! Get me another spear.

Aye, sir!

Cowards.

399
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,791
It's not as if they can't see
what's going on out here.

400
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,291
Is the entire city of Gilan
looking the other way?

401

Damn it!

What was that?

404
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,166
Let's take them.

405
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,625
Of course we will.

406
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,625
What better way to put
this city in our debt

407
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,625
than by saving their ship?

408
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,041
Keep moving! Board the
merchant vessel!

What are you, some
kinda demon soldier?

[GIEVE] Have you been
fighting him this whole time

420
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,541
without knowing who he is?

421
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,208
I almost pity you.

This man is the greatest
warrior in all of Pars.

I give you, Marzb Daryun!

That's Daryun?

It's the Mard fu Mard!

426
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,125
So who wants to keep fighting?

What was that?

00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,208
Thought I would speed
things up a bit.

[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. June.

434
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,333
Not long after their arrival,

435
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,708
it became clear that a new fight
awaited Arslan and his company

436
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,750
in the city of Gilan.

437
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:08,083
However, as for what shape that
fight would ultimately take,

438
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:12,000
there was no way for the young
Prince and his friends to know.

439
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,583
[NARRATOR] Elam looked nervously
from one man to the other.

440
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,750
He was entirely
on Narsus' side,

441
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,541
but he was sorry
to see his master

442
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,250
in such a terrible fight
with his old friend.

443
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,291
Next time, "Parting of Ways."
