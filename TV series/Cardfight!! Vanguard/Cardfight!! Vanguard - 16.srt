that I'm in love

169
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,722
with the most beautiful
girl in the world?

170
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,723
Uh...

171
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,825
My darling Kourin and I

172
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,460
couldn't be happier.

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,095
I think you finally
lost your mind.

174
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,898
(laughing)

175
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,800
Long time, no see Aichi.

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,069
I'm surprised you
decided to show up.

177
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,203
Either you're brave,

178
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,439
or not very smart.

179
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,341
Team Handsome.

180
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,442
Huh?

181
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,376
Big brother!

182
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,578
Don't move, Kamui, stay down.

183
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,013
Play dead, yo.

184
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:04,417
So these are the guys you
chose to play with over us?

185
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,253
Would you look at this
bunch of scallywags?

186
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,656
They're not even in the
same league as Team Handsome.

187
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,359
(laughing)

188
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,228
Too bad it's not
a costume contest.

189
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,997
What did you say?

190
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,732
Whoa, hold on, Gouki.

191
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:23,503
You can't fight in here.

192
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,672
We're all here for
the same reason.

193
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,007
Listen, I don't know
who they're gonna

194
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,742
match us up with out there,

195
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,611
but you guys better not
lose until you face us.

196
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,013
Same goes for you.

197
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,915
Ha, gotta get the
last word in, huh?

198
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,317
I like that.

199
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,353
Let's go.

200
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,488
Huh?

201
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,690
Goodbye for now, my love.

202
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,763
Our computer is about to
randomly select the teams

203
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,700
for the first round.

204
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,902
But before we do that

205
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,537
equally important

206
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,173
I still have to introduce
myself to all of you.

207

Call me MC Mya.

208
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,176
Nobody cares what your name is!

209
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,278
Now hurry up and tell us who's
playing in the first round.

210

Without further ado,

211

the first two teams
facing each other

212

in today's regional qualifier

213
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,220
will be...

214
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,088
Huh?

215
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,723

218

So we're playing
against a bunch of kids.

219
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,698

222

That should be obvious by now.

223
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,608
I'm Kurasawa.

224
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,544
My name's Kurasaki.

225
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,679
And I'm Kuroda.

226

00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, wait, I think I've got it.

228
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,717
You guys must be our
opponents in the first round,

229
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,019
Black Magic, right?

230
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,986
Of course!

231
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,321
I mean, there's three of them

232
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,590
and they're all
wearing black robes.

233

Huh?

234
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,762
Way to ruin our introduction.

235
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,630
Oh, no, I'm really sorry.

236
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,133
Yeah, we weren't trying
to rain on your parade.

237
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,635
So, why do you guys dress
yourselves like that?

238
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,803
I'm glad you asked.

239
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,571
See, we‐‐

240
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,639
Going to a costume party?

241
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,274
You did it again!

242
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,709
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,244
Yo, Black Magic.

244
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,446
Your moms called, they
want their curtains back.

245
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,148
Curtains?

246
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,683
We'll have you know
that these cloaks

247
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,452
were tailor made for
our Vanguard team.

248
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,653
Oh, really?

249
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,155
So that means you're
a bunch of grown men

250
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,957
that like to dress
up as wizards.

251
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,024
I bet you wouldn't complain

252
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,693
if they were
dressed like ninjas.

253
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,596
Yeah, but they're not dressed
as ninjas, now are they?

254
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,799
These guys are just
Halloween rejects.

255
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,801
Who does he think he is?

256
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,169
Don't worry about it.

257
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,203
He won't be talking like that

258
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,105
for very much longer.

259
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,406
He'll be shaking with fear

260
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,209
once he sees the power
of our Black Magic.

261
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,577
Oh, no!

262
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,013
I think these guys
might be actual wizards.

263
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,448
Did you really just say that?

264
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,682
How old are you?

265
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,952
I think you missed your naptime.

266
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,554
Our skills at the
game of Vanguard

267
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,656
are not to be taken lightly.

268
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,758
We'll see you on
the battlefield,

269
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,194
Team Q4.

270
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,396
I look forward to
watching you lose.

271
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,165
Hey, cool it, man.

272
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,301
Well, our team sure has
an interesting first match.

273
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,369
Wait.

274
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,204
Have any of you guys
seen Misaki yet?

275
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,372
Yeah.

276
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,740
She told me she wouldn't
be able to get here

277
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,208
until the afternoon.

278
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,142
Don't worry though,

279
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,110
I'm sure she'll make it in time

280
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,845

Oh, well that's good.

What?

283

only moments away.

285

Without Misaki we're not
gonna have enough players.

What are you talking about?

These are special
Vanguard gloves.

You're supposed to

during the battle.

316
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,233
Putting this on will allow you

to view the battlefield
right in front of your eyes

the way it looks in your mind.

You're using Royal Paladins,

But your allies can't help you

Way to go, Aichi!

He replenished his

Well, the situation

No cards, yo.

Looks like Aichi's
been pushed so far

00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,201
that he had to
use all his cards.

And even with that,

Alfred's power is only 18,000.

He hasn't reached

His opponent is really tough.

I guess we shouldn't expect
anything less at this level.

On top of that, Gordon was just
added to his deck this morning.

So what's your point?

We made those changes
on the way over here.

We didn't have
time to play test it,
