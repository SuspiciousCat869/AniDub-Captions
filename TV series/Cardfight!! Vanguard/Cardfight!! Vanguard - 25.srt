I was two times the
jerk that you were.

499
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,707
We can't afford
to lose Misaki

500
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,509
as a friend and a teammate.

Okay, let's do this.

Misaki, you've
got to forgive us!

00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,450
My actions were
completely unacceptable!

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,684
Same with mine!

505
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,320
Please don't quit the team or
stop being friends with us!

Aichi, it was so amazing.

Misaki just defeated
everyone in the store.

Seriously, not a
single one of them

515
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,474
posed the slightest
challenge for me.

How am I supposed to
train for nationals

I'm up against?

You mean we're a team again?

00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,683
Yeah, but spare me
the tearful reunion.

Yeah.

Why not, it's good practice

Great, so for the

we're gonna drive
