Huh?

496
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,431
This is all so perfect.

497
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,632
What is?

498
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,234
Agh, you're kidding!

499
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:18,704
No, and if I win,
we're getting married!

500
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:19,805
Huh?

501
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,841
(screams)

502
00:22:26,812 --> 00:23:56,702
♪

503
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,708
Can you believe
we made the finals?

504
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,511
Can you believe
my mouth is still burning?

505
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,746
Kai and Kamui
could win it without me.

506
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,249
No way, you never know
what could happen!

507
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,851
But those guys
are really strong.

508
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,987
You're so naive;
we live in an era

509
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,689
where sandwiches fall
from the sky and land

510
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:17,690
in your mouth.

511
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,258
Uh, that was‐‐

512
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,159
Next time...

513
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,363
The setting for this
battle might as well

514
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,098
be a wedding reception.

515
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,934
Poor guy, it's his
toughest battle yet.
