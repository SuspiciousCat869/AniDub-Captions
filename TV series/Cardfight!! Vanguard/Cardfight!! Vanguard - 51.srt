00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,215
That's kind of you
to say, my student.

500
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,384
I've always valued
you as my protege.

501
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,487
After my next win,
I'll autograph your cards.

502
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,190
Somebody get a bucket
of water and wake this guy up.

503
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,826
Morikawa, everyone.

504
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,395
Next time,
"Songstress of the Sea."

505
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,964
With the pressure
of the National Tournament

506
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,932
looming over us,
it sure is nice

507
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,934
to just cut loose
and enjoy the game.
