Gouki is really good,
how long can I hold on?

500
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,346
Aichi, the best defense
is a good offense.

501
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,548
If you spend too much
of your hand on defense‐‐

502
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,549
Then I'll lose.

503
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,650
Oh, that's right.

504
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,852
If I lose,
so does the team.

Kai, Misaki, Kamui.

506
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,458
Okay, I'm gonna do
my best for everyone.

507
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,160
Team Q4, watch me.

508
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,496
Next time, The Holy
Dragon Descends.

509
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,597
I'll picture it.

00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,367
The winner of this
cardfight will be me.
