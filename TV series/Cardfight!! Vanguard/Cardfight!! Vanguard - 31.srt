than me in every way.

510
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,116
Now I have to fight Tetsu.

511
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,886
You face me without
fear in your heart,

512
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:18,023
but even so, you're
no match for the General.

513
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,892
I‐‐I have to win this.

514
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,860
Kamui, watch me.

515
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,863
Next time:
Demon World General.

516
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,598
I can't imagine the outcome.

517
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,267
There's too much happening.
