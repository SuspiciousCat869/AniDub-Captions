166
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,417
Are you getting us
into trouble?

167
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,820
It's okay, we just had a
little accident, that's all.

168
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,322
Are you okay, little guy?

169
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,423
Did you get hurt anywhere?

170
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,457
Little guy?

171
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,226
Don't talk down to me
like I'm some kid.

172
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,662
That sure is a nasty
scrape on your elbow.

173
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,331
Hold on a second,
I'm pretty sure I have

174
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,932
a bandage with me.

175
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,435
It's no big deal, so just
give it a rest, all right?

176
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,669
Oh, no, you're injured?

177
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,304
I feel really bad about this.

178
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,672
Everything's fine.

179
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,107
Here.

180
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,876
Oh, great, thank you.

181
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,978
Okay.

182
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,746
Who's a big, brave boy?

183
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,148
Yeah, well,
don't expect me to thank you.

184
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,683
You're welcome anyway.

185
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,051
(chuckling)

186
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,620
Just sad.

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,888
Huh?

188
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,757
(grunting)

189
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,292
Just great, you
knocked me over,

190
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,094
and now I don't
get to meet Dr. O!

191
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,330
Oh, as if it wasn't
bad enough already.

192
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,398
I'm really sorry.

193
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,200
Could he be any nicer?

194
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,007
Hmm, those kids.

195
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,274
What do you think
they're up to?

196
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,210
Looks like they're
arguing with another team.

197
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,578
I don't know how
long they'll last

198
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,946
if they go around
picking fights.

199
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,180
I wonder.

200
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,683
Wait, I just realized
who they're talking to.

201
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,884
What are the chances?

202
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,753
You're Team Caesar?

203
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,621
So, you've heard
of them before?

204
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,323
Are you kidding me, bro?

205
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,591
They were last
year's runner‐up,

206
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,395
and the year before, they
were national champions!

207
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,897
I had no idea.

208
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,967
Hey, look, everyone.

209
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,568
It's Team Caesar.

210
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,238
Oh, so the former
champions have returned then.

211
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,207
I bet they're looking
to get some revenge.

212
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,776
I think we should
go find a place

213
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,145
that's a little less crowded.

214
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,348
I'd rather not have all
these eyes staring at me.

215
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,351
Huh.

216
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,788
They must be really strong.

217
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,956
Oh, no, our bags!

218
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,192
Sorry, we just need a minute!

219
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,895
Amazing, it's like they were
meant to meet or something.

220
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,830
It's only a coincidence.

221
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,166
Was it fate or
just dumb luck?

222
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,767
We'll know the answer
to that question

223
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,602
once this tournament is over.

224
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,770
Right.

225
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,972
What do you mean?

226
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,674
This spot's better.

227
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,143
Isn't it about time you
got over your stage fright?

228
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,112
I just don't like it
when people look at me.

229
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,381
And, yet, when thousands of
fans are watching you play,

230
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,382
you're totally fine.

231
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,118
What a strange guy.

232
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,586
I don't think
we had the chance

233
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,721
to properly
introduce ourselves.

234
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,457
The name's Kenji Mitsusada,

235
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,158
and I'm the leader
of Team Caesar.

236
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,726
Just call me Yuri.

237
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,928
She's my big sister.

238
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,962
They call me Gai.

239
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,164
Wait, so your name's
Kenji Mitsusada?

240
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,800
I thought you called him
by a different name earlier.

241
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,535
Oh, yeah, Koutei.

242
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,270
‐Koutei?
‐Yeah.

243
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,606
It's a nickname he
got when we were kids.

244
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,209
So I guess you've been
friends for a long time.

245
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,310
So what's the reason for you

246
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,911
calling yourselves
"Team Caesar"?

247
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,113
Yeah, good question.

248
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,447
I guess I should explain,

249
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,682
otherwise you'll
wind up thinking

250
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,884
we're named after a
salad or something.

251
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,752
See, nearly 2,000 years ago,

252
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,555
this guy named Julius Caesar
lived in Ancient Rome

253
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,624
and he was a
powerful general who‐‐

254
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,659
Spare us the lecture.

255
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,561
But I was about to
get to the good part.

256
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,697
Yeah, well, I don't
want to hear any parts,

257
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,198
good, bad, or otherwise.

258
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,935
Fine, how about we settle for
the story of Octavius then?

259
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,137
Kidding.

260
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,806
Basically, Koutei is a huge
fan of Ancient Roman history,

261
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,241
so we named ourselves after

262
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,675
one of their
greatest emperors.

263
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,510
That makes sense, right?

264
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,611
Sure does.

265
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,846
(screaming)

266
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,816
It's my Kourin!

267
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,918
Morikawa's here?

268
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,219
(chuckling)

269
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,021
Finally, my collection
of Ultra Rare

270
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,123
limited‐edition
merchandise is complete!

271
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,893
I've just accomplished
all I set out to do today.

272
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,161
So that was your whole reason

273
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,729
for coming to the
national tournament?

274
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,833
I guess cheering for Team Q4
will have to take a back seat.

275
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,501
Don't look too
jealous there, guys.

276
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,737
This little baby just
gave me a huge boost

277
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,372
to my Ultra Rare
fan club points,

278
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,807
which pretty much means
I'm the best boyfriend ever,

279
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,043
if I'm not mistaken.

280
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,980
Hey, Aichi, look at all
the cool stuff I got!

281
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,248
Give it a rest, man.

282
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,516
Try and stop me!

283
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,618
Annoying as he is,
there's something reflexing

284
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,853
about seeing him here,

285
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,454
‐you know?
‐Relaxing?

286
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,722
Having some friendly faces

287
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,357
around really
puts you at ease.

288
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,592
Hardly.

289
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,762
That reminds me, weren't Reiji
and Eiji gonna come today?

290
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:40,133
Oh, no, I hope those two
didn't take the wrong train.

291
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,402
Actually, if Morikawa
managed to make it,

292
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,604
I'm sure they won't have any
problems finding their way.

293
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,772
Good call.

294
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,507
Watch what you say
about me, Kamui,

295
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,042
or I'll have to
come over there!

296
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,044
Could he actually hear me?

297
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,880
Nah, he probably just
assumed you said it.

298
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,181
Impressive.

299
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,416
Totally.

300
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,719
Hmm, weird, I feel like
we're forgetting something.

301
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,654
Where is everyone?

302
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,357
I told you to wait
here and you didn't.

‐Me too?
‐Obviously.

00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,570
into the opening
ceremonies this year.

327
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,372
You mean it's not
always like this?

328
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,041
Well, they do their best
to make it exciting,

329
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,876
but this is taking it
to a whole new level.

330
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,444
‐I mean...
‐Kourin!

331
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,680
...a concert by Ultra
Rare is pretty big.

332
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,715
If they plan on doing
the same thing next year,

333
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,817
I'll be sure to bring
some ear plugs.

334
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,452
This might not be
our type of music,

335
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,920
but it looks like
those guys are having

336
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,188
the time of their lives.

337
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,590
Uh, did she just call me
one of these guys?

338
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,128
The men of Earth can't
get enough of Ultra Rare!

339
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,964
Nonsense.

340
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,701
Which one of you called
my Ultra Rare "nonsense"?

341
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,902
Calm down, Morikawa.

342
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,571
I didn't hear anyone over
there say that sort of thing.

343
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,506
Really, 'cause I
could have sworn

344
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,944
I heard someone
say that, or did I?

345
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,012
He acts without thinking,

346
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,514
and then immediately
doubts himself.

347
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,983
This guy's ridiculous.

348
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,553
Hey, what's it like being
on a team with four players?

349
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,521
Do your top three players
hog all the action,

350
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,956
or does everyone
get a chance?

351
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,358
Huh?

352
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,459
Do you change up your order

353
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,261
based on who your
opponent is or...

354
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,832
Or maybe you guys don't
waste time thinking about it.

355
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,167
Well, we, uh...

356
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,235
I forgot.

357
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,237
We'll be fighting as
a three‐person team

358
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,574
just like at the
regional tournament.

359
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,243
Misaki wasn't there
last time, so she's in.

360
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,613
Between Kai and Kamui, I don't
think I can steal a spot.

361
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,248
Guess I'm sitting out.

362
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,716
Give it a rest, Gai.

363
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,719
It's rude to poke your nose
into another team's strategy.

364
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,687
Oh.

365
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,921
It doesn't matter.

366
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,624
‐Huh?
‐Hmm?

367
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,261
Deciding who plays doesn't
involve any strategy.

368
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,797
It's easy, the weakest
player on our team

369
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,932
will always sit out.

370
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,033
And that's final.

371
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,702
‐Oh, yeah?
‐Problem?

372
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,471
How about you show some
respect to your teammates?

373
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,539
Hmm.

374
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,908
Calm down, guys, there's
no need to get angry.

375
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
Look, this is
Team Q4 business,

376
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,312
and I'd appreciate it if
you kept out, all right?

377
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,414
Uh, sure.

378
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,151
I don't care about
you or this team.

379
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,620
‐That's it.
‐It's okay, Kamui.

380
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,422
‐Come on, bro.
‐I know I'm not gonna get

381
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,691
the chance to play.

382
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,127
Kai's right, we should
have our top three players

383
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,730
representing the team
whenever possible.

384
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,165
And with the way
you guys play,

385
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,634
we all know who
the weakest link is.

386
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,969
I don't mind.

387
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,372
Are you sure?

388
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,840
That settles it then.

There's something
I need to know, Kai.

391
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,883
Why does a guy like you
even play Vanguard anyway?

392
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,520
The thrill of taking a strong
player and destroying them.

393
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:59,225
That's the whole reason
I play this game.

394
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,994
Is that all?

395
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,230
Yeah.

396
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,833
Well then.

♪

398
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,072
You know, the whole reason I
started going to Card Capital

399
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,542
is that there wasn't
anywhere else for me to play.

400
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,344
I needed to get
myself as far away

401
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,146
from Team Handsome as possible,

402
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,449
so I decided to try card
fighting at a different store.

403
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,184
I was only in it for myself.

404
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,153
I didn't care about the
team or the rest of you,

as long as we won our games.

406
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,325
But all that's changed now

407
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,427
'cause I know we have
something special.

408
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:38,564
I want us to win this
tournament together.

If she wants to quit,
I say we let her do it.

But, Kai...

413
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,609
You act like she's the
only one with a past.

414
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,978
If she's gonna use a car
accident as an excuse

415
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,014
for her own weakness,
then we don't need her.

to the people
around you, Kai?

(sighing)

419
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,356
I guess being on this team

420
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,292
doesn't mean anything
to you, does it?

421

Forget the team.

I can bring myself

jerk like him anymore.

Really, you don't get
excited singing for everyone?

491

I just don't have the energy
for this kind of thing.

Oh, it's 'cause

That's enough.
