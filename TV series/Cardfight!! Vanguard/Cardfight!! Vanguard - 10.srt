499
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,034
I hope you paid attention
to today's lesson,

500
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,104
because you're about
to take the final exam.

501
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,775
I attack Blaster Blade
with Chigasumi!

502
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,043
Since my hand is
bigger than yours,

503
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,714
Chigasumi gets an additional
3,000 attack power this turn.

504
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,017
Forcing me to discard makes
his units more powerful, too!

505
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,252
This is unreal!

506
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,120
Ahh!

507
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,789
(wincing)

508
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,960
♪

509
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,396
So that puts him at five damage.

510
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,899
What could he possibly
do with one card?

511
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,636
I guess only a ninja
can stop a ninja.

512
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,437
Oh!

513
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,207
(all wincing)

514
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,075
We always play a
game of numbers,

515
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,944
whether you have more
cards or less cards,

516
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,913
we ninjas have an answer.

517
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,015
I can only imagine your despair,

518
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,653
being cornered like a rat!

519
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,156
Now, I pass it over to you.

520
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,892
This turn will be
your last, Aichi.

521
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:11,197
Think long and hard about
the move you're going to make.

522
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,199
But your tiny hand really limits

523
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,202
your options right about now.

524
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,437

525
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,306

Kai managed to win

556
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,643
Focus on this battle.

557
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,178
Though it's important
to think ahead,

558
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,281
you must always remember to
remain present in the moment.

559
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,651
Yes, teacher,
I mean ninja master.

560
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,220
Humans live in the real world,
but these games we play

561
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,490
are extensions of
our virtual selves.

562
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,658
I see!

563
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,428
Next time, ninja
fighter withdraws!

564
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,464
I'm picturing myself victorious,
I understand now, teacher!

565
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,000
Excellent work, huh?
