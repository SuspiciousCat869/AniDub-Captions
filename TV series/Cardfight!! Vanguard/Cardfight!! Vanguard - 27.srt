I only got one

But I managed to get
rid of Cannon Gear.

That really wasn't
the most impressive turn.

Aichi's doing well down there.

Huh?

All the pressure of

is weighing
on Aichi's head.

In the first few
turns of this battle,

516
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,053
we've seen both players
take a very cautious approach.

517
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,621
Neither willing
to over commit.

518
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,423
Going forward from here,
the units these players

519
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,092
send out could have a huge
impact on the outcome.

Is that all
you're gonna say?

Yeah, the best thing
we can do right now

526
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,537
is sit back and enjoy.

You know that when
we're out at Vanguard events,

you have to address me
