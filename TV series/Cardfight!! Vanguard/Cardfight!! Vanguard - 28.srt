team Jurassic Army

177
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,069
versus team Quadrifoglio.

178
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,671
It's been a fierce
battle so far,

179
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,906

to a close.

Right, Doctor?

181

Absolutely.

182
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,544
The player from
team Q4 is really

183
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,113
backed into
a corner right now,

184
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,148
and unless he can do
three damage this turn,

185
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,616
I'd say he's finished.

186
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,585
That is a tall order.

187
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,687
Three damage
at this stage?

188
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,523
Exactly, I'm glad
you see it that way.

189

The chances of him
pulling this one off

190

are tiny.

191
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,761
Well, in my honest opinion,

192
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,429
it seems completely impossible.

193
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,797

One of the best
things about Vanguard

197

but I didn't win.

510
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,845
Me too, and I even
knew what my opponent

511
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,013
had in his hand.

512
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,748
That's what's scary about
the National Tournament,

513
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,216
but also makes it so fun.

514
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,685
There's no sense
in feeling down.

515
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,020
Think of all the people
that don't even get this chance.

516
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,322
Someone say my name?

517
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,423
Yeah!

518
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,058
We represent Card Capital.

519
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,327
Let's show them we
have what it takes.

520
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,996
Next time,
When the Moon is Full.

521
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,831
I'm imagining
my victory,

522
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,633
and I see my father's cards.
