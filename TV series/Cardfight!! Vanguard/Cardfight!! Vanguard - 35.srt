Our special training.

170
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,191
"Special training?"

171
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,426
Yeah.

172
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,761
We need to find the strength
to defeat Team Asteroid

173
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,063
and the only way to do that

174
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,598
is if we undergo special
Vanguard training.

175
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,735
Training.

176
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,704
Maybe I could beat Kai!

177
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,406
Sure, training makes
anything possible.

178
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,109
Alright, let's do this.

179
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,178
But first, before we start,

180
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,713
I need to know that
you'll be able to follow

181
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,048
the Kamui training
regimen without question!

182
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,550
Can you do that?

183
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,051
Yes, sir!

184
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,553
What are you?

185
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,654
(groaning)

186
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,824
There are leaders and
then there are followers.

187
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,258
No kidding.

188
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,760
Those two are so similar,

189
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,631
I'm surprised they
aren't best friends.

190
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,699
Here we are, guys.

191
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,668
The perfect place to start.

192
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,870
So what exactly do you
have planned for us?

193
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,472
We have to begin
with the basics,

194
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,307
so let's do some
practice draws.

195
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,209
‐Really?
‐Really.

196
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,276
First, you need
to make sure

197
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,579
your feet are
shoulder width apart.

198
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,447
Drop your hips down,

199
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,951
then calmly pull your hand
back into striking position.

200
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,519
Your eyes fixed
on the target

201
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,421
like an eagle
circling its prey.

202
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,591
Intensity in your gaze.

203
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,525
And draw!

204
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,431
Draw!

205
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,532
‐Draw!
‐Yes!

206
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,733
‐Draw!
‐Great start, Morikawa!

207
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,602
‐Draw!
‐Draw.

208
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,836
I can't hear you!

209
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:01,808
Draw, draw,
draw, draw, draw.

210
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,978
Draw, draw, draw.

211
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,379
I‐‐I draw.

212
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,547
No, no!

213
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,182
Your grab is too weak.

214
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,417
You've got to lunge forward

215
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,585
like it's the last card
you're ever gonna get.

216
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,254
Draw, draw, draw, draw!

217
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,989
I draw!

218
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:16,990
Right.

219
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,892
A thousand more!

220
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,360
Get to it!

221
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,394
Yes, sir!

222
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,196
All together now!

223
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,365

That's how they're planning to
spend their day at the beach?

227
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,441
Silly boys.

228
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,378
Believe it or not, ladies,
it's worse over here.

229
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,779
‐Nine hundred and ninety nine.
‐Nine hundred and ninety nine.

230

‐One thousand.
‐One thousand.

232
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,252
Now, that's a
Vanguard workout.

233
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,620
Giving up already?

234
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,155
I thought you
weren't a loser.

235
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,156
"Giving up?"

236
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,691
I'd sooner wear a dress!

237
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,060
Alright, sir, what
are your orders now?

238
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,128
Nice.

239
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,463
Let's continue.

240
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,532
Next up, we're
gonna learn about...

241
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,402
the Vanguard slam!

242
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,037
What's a Vanguard slam?

243
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,539
Sounds exactly the same
as what we just did.

244
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,541
The draw is like an
eagle seizing its prey,

245
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,044
but the Vanguard slam is
like an eagle taking its prey

246
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,579
and ripping it in half.

247
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,847
An eagle?

248
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,582
Ah, check it out!

249
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,317
You embarrass
us all, Morikawa!

250
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,418
Huh?

251

not just a bunch

256

playing a card game.

257
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,232
Push‐ups, sit‐ups,
lunges and squats!

258
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,334
I want to see five sets
of each from every one!

this attack is 22,000.

‐Hey, wait.
‐What now?

00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,894
Have you finally
decided to give up?

272
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,795
Never, you've
just forgotten

273
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,631
one of the most important
things in Vanguard.

be missing?

Yeah.

there's nothing more important
than your imagination.

281

want to tell you guys

506
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,778
how much fun we had.

507
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,446
Thank you for inviting us.

508
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,648
I'm so glad you
were all able to come.

509
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,150
Catch you on the flip side.

Next time we
play each other,

511
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,120
it'll be at the
national championship.

512
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,288
Right!

Hey, you guys!

I've got a fun card game
we can play on the way home.

Hmm, they're still just kids.

But they're all working so hard

I have this
really weird feeling

I forgot to do
something this weekend.

522

I just realized I never got
the chance to go swimming!

Oh, Manager, go back!

524
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,497
We need to go
to the beach now.

I‐‐I can't do that.

Shouldn't every

I guess it's about finding
your way to victory,

534
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,148
or having your
opponent play it your way.

Ha, actually that
sounds about right.

536
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,384
Develop your units

537
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,020
and force your play style on
your opponent just like Kai.

538
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,322
Right!

Underground Fights".

Kai's so good, I bet he
has tons of winning images.

541
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,964
I wonder about
that guy sometimes.

542
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,665
It feels like if I
don't watch his back,

543
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,167
he's gonna get
himself into big trouble.
