511
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,674
Way to go, Misaki!

512
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,108
Now let me in there.

513
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,210
What an ending we'll
give this tournament.

514
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,513
The Battle of
Psyqualia is chosen.

515
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,415
Though the outcome is obvious.

516
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,583
I will not use
that power.

517
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,218
I came here today
to face you with

518
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,654
my own strength,
like Kai did.

519
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,256
Then it's as I feared,

520
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,158
this fight will be a bore.

521
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,426
Ren...

522
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,462
Next time,
Two Powers, Side‐by‐Side.

523
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,264
His image,
he's too good.

524
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,599
I don't know if I can
win this by myself.
