Are you his girlfriend?

167
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,310
I wasn't sure when he left us,

168
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,278
but I always knew that
one day he'd come back

169
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,680
and confess his love for me.

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,048
Give it a rest, Nagisa.

171
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,283
You're not my girlfriend
and you never were, okay?

172
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,518
You're so mean.

173
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,819
Just get her off me!

174
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,287
I'm gonna go ahead and assume

175
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,890
that she's the reason he doesn't
wanna join Team Handsome.

176
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,458
Yup, she attached herself to him

177
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,126
like a barnacle on
the hull of a ship.

178
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,027
Yup.

179

mouth kid a lesson

184
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,703

186
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,371
Uh, yeah.

187
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,939
Do you have a younger sister?

188
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,341
Yes.

189
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,909
Then you know where
I'm coming from.

190
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,578
Big brothers will do anything
to make their sisters happy.

191
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,412
Wouldn't you agree?

Uh, yeah, sure.

193
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,782
As far as I'm concerned
there's nothing more important

194
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,551
than keeping Nagisa happy.

195
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,353
And anyone that makes her sad

196
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,088
is gonna feel my wrath.

197
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,323

198
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,193
No way, we're gonna be
together forever, Kamui.

199
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,828
It looks like you're
not getting the message,

200

perfectly clear.

Can't you take a hint?

216

The girl I love has
beautiful eyes, a nice smile,

217

She isn't rude or
pushy like you are

Oh, you kidder.
