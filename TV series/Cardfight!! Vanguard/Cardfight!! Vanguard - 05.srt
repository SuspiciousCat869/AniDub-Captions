Come again?

00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,054
I look up to you
like a brother.

506
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,457
Cause you're one of
the coolest guys I know.

507
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,092
What‐‐what are you‐‐

508
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,196
Please, Brother, you've got
to hang out with me again soon.

509
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,064
I'm not your brother.

510
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,366
Come on, bro,
I'm reaching out here.

511
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,734
Come on!

512
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,938
(screaming)

513
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,005
No way, seriously!

514
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
You're creeping me out!

515
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,041
Don't touch me!

516
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,542
You want a backrub, Brother,
do you, huh, do you?

Brother Aichi, your little
sister is wonderful.

520
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,979
Yeah, but she's
really on top of things

521
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,281
and she gets angry
at me every day.

522
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,616
She yells at you, right?

523
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,251
That would be awesome.

524
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,586
Anyway, you're a
great player, Kamui.

525
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,288
I hope I get more
Grade Three's soon,

526
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,490
so I can fight
on your level.

Next time, "The
Mysterious Card Shop!"

00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,163
Wow, the units are
fighting before our eyes.

529
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,931
Brother,
I‐‐I pictured it.

My future together
with Miss Emi.
