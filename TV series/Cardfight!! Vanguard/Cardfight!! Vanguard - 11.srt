Pretty impressive for
his first tournament.

beat a real Ninja Master?

Oh, you let him get away!

What's the matter?

185
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,006
I was gonna ask the Ninja Master
to make me his disciple.

‐Huh?
‐I had it all planned.

187

He and I were gonna become
a crime‐fighting duo

called The Super Sonic
Ninja Fighters of Doom.

I can't do it alone!

It's okay, maybe you'll
see him again someday.

As if, ninjas only reveal
themselves to attack.

my students over there?

Hey, hey, Mr. Mark.

What a coincidence
bumping into you guys.

195

Are you cats playing in
that tournament today?

196

Oh, totally, this
guy just battled

‐Wow, really?

That's amazing, I would've
loved to see that battle!

Hey, teach, I don't think
I've ever seen you here before.

Uh, yeah, the funniest
thing happened.

201
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,816
I was just in the
neighborhood and I heard

202

there was a card
tournament going on,

203

so I figured why not
check it out, right?

‐You don't say.
‐If you like Vanguard,

205
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,758
then why don't you try
playing it some time?

00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,860
Yeah, not a bad idea.

Wow, seems like you've got
a pretty cool teacher, Aichi.

what're you gonna do with
that bag you're carrying?

This is just a bag of clothes
that I'm donating to charity.

It's certainly not a ninja
costume, 'cause that'd be crazy.

Okay, it's time for our

00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,946
Good going, bro, you've gotten
way stronger since we first met.

503
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,447
Make sure you fight
with confidence

504
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,049
no matter who you're up against.

505
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,352
Thanks, but wait, I'm
fighting you next, Kamui.

506
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,920
All right!

507
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,223
I can't imagine anyone I'd
rather be up against, bro!

508
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,126
Let's fight it out,
bears and bears!

Fair and square?

510
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,331
Next time, Aichi versus Kamui.

I can see it, the path
to victory is before me.
