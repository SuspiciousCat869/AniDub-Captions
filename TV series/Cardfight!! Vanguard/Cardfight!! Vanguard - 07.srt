Damage check.

My trigger check fails.

This is the end.

I'll leave you
alone if you want,

but you'll probably see
me around the card shop,

you again one day.

Since I don't have the skills
to fight you right now,

I'm gonna work really
hard every day to get better,

525
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,420
then one day,
I'll be strong enough,
