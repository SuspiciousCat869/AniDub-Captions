502
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,007
So that's 4,000 for the ability.

503
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,776
And an extra 5,000
for the drive trigger.

504
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,411
‐19,000 power.
‐19,000 power.

505
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,848
Which means that
she's about to beat me.

506
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:25,391
♪

507
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,860
Wow, she just won
her first game ever.

508
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,428
Way to go, Emi!

509
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,629
You're amazing!

510
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,866
A natural, yo.

511
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,468
I'm really proud of you.

512
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,669
That was great.

513
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,472
Aw, thanks, Aichi.

514
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,207
(whimpering)

515
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,843
She stopped the
Morikawa Masher.

516
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,578
But how?

517
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,147
Hey there, are you
gonna be all right?

518
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,883
I should have known my spells
wouldn't win me the game.

519
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,152
This was a battle of
raw talent, after all.

520
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,454
I was wrong to use magic!

521
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,622
Face the facts.

522
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,790
It doesn't work.

523
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,358
You can't just cast
a spell on someone

524
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,393
and make them respect you.

525
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,294
That's weird.

526
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,430
Why would Mr. Wizard lie to me?

527
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,232
Excuse me.

528
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,134
That was a lot of fun.

529
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,170
You were a great teacher,
Mr. Morikawa, thanks.

530
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,438
Uh...

531
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,074
Mister.

532
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,743
(laughing)

533
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,178
What can I say?

534
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,947
I certainly owe a lot to the
teachings of this great book.

535
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,682
I declare you to be
the second graduate

536
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,218
of the Morikawa School.

537
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,154
You call yourself a teacher?

538
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,322
But you're the worst.

539
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,458
Raise your hand, please.

540
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,060
No, we're not in class.

541
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,662
Au contraire.

542
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,631
You know, he is kind
of strong in his own way.

543
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,065
Agreed.

544
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,667
Aichi.

545
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,670
I think next time I
wanna build my own deck.

546
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,472
You should let me
build a deck with you.

547
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,207
I'm great at it.

548
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,942
You know, I've got free time.

549
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,343
How about it?

550
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,445
You wanna enroll in the
Morikawa School of Vanguard

551
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,347
as my third pupil?

552
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,750
Why would I wanna
be your student?

553
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,884
Oh, yes.

554
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,653
My student you will be.

555
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,289
Can you picture it or what?

556
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,391
Show that guy who's boss, Kamui!

557
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,859
Get revenge, yo!

558
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,795
Next time would you mind if I
bring one of my friends along?

559
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,230
Of course not.

560
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,464
The more, the merrier.

561
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,966
So I take it you had fun then?

562
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,101
Mhmm.

563
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,570
Meow.

564
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,973
Stand up, my Vanguard!

565
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,108
Stand up!

566
00:22:26,712 --> 00:23:55,935
♪

567
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,675
Did you have a good time, Emi?

568
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,243
Yeah, it was fun.

569
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,779
But I wonder if
Mr. Morikawa went easy on me.

570
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,148
Um, well, you never know.

571
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,817
Hey, Kamui really wants to
teach you about Vanguard.

572

Why not play him?

573
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,820
I'd rather play against you

574
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,057
when you're not busy getting
ready for the next tournament.

575

Next time, Team Q4 heads
for the regional tournament.

576

The Championship Tournament

577

is finally about to begin.

Huh?
