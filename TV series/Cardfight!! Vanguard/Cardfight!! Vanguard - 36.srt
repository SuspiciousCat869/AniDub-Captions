waiting for Kai to come?

496
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,612
Uh, yeah, I wanted him to see
the deck that I put together.

497
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,547
I thought maybe
we could fight.

498
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,682
Too bad.

499
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,817
You should have
tagged along with me.

500
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,619
What do you mean?

501
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,621
Nothing,
more importantly,

502
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,489
it looks like the shop is
having another tournament.

503
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,692
Yes!

504
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,528
Next time, "The Return
of the Ninja Master".

505
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,697
I'll be picturing my
next shot at Nationals.

506
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,398
Good plan, Aichi.

507
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,267
You made it there once,
now do it again.
