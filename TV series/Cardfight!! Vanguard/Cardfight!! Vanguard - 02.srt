You expect me to believe
that you only gave me

231
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,167
this Blaster Blade card so
that you could bully me later,

232

but if that's the case,

233
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,405
then I don't think this
card would have inspired me

234
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,976

the courage that it did.
