Oh, and how!

334
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:48,466
Our first match
is coming up next.

335
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,068
That means we'll need
to decide on turn order.

336
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,903

Well, if it's all right
with the rest of you.

340
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,250

Yeah, for sure.

You're normally super shy,

346
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,231
but now all of a sudden,
you've got tons of confidence.

347
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,866
It's pretty inspiring!

Bro, get out there
and kick some butt!

Mm‐hmm.

All of our training has
really had an effect on him.

I don't mind
if you go first.

353
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,413
Should be interesting.

354

Well, you heard them, Aichi.

355
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:39,717
This is your
big opportunity.

356
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:40,885
Right!

357
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,320
Then that just leaves the
second and third matches.

358
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,989
I really want to fight!

359
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,123
Is that okay?

360
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:47,324
Yeah.

361
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,960
I'd rather sit back
and watch anyway.

362

You sure?

00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,329
Yeah, I'm sure.

364

You guys can win
this round without me.

365

Trying to look
cool again, huh?

366
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,603
Well, save me
for the third battle.

367
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:01,572
Guess that makes me second.

368
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:02,840
Better be careful, Kai,

369
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,241
or you might not
get a chance to play

370
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,809
in this tournament at all.

371
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,612
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

372
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:12,516
Could you possibly be
more full of yourself?

373
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:16,587
Is he stronger or
is it something else?

374
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:18,455
If Kai's offering to sit out,

375
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:19,857
it must be because
he trusts me

376
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,358
to get the win we need.

377
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:22,426
This is it!

378
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:23,694

starting to see

I'm not as weak
as I was before.

380
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,365
We've got this,
right, Kamui?

381
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:29,466
Misaki?

‐Hmm.
‐You better believe it!

383
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,508
And now it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

384
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,243
The next matchup
features the champions

385
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:42,546
from the last regional
tournament: Team Q4.

386
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:43,814
Alright!

387
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,683
It's finally time.

388
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,618
Q4 rules!

389
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,720
This is gonna be great!

C'mon, Kamui,
you're the greatest!

392
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,594
Q4, yo!

393
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,230
And facing off against
Team Quadrifoglio:

394
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,266
Team Fragrance.

395
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,934
This will be their
debut at Regionals,

396
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:04,969
but from what
I've heard,

397
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,570
they've dominated
their shop tournament

398
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,139
and are focused on making
the finals here today.

399
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,641
Both groups are powerful.

400
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:14,345
Which will win?

401
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,347
This is going
to be classic.

402
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,216
Team Q4 defeated in
the very first round.

403
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,384
Say what?

404
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,252
You must be completely
out of your mind

405
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:24,254
saying something
that brownless!

406
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,689
Groundless.

407
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,125
Alright,
let's calm down.

408
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,593
(grunts)

409
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,696
Hey, I can smell
that from over here.

410
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:34,031
What is that?

411
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,866
It's lavender.

412
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,569
Yes, in our line of work,
it's a well known fact

413
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:41,205
that lavender has a calming
effect on the nerves.

414
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:43,574
The three of us
are perfumers.

415
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,376
You mean performers?

416
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:46,910
Perfumers.

417
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,979
Explains the
spray bottle.

418
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,315
And we all have
expertly trained noses.

419
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:54,351
Able to analyze and
reproduce any aroma.

420
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,020
Bet you didn't know
that every person

421
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,755
has their own unique scent.

422
00:20:57,755 --> 00:21:00,524
And a person's scent changes
based on their emotions,

423
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:04,428
so if you're scared
or angry, we'll smell it.

424
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,429
No way.

425
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,463
Way!

426
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,098
You won't be able
to hide your feelings

427
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,401
and we'll use
that against you.

428
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,103
If we smell fear,
it's time to attack.

429
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:15,739
If we detect confidence,
we'll defend.

430
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:18,542
Now do you see how
hopeless your chances are?

431
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,244
We are gonna beat you.
