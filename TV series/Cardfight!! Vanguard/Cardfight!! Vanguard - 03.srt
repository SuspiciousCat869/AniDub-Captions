176
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,634
Okay, this shop sells TCG,

177
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,538
trading card game
products and such.

178
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,673
What's a trading card game?

179
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,942
Uh, well, they're games
where you collect

180
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,144
different cards and
battle your friends.

181
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,913
As you can see,
once school is over,

182
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,816

Well...yeah?

Hm, if I could
get you interested

your entire school.

190
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,097
Yeah, right.

Sure.

194

The staff generally
hangs around the counter.

If you need anything,
you can talk to them.

popular game right now.
