card from my hand,

505
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,589
I nullify the attack.

506
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,023
Huh?

507
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,326
(whimpers)

508
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,360
Hah!

509
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,295
Misaki's kicking butt.

510
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,164
My final turn.

511
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,067
I attack with Amaterasu
supported by Gemini.

512
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:14,140
I need to draw a heal
trigger or else...

513
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,374
There it is!

514
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,676
Misaki Tokura from Team Q4!

515
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,011
What an impressive win.

516
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,449
With a score of 2‐0,

517
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,885
Team Q4 is the winner.

518
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,387
Whoa.

519
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,055
I think that was
the best I've ever

520
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,457
seen her play.

521
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,491
Wow.

522
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,926
Goddess of the
Full Moon is a force

523
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:34,994
to be reckoned with.

524
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,900
Mom, Dad?

525
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,968
I just want you guys
to know I'm doing okay.

526
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,605
And that when I play Vanguard,

527
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,109
it feels like you're
right here with me.

528
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,277
Hmm.

529
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,547
Thanks to that win,

530
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,749
Team Q4 still has
a chance of moving on

531
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,551
to the final round next week.

532
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,352
There's only
one more match up.

533
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,222
We've gotta make it
to the top of our block.

534
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,657
Huh?

535
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,258
But standing in
their way is a team

536
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,893
with an undefeated
record coming into

537
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,261
this final match up.

538
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,831
It's none other than
last year's champions:

539
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,666
Team Asteroid.

540
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,770

541
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,238

543
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:34,887

That was amazing, Misaki.

545
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,642
Oh, thank you.

546
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,144
Still, it looks like
we've got our work

547
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,378
cut out for us.

548
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,280
Now we're up against
Team Asteroid,

549
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,816
Ren Suzugamori's
handpicked cardfighters.

550
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,518
Well, we've gotta
find a way to beat

551
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,653
these guys and get
Kamui back on the team.

552
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,222
Yeah, let's have Kai
go first again,

553
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,824
then it'll be up
to one of us to get

554
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:19,992
the second win.

555
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,761
Next time,
The Strongest Team, Asteroid!

556
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,029
Right.

557
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,698
We've all got an image
of winning the first game.

558
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,333
Let's all focus on that.
