Oh, don't be silly.

343
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:38,668
He's still your brother
even if he is a champion.

344
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,737
Yeah, after nationals,
things seemed to go back

345
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:44,907
to the way they'd always been.

346
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,709
See ya later!

347
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,011
With one major difference:

348
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:51,547
My Psyqualia,
that mysterious power,

349
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,116
has disappeared.

350
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,986
I haven't felt it once
since the tournament ended.

351
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,791
I'm still not sure exactly why.

352
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,061
Whatever, I'm happy it's gone.

353
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,497
I realize now that I
can be strong on my own,

354
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:10,933
and besides, Psyqualia
made me lose sight

355
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:14,870
of what actually mattered,
the reason I started playing.

356
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,841
Huh?

Sorry.

Kai's been waiting around
to have a game with you

364
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,456
all morning.

No, on second thought,
Kai is a pretty cool dude.

You know what?

I really envy them.

There are probably thousands
of card fights going on all over
