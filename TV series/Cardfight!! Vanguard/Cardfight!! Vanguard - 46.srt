00:21:56,912 --> 00:21:59,548
Q4 and the Brilliant Stars,

499
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:01,317
both are undefeated
up to this point

500
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:04,920
but only one of them can take
the top spot in Block C.

501
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,556
I figured that they
would have a good record.

502
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,358
We've clinched our
spot in the finals,

503
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,527
but those guys are up next,
so just stick to the plan

504
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:14,597
and Aichi can rest.

505
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:23,539
♪

506
00:22:26,676 --> 00:23:56,699
♪

507
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:01,937
What kind of a
creep disguises himself

508
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:03,873
as a little girl
to win a game?

509
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,142
I can't believe you thought
that looked like Emi.

510
00:24:06,142 --> 00:24:07,810
You might want to get
your head examined.

511
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,012
There's no time,
I've got a job to do.

512
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:10,980
Me too.

513
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,348
‐We've got to win this.
‐We've got to win this.

514
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,415
Kai!

515
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,151
I was dreaming again.

516
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:18,354
Why are Kamui and Misaki
doing all the fighting?

517
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:21,957
Next time,
Another Asteroid.

518
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,260
I can hear Ren calling me.

519
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,395
The Brilliant Stars
can't be defeated

520
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:28,831
without you, Aichi.
