161
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,131
Yeah, that'd be great.

162
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,266
I get the feeling that
I've seen you three before.

163
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,502
Ah!

164
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,537
It's Team Caesar!

165
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,507
What're these guys
doing here, Manager?

166
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,709
Actually, they were
the ones that invited us

167
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,178
up to this training camp.

168
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,781
We made a point of watching
you play at the tournament.

169
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,550
We were pretty impressed
with what we saw.

170
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,552
Even though you weren't
able to make it past

171
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,822
the elimination round you were
the only team other than us

172
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,725
that managed to steal a win
away from Team Asteroid.

173
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,995
We thought you showed
a lot of raw talent.

174
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,030
To be honest, we wanted
this training camp to be

175
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,200
a celebration of us becoming
the national champions again.

176
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,070
Unfortunately though, it
didn't turn out that way.

177
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,838
Let's train together,
and next time

178
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,206
we go to the
national tournament,

179
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,075
Team Asteroid won't
know what hit 'em.

It's a dream come true.

he came along with us
