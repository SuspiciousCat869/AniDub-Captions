to play Team Q4?

503
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:52,975
It's been fun, Aichi,

504
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:54,677
but without your PSY Qualia,

505
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:57,780
you don't stand
a chance against us.

506
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,116
(chuckles)

507
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:05,287
I'm gonna enjoy wiping that
ridiculous smile off your face.

508
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:06,922
Once I've destroyed you,

509
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:09,659
I'll be the only
one with this power.

510
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,193
(chuckles)

511
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:23,105
♪

512
00:22:26,642 --> 00:23:56,599

Aichi, our battle was
epic to say the least.

515
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,809
Now it's time for you to
focus on the task at hand,

516
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,910
winning the title.

517
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,278
Don't forget my friends,

518
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:10,813
I wouldn't have
made it without them.

519
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,915
Kamui, Misaki, Kai.

520
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:15,785
Next time, Fateful Showdown.

521
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:17,987
Asteroid may think they're
the best team on Earth,

522
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,322
but I know that
we can beat them.

523
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:23,459
Ren, I understand your
power better than I used to,

524
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:26,662
and I'm gonna return you
to the way you once were.

525
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:27,563
Kai...
