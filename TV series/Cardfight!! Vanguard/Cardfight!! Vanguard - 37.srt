against you, Aichi.

502
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,179
I just always thought you
didn't know how to card fight

503
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,480
cause you never play.

504
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,981
(chuckles)

505
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,349
It's true that
I do like watching

506
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,785
you guys battle
each other,

507
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,922
but Kai didn't get that good
at card fighting by himself.

508
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,692
You catch my drift?

509
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,060
This'll be fun.

Kamui lost to Emi.

514
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,944
I'm not Emi, I'm
the Princess Maiden!

515
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,346
Right,
my apologies, Princess.

516
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,415
And it looks like
I have to play against‐‐

517
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:13,052
Kai's training partner, the
handsome and impressive, Miwa!

518
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,420
Prepare yourself.

519
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,388
Yeah, prepare
if you dare!

520
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,723
(groans)

521
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:20,225
Next time "Miwa's Ability".

522
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,428
So, uh, I don't know
what you're dressed as,

523
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,530
but I can tell
you're really strong.

524
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,332
Oh, I'm strong all right.

525
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,833
Just you wait and see.

526
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,867
