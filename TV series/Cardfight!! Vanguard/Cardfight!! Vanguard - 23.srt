Mr. Wizard's
spell of door opening.

00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,905
Huh?

Ah.

Ren Suzugamori isn't the
national champ for nothin'.

00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,246
I know, I fought Kourin and
she's a really good player.

The nationals are gonna
be full of guys like him.

It'll be hard to keep track

Hey, Misaki's
got a great memory.

515
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,889
That could be a huge
asset for our team.

Yeah, she learned Vanguard
just watching our games.

517
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,860
If she can remember
all those units

518
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,464
it'd be like having a Vanguard
encyclopedia on our side.
