It's your turn.

332
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,634
Right, I'll draw a card.

333
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,302
Then, I'll promote.

334
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,806
Ride Little Sage, Marron!

335
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,409
And call Wingal, too!

337
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,750
Well, it looks like we both
have two units in play.

338
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,318
So are you attacking?

339
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,387
I‐‐I'll attack you.

340
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,855
Okay, then do it.

341
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,958
Turn your Vanguard
to signal the attack.

342
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,394
Then I attack your Bahr
with Little Sage, Marron.

343
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,230
When your Vanguard attacks,
you can increase its power

344
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,633
by supporting it with
one of your rear‐guard.

345
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,635
In that case, I'll
add Wingal's power

346
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,272
to Marron's attack.

347
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,774
When your Vanguard attacks,

348
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,876
you need to reveal the
top card of your deck

349
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,979
and check for
a drive trigger.

350
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,317
Look for a mark in
the upper‐right corner.

351
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,686
If there isn't one,
add it to your hand.

352
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,522
Then, my attack went through?

353
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,358
Uh‐huh.

354
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,392
Okay.

355
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,496
Your attack
overwhelmed my Vanguard.

356
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,799
This is the damage
from that hit.

357
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,702
Now, if you can deal me
five more damage,

358
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,537
then my forces will banish

359
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,272
from the surface
of the planet.

360
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,241
That means I lose.

361
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,642
Does it all make sense?

362
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,710
Uh, yeah.

363

Well, it's good to see
that you're catching on.

372
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,270
I attack Marron with Bahr.

373
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,372
Um, Bahr and Marron both have

374
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,941
the exact same attack
power, so then...

375
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,644
If the power is equal,
the attack goes through.

376
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,712
But if this attack
goes through now,

377
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,914
you'll be able
to hit me again

378
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,550
with the Dragon Knight,
Nehalem afterwards,

379
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,652
and I'll take
two damage, right?

380
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,921
Yes, but you can weaken
your opponent's attack

381
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,324
by defending with the
cards in your hand.

382
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,061
Then, I guard with the
Bringer of Good Luck, Epona.

383
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,796
The number on the
side of the card

384
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,198
becomes your damage shield.

385
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,535
Bahr's power isn't high
enough to break through.

386

My attack has no effect.

387

But now that card
you defended with

388
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:57,043
has to go into the drop zone.

389
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:00,346
