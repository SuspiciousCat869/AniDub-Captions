Hah, I think you mean
pay me back, but thanks.

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,412
First battle, you and me?

Now, let's play some Vanguard!

Is she allowed to
play for those guys?

Gouki, what's the deal?

Weren't you and I supposed
to play each other?

45
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,929
You promised me!

46

That's true, but I'd
gladly break that promise

47

if it meant putting a
smile on my sister's face.

48
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,837
And if she wants to fight you,
I'll do anything in my power

As I was saying,
after weeks of crying,

the training was,

than any of us imagined!

88

I know you're thinking
she's just the alternate,

89
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,000
but she's actually a
full‐fledged member

‐Yeah, I just wanted

Wait, Hiroshi went to
Nationals last year,

96
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,712
so if Nagisa bumped him
to the alternate spot,

you're going with this.

the perfect candidate

for Mr. Morikawa's school
of Vanguard playing.

102
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,693
Yeah, right, she could probably
teach you a few things

103
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,128
about the game.

104
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,063
Hah, that's for sure.

105

But don't ever

Ha ha ha!

If Gouki put her on
Team Handsome,

110
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,974
she must have some serious
card‐fighting skills.

you to fulfill your promise.

488
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,946
Now, let's get married!

489
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,748
Ugh!

490
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:56,816
Oh?

491
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,951
Welcome to the
family, little bro!

492
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,519
No way!

493
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,188
But you promised!

494
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,355
No!

495
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,857
Be a man.

496
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,125
(laughs)

497
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,426
Stay away, I'll never marry you!

498
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,762
Isn't young love
just the cutest?

499
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,964
Aren't they just
the perfect couple?

500
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,933
‐My love!
‐That was the best card fight

501
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,734
I've seen in ages.

502
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,804
Hey, let's make the
next match just as fun!

503
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,739
Uh, okay.

504
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,741
You'll never be
alone again, my love!

505
00:22:26,779 --> 00:23:56,001
♪

506
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,442
Now the pressure's on
me to win my fight.

507
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,477
You've got it, bro,
our future is riding

508
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,913
on the outcome of this match!

509
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,748
But if you lost
to Team Handsome,

510
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,084
then what chance do I
stand against them?

511
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,652
Yeah, you're right.

512
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't know why
I thought we'd wind up

513
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,323
with a happy ending.

514
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,592
Looks like Kai's
going before me.

515
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,895
Next time, Hidden Message.

516
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:25,097
Kai is trying to
tell me something.

517
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,666
Just watch my fight,
and you'll see.
