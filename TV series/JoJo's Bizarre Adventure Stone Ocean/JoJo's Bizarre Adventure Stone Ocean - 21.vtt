The thing F.F. feared most

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.137 position:10% line:89% align:start
was not their body vanishing.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rather, what they found
most frightening of all

00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:21.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
was potentially losing
their intellect

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.015 position:10% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] I remember everything

00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:29.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
since the day I met Jolyne
on the farm.

as well have been yesterday.

The weird scribbles
on the public phones.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fluffed-up blankets

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.926 position:19% line:89% align:start
the stink of the trash.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
The guards screaming
and yelling.

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.064 position:19% line:83% align:start
The sound of the doors
opening and closing.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:45.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hearing the toilet flushing
all day long.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I even remember all
those silly talks

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.169 position:7% line:89% align:start
with Jolyne and everyone else,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
laughing hysterically.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
But still, even though I live
at the farm for many years,

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.845 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't remember
anything from before that.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.447 position:10% line:83% align:start
All I can pull from that time
are robotic thoughts,

almost like recordings.

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.886 position:16% line:89% align:start
I simply followed orders.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
And my task was
to protect Pale Snake's discs

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:09.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
without knowing
or even asking why.

I finally understand now

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:14.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
that living is more
than just being alive.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:17.065 position:16% line:89% align:start
It means making memories.

I'll lose everything.

on behalf of her dad,

help Ermes

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:32.180 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:52.974 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's a priest like you
doing at this prison?

00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:54.809 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it isn't
for anything noble.

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:58.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hush! I'm the one who's asking
the questions. Thank you!

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.815 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see! If I simply take
your memories and read them,

00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:03.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
I would know the nature
of what was born immediately.

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:04.719 position:33% line:89% align:start
[F.F. gasps]

00:08:04.752 --> 00:08:06.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, I would much rather

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:08.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
hear your personal account
of it.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.558 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because saying thing
such as "it was soft,"

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.893 position:10% line:83% align:start
or "it was a strange color,"
or "it was lovely,"

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:14.729 position:38% line:83% align:start
are your
self-generated thoughts,

00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:17.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
and not the memories actually
embedded within your disc.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
I get it.
You're worried that thing

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
is gonna run away
and disappear, huh?

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:22.903 position:7% line:89% align:start
And you would lose it forever.

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? What are you saying?
It's already moved?

00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:27.575 position:16% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Maybe! Who knows?

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:28.943 position:13% line:89% align:start
To be honest, you should be

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
way more worried about it
being killed, much less moved.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:35.082 position:13% line:83% align:start
Actually, I take that back,
it might be dead already.

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:38.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean the guy Jolyne
is with is kind of a dick.

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:40.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know he'd kill it
if he thought it was dangerous.

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.590 position:33% line:83% align:start
Killing it is
not only difficult,

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:44.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's quite impossible.
There is no way!

00:08:46.327 --> 00:08:47.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
It possesses far too
much power

00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:49.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
and strength to fall prey
to that.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.965 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's indestructible.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
My concern is that
Jolyne will get sidetracked

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.736 position:21% line:83% align:start
to do something rash
and lose sight of it.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only Jotaro's memories can
control what has been born.

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.107 position:21% line:89% align:start
That is what matters.

00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:03.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I have those memories
in my clutches now.

00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:05.079 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have finally come
to the point

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.247 position:13% line:89% align:start
where we're one step away.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.815 position:7% line:89% align:start
What was his bodily form like?

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:09.350 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did it develop quickly?

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:11.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did it show response
to stimuli?

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.589 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought if it hit the water,
it would drown.

00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:18.759 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh, what else?
Yeah, I don't quite remember.

00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:20.194 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ugh, okay, well... It's...

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's stalling for time!
Quick! Behind you!

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:25.599 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.436 position:21% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Hah, I did it!

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:30.471 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, by the way,
F.F.'s intellect,

00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:32.973 position:13% line:83% align:start
its control tower's nowhere
near here.

00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.642 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's that way!

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.111 position:33% line:83% align:start
Even better,
I've got water now!

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.313 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which means I can go
and tell Jolyne all of it.

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:47.288 position:35% line:89% align:start
[trilling]

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.291 position:24% line:89% align:start
Intellect, you say?

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:53.394 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're not the one who decides
where your intellect is.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.596 position:24% line:83% align:start
These powers belong
to someone else.

00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:57.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
In fact, it's the one
who graciously

00:09:57.498 --> 00:09:59.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
gave you
your Stand power with a disc.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:09:59.667 position:47% line:89% align:start
Me!

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:03.671 position:24% line:83% align:start

sentient bag of plankton! You're
explaining things to me

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
with unearned triumph
and arrogance?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.341 position:33% line:89% align:start
How dare you!

feels like it's burning away.

00:10:18.553 --> 00:10:20.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
Something's wrong here.
Is this even water?

00:10:20.688 --> 00:10:22.690 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the hell
is coming out of there?

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:24.992 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groans]
You, son of a...

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:27.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, of course it's water.
But it's boiling.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
The highest temperature
all aquatic life on Earth

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:33.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
can withstand safely is
about 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:36.837 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have placed a different Stand
power that can boil water...

00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.706 position:7% line:89% align:start
...conveniently into this one.

So I repeat myself.

I'm the only one who can decide
where your intellect is.

Any water you touch henceforth

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:48.082 position:16% line:83% align:start
is instantly and reliably
going to boil with your power.

Ah, hell!
Could it have drowned?

No, look!

That thing has will?

If it's running away,
that must mean...

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:48.209 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] No!

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:50.044 position:19% line:83% align:start
It might just be moving
by sentient instinct.

what it is,

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:56.150 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I have to stop it now.

[Anastasia] Listen!
Don't take another step.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.905 position:13% line:89% align:start
Turn around and look at me.

it! I said you can't
get too close to it, remember?

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:36.757 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:41.195 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Anastasia, look at you!

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.797 position:10% line:83% align:start
What happened to your height?
You're like so tiny now.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:44.765 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ugh...

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.773 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Anastasia, talk to me!
-Try to calm down, Jolyne.

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:55.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
By the way, how big

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:58.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
is everything looking
from your perspective?

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, it's normal.
The same as earlier.

00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:04.084 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hate to say,

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:06.887 position:13% line:83% align:start
it looks like the only one
who shrank was you, Anastasia.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:10.592 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] The baby looks
completely normal size

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:12.793 position:21% line:89% align:start
from where I am, too.

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
But only the rock
that turned over became small.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.600 position:33% line:83% align:start
Listen to me!
Do not move from that spot.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:19.800 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stay right where you are.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.642 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hmm, you're back
to your own size.

00:13:27.676 --> 00:13:30.844 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess that means that's
what this baby's powers can do.

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:32.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
In other words, when
we get too close to the baby,

00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:35.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
then boom, we shrink
to a fraction of our real size.

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:37.686 position:19% line:89% align:start
I really have no idea.

00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.587 position:30% line:83% align:start
Those questions
are quite hard to answer.

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look! If I get half
this distance towards the baby,

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:47.194 position:21% line:83% align:start
my height accordingly
gets cut in half.

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.531 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then, of course,
I have to walk twice as far.

00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:50.699 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uhm. Furthermore,

00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:53.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
if I get
a quarter of the way to it,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
then the walk distance is
multiplied by four.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.137 position:7% line:89% align:start
Likewise, an eighth of the way

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.172 position:33% line:83% align:start
will make it
eight times farther.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:13:59.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps softly]

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
One thirty-second.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:02.976 position:27% line:89% align:start
One sixty-fourth.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:04.978 position:7% line:89% align:start
One one hundred twenty-eighth.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:08.215 position:27% line:83% align:start
If my body keeps
getting smaller,

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.184 position:27% line:83% align:start

You're never going

Oh, no! I think
this Stand came out

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:30.792 position:10% line:89% align:start
just so it could pull me in,

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.192 position:10% line:89% align:start

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:44.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I'll just have to
catch the Stand.

haven't you seen it yet?

I know I took a risk.

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:06.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
But that baby has intellect
and curiosity. Clearly.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.248 position:21% line:83% align:start
It touched the bottle

I saw that anything
it touches won't change size.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:15.123 position:19% line:83% align:start

We've gotten to the bottle.

Anastasia, w-what had happened?

[gasps]

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:14.242 position:7% line:89% align:start
And why am I holding the baby?

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.110 position:13% line:89% align:start
For real, what's going on?

00:21:16.144 --> 00:21:18.746 position:24% line:83% align:start
It seems this thing
is very interested

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the star-shaped birthmark
on your left shoulder.

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:22.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will even call it fixated.

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:25.418 position:7% line:89% align:start
Something about it touching you

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:28.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
has enabled us to return
to our original size.

And if you haven't noticed,

00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:34.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
it has the same birthmark
in its shoulder, too.

00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:36.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] What is this thing?

00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:40.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
Apparently, it's known
Jolyne since before.

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:43.104 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, so, uh,
I think this little goblin

00:21:43.137 --> 00:21:45.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
might be getting kind of
attached to me.

00:21:45.273 --> 00:21:47.340 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hm, what should I do?

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:49.610 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
It's bonding. Not good!

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.046 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's no doubt in due time,

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
this child will become
her enemy.

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:56.349 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I feel from this baby's
powers

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:58.351 position:33% line:83% align:start
is menace and
infinite darkness.

00:21:59.654 --> 00:22:01.155 position:16% line:83% align:start
We might need this thing
to get back

00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:03.456 position:30% line:83% align:start
your dad's disc
from Pale Snake,

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.760 position:35% line:83% align:start
and I know
how important that is.

00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:08.663 position:33% line:83% align:start
But honestly,
we may have to kill it now.
