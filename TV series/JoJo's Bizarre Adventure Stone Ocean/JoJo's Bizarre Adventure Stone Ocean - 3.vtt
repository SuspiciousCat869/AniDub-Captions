[judge] And so,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
defendant Jolyne Cujoh
is sentenced.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:11.546 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're one interesting chica.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
How'd you end up here?
What are you in for?

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I'm innocent.
-[gavel banging]

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.119 position:19% line:83% align:start
...to 15 years in Green
Dolphin Street State Prison,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
where she will remain under
the watchful eye

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.423 position:27% line:83% align:start
of strict guards
to pay for her crimes.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.093 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] What the hell is
going on here?

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.929 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Gwess] I wasn't expecting you

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.496 position:16% line:89% align:start
to also have an ability.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
It'll be Stone Ocean.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because somehow,
I'm gonna free myself

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.102 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the sea of stone.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.304 position:10% line:89% align:start
[opening theme song playing]

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Stone Ocean.

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:22.309 position:13% line:83% align:start
While in it's thread form,
it can travel far distances,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it lacks power and
s easily damaged.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
[electricity buzzing]

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
It becomes strong
when gathered.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, it can only reach
about two meters

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:32.687 position:30% line:89% align:start
in that state.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:37.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
Could Stone Ocean break
through the iron bars?

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.627 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, that's not gonna happen.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:42.429 position:13% line:89% align:start
The most it could do was...

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.330 position:41% line:89% align:start
[bang]

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
My soul energy that
was brought out

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.671 position:21% line:89% align:start
by the pendant stone.

00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:52.305 position:21% line:83% align:start
Escaping prison with
this power is...

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:53.675 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
...not possible yet.

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:58.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
Before I try that, I need
a better understanding

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.180 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the entire prison's layout.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.916 position:5% line:89% align:start
[woman] Hey, girl with the buns.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.918 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hello? I'm talking to you.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.053 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry to bug,

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you got some
spare change I can borrow?

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:08.488 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have some if
I go back to my cell,

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the call I'm on
is about to run out.

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll go get it and
pay you back when I'm done.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:14.862 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think you could maybe
lend me a dollar?

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:15.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's been a while

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:18.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
since I've last talked
to my family.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[rustling]
-Sure, I guess.

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:21.401 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, thanks so much.
You're my hero.

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.272 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll return it once I'm done.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.341 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[woman] Move it!
-[grunts]

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
The hell do you think
you're doing?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.179 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't you know there's a line?

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.412 position:35% line:89% align:start
What line?

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been standing behind
that girl for 30 minutes

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.250 position:16% line:83% align:start
waiting for her to finish
that ridiculously long call!

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.153 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're the one
who wasn't in line!

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:41.254 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dumbass! You gotta be new.

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.725 position:10% line:83% align:start
You gotta make a reservation
to use the phones here.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.193 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, that's news to me!

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.227 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well,
remember it next time.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.031 position:21% line:83% align:start
By the way, the wait
is usually a month long.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, seriously?!

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:54.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's only supposed to be
a few minutes per phone call,

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
so how does the wait
become a month long?

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just another one
of the seven wonders, honey.

00:03:58.673 --> 00:03:59.640 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, you.

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let me get your place
in line, would you?

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:02.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
[woman chuckles]

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.747 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's why
we do things this way, got it?

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.086 position:10% line:83% align:start
[woman over phone] Hey, Mama.
-[pensive exhale]

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.487 position:27% line:89% align:start
I wanna call her.

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:15.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanna hear her voice.
Mama's voice...

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.792 position:38% line:89% align:start
Jo-lyne!

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:19.527 position:16% line:89% align:start
How you doing, "cellie"?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.729 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shut up and get
the hell away from me!

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:22.597 position:35% line:89% align:start
I told you,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
we're finished talking
to each other!

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on, you can't
possibly hate me forever.

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:29.302 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm only here to warn you.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.605 position:10% line:89% align:start
Believe me, what you just did

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
was the worst move
you could've made.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:33.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:36.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
You just lent a dollar
to that blonde girl, right?

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.913 position:33% line:83% align:start
Go make sure
she returns it right away.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.081 position:41% line:89% align:start
Trust.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
There'll be hell to pay
you don't get that money back.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.851 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you saying?

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:45.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course I'm gonna
have her return it.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's just a dollar.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.390 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ugh, hey! That is
what I'm talking about!

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
It ain't "just a dollar"!

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:53.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
That kind of thinking
will get you killed.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:54.896 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, listen to me, Jolyne.

00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
One thing you need to learn

00:04:58.465 --> 00:04:59.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
is that lending and
borrowing money

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
with other prisoners is
an absolute no-no.

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.237 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's something
you should never do

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:04.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
in the Aquarium.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.840 position:13% line:89% align:start
Even if it's just a dollar.

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:07.642 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tell me, what do you
think would happen

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:09.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you were unable
to get that dollar back

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the blonde who
begged you for it?

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:12.412 position:38% line:89% align:start
Any idea?

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:14.916 position:19% line:89% align:start
You'd become like her.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:15.750 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasp of pain]

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.320 position:27% line:83% align:start
Word would spread
around the place

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.421 position:13% line:89% align:start
that the newcomer, Jolyne,

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.422 position:19% line:89% align:start
couldn't even get back

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:23.825 position:33% line:83% align:start
a mere dollar
that she lent out.

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:27.327 position:33% line:83% align:start
And in here,
rumors spread like wildfire.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
They'll keep coming back
for more, just like her.

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:33.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
One after another,
every single day...

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:35.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you run out of money,
they'll just take everything

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.737 position:16% line:89% align:start
from your body and mind.

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:38.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't know about you,
but that sure does sound

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
like a living hell to me.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, wait a minute.
You're exaggerating.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.778 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that what you think?

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.479 position:33% line:83% align:start
Look at her.
She lent just a dollar too.

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
Speaking of the blonde,
there she is now.

00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:50.417 position:13% line:89% align:start
She went back to her room,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.519 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it looks like
she's got no intention

00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:53.054 position:13% line:89% align:start
of coming to pay her debt.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:54.288 position:38% line:89% align:start
Trust me.

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:56.624 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everything I've said
has been for your sake.

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:01.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
[door buzzing]

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:10.370 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hi. You got a spare minute?

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.540 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey!
Yeah, I'm just reading.

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:14.809 position:35% line:83% align:start
Apparently,
this book's a masterpiece.

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:15.710 position:27% line:89% align:start
Have you read it?

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:17.612 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nuh-uh.

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:19.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway, about that change
I lent...

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.315 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um... I, uh--

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.117 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was wondering
what happened to it.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.652 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! Of course, hon!

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.154 position:35% line:83% align:start
One dollar.
There's no way I'd forget it.

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've got the memory stored
in the old noggin' right here.

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:32.526 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll get it to you later, okay?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
You told me that you have
some back in your cell.

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:37.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
You went back, right?
So, where is it?

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:40.201 position:30% line:83% align:start
Enough already!
Don't you ever shut up?

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.636 position:27% line:83% align:start

Contrary to what

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:12.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
the person who framed you

isn't your boyfriend Romeo.

[gasps]

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.719 position:33% line:89% align:start
Johngalli A.

00:15:17.752 --> 00:15:18.887 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's currently locked up

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:21.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the men's section
of this penitentiary.

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:23.390 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's a veteran and
a sniper who supposedly

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:25.025 position:19% line:83% align:start
could nail his targets
through wind speeds

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:26.661 position:16% line:89% align:start
of 20 meters per second.

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:28.162 position:38% line:83% align:start
According
to an investigation,

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
his cataracts have caused
his vision

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:31.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
to degrade considerably.

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.535 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's the one
who plotted everything.

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:35.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
Even that car accident.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.039 position:16% line:83% align:start
Apparently, Johngalli A.
had his henchmen

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:40.307 position:35% line:83% align:start
abduct some
random hitchhiker

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.242 position:33% line:83% align:start
and throw him
in front of the car.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.246 position:19% line:83% align:start
Everything from hiring
the money-grubbing lawyer,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.649 position:10% line:89% align:start
the judge that sentenced you,

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:49.082 position:30% line:83% align:start
and setting up
that rich brat

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.686 position:30% line:83% align:start
were all orders
from Johngalli A.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:32.125 position:10% line:89% align:start
By putting you in this jail,

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:34.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
he can dispose of you
at any time that he wants.

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:35.763 position:30% line:89% align:start
But why though?

00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:38.833 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because of the blood that's
running through your veins.

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:41.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
The blood of the Joestars.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
[uncertain exhale] Joestars?

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:46.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
The family name that
connects back to us

00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.408 position:10% line:89% align:start
from a few hundred years ago.

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.078 position:13% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. holds a grudge
toward this blood.

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:52.947 position:33% line:83% align:start
To be able to
communicate something

00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:55.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
to someone's heart
is a wonderful thing.

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:57.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
But sometimes remnants
are left over,

00:16:57.619 --> 00:17:00.254 position:24% line:83% align:start
and those remnants
are known as grudges.

[exhales]

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:02.590 position:16% line:89% align:start
Back when I was younger,

00:17:02.624 --> 00:17:03.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
I kicked the ass

00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:06.460 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the Joestar bloodline's
greatest enemy.

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:08.596 position:27% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. was
that man's subordinate.

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
He never met him in person,

00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:13.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I've got no doubt
that they're connected.

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:14.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even though 20 years
have passed,

00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:16.804 position:16% line:83% align:start
the blind bastard turned
his fanaticism

00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.138 position:10% line:89% align:start
into a motive for his grudge.

00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:19.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
This makes no sense.

00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.676 position:13% line:83% align:start

to be some kind of scholar.

What's all this about "enemies"
and "grudges"?

00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:25.412 position:13% line:89% align:start
All you need to understand

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:27.281 position:21% line:83% align:start
is that you're being
targeted right now,

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:38.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the first place.

00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:40.487 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:18:40.521 --> 00:18:43.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jolyne! Get away from
that door now!

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.157 position:27% line:89% align:start
[grunts in pain]

[coughing]

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:11.351 position:30% line:83% align:start
What the fuck?
Did I just get shot?

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.688 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't move!
He's begun his assault.

00:19:14.922 --> 00:19:16.557 position:21% line:89% align:start
[tense music playing]

00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:20.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
What does the far right
of this hallway look like?

00:19:20.862 --> 00:19:22.130 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are there any windows?

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.731 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Two or three,

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:25.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
but all of them have
iron bars on them.

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.102 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jotaro]
This bullet's the real deal.

00:19:28.136 --> 00:19:29.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a sniper round
used primarily

00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:31.139 position:21% line:89% align:start
in long range rifles.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. definitely
fired this round.

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:34.876 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait just a second.

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:37.512 position:27% line:83% align:start
You said that guy
was an inmate in this prison.

00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
We aren't even allowed
to have pens in here.

00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:42.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is that right?
Rifles come in parts.

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:44.284 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you divide the pieces,

00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:46.353 position:27% line:83% align:start
you can hide them
in anything.

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:48.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
If a subordinate bribes
the guards,

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.289 position:24% line:83% align:start
they'll most likely
allow the items

00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:51.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
in without inspection.

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
Slowly but surely, you'll
have the whole damn thing.

00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:56.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure that's true, but
this is the women's prison!

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.533 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no way he can aim
from the men's side.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Especially inside a building
like this

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
with so many obstacles.

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:04.304 position:24% line:83% align:start
He can with a rifle
and a special power...

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.439 position:30% line:89% align:start
In other words,

00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:07.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. is definitely
a Stand user.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:09.711 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look there.

00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:11.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

-[whoosh]
-[gasps]

00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:25.026 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't show your face too much.

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:27.795 position:16% line:83% align:start
It looks like that's more
than just a piece of trash.

00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:29.630 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but it's moving away.

00:20:29.664 --> 00:20:33.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems really light.
Like it's dancing in the wind.

00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:34.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jotaro] Don't make
any sudden moves.

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:35.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
Before we do anything,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
we need to determine
that thing's power.

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:42.309 position:33% line:89% align:start
It dodged it!

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
What did I just say?

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:45.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can it see my thread
or something?

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:47.280 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stop raising your voice.

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:49.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's reacting to
something else.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not the movement
of your thread.

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:53.755 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's going in a completely
different direction.

00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:54.756 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:57.390 position:27% line:83% align:start
So does that mean
it's reacting to that thing?

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:57.759 position:21% line:89% align:start
What do you call it?

00:20:58.059 --> 00:20:59.326 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know,

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
the stuff that the thread's
movements created.

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.598 position:13% line:89% align:start
Um... the movement of air?

00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:05.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jotaro] So it was reacting
to the air currents

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to predict
our location.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:10.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Even if he knew
the location,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
how did he shoot
a real bullet

00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:13.241 position:7% line:89% align:start
from the men's prison to here?

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's what I want to know.

00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:17.211 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jolyne. You survived
that shot from earlier

00:21:17.245 --> 00:21:19.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
due to pure luck
and coincidence.

00:21:19.547 --> 00:21:21.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't move until we know
the mechanism of the snipes.

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:22.683 position:38% line:89% align:start
We clear?

00:21:22.717 --> 00:21:25.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't order me around
like I'm just a stupid child.

how much trouble you're in

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.531 position:10% line:83% align:start

Do you, Jolyne Cujoh?

[whoosh]

Here it comes!
It's reacting to him!

I'm gonna make sure you rot
in solitary confinement!

I'm gonna enjoy

Just calm down!

Jolyne, don't move away
from the wall.

00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.283 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know that.
Stop ordering me around!
