What the hell
you doing over there?

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cut that shit out!
It's annoying!

[sighs] It's all over.
I'm finished.

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn that male prison guard.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.527 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why'd he have to see me?

I can't... I can't live

[woman] Come on,
tell me what happened.

While you're at it,
what's your name again?

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:16.611 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, it's Jo... something.

00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:19.279 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jolyne! That's it, right?

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:20.848 position:21% line:89% align:start
What'd he see anyway?

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, like... well, basically...
He, um...

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.656 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, it's a word that
starts with "M."

Huh?

I can't hear you!

Wait... Are you kidding me?

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.777 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] I'll never get married!

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:52.412 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did you just say
a guard saw you masturbating?

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
So he caught you flicking
the bean, huh?

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:59.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] Tell me,
which guard was it, huh?

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] I woke up at dawn
this morning,

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I was looking at
the shape

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the bars on the window.

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:09.530 position:21% line:83% align:start
And the moonlight was
shining through just right,

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:12.199 position:30% line:89% align:start
so, I... um...

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.402 position:16% line:89% align:start
I started getting horny.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.705 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then, uh... well, you know...

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:20.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
But when I looked up
from my bed,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
I saw him standing there.

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:24.344 position:19% line:83% align:start
You probably know him.
He's the youngest guard here.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:27.548 position:10% line:83% align:start
He was just standing outside
of my cell watching me.

00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:30.084 position:21% line:83% align:start
The look on his face
was sickening.

00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:31.485 position:19% line:89% align:start
It made me want to die!

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
[wailing] I just want
to end it all now!

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.023 position:30% line:89% align:start
Damn, for real?

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:37.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I know him.
He's a real handsome guy.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.560 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh my god.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:42.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
So tell me. How much
did our peeping Tom see?

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.966 position:35% line:83% align:start
Know what?
I'm just gonna ask straight up.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
Where were your panties?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
They weren't at your ankles,
were they?

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:49.604 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is that something
you really need to know?

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:51.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
And there's no way
I'd tell you.

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:54.108 position:10% line:89% align:start
Anyway, I've already decided.

00:02:54.142 --> 00:02:55.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
Until the day I die,

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:58.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't even think
about masturbating again.

00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:00.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
I swear on my life!

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.448 position:33% line:89% align:start
-Yeah, sure.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
-We'll see about that.
-[cackling]

How the hell do
you get horny

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.087 position:30% line:83% align:start
from looking at
iron bars like that?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.487 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're into freaky shit,
ain't you?

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.222 position:27% line:83% align:start
Shut your mouth,
you nosy skank!

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.125 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mind your own business
instead of eavesdropping

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
and judging people
you don't know!

It ain't like you've never
done it before!

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
[scoffs] I don't think
about doing pervy stuff

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
like you two hoes. [chuckles]

Who the hell are you anyway?

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:22.904 position:33% line:83% align:start
Back that up.
Bet I'll last longer.

You clod! The hell kind
of bet would that be?

Masturbating is

you keep to yourself,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.546 position:19% line:83% align:start

to prove you didn't do it, huh?

If I said I could tell
by your left ring finger,

00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:38.318 position:33% line:83% align:start
what exactly
would you do then?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.320 position:16% line:89% align:start
You were brought in here

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.190 position:13% line:83% align:start
for something sex-related,
weren't you?

In an orderly fashion,
stand up

outside of the window.

for stealing a vehicle,

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.751 position:35% line:83% align:start
as well as
running someone over.

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:46.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
Given your history
of two previous thefts,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
your bail definitely
won't be approved.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.991 position:21% line:89% align:start
In other words, Jojo,

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:51.424 position:33% line:83% align:start
you will now
be transferred

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
to Green Dolphin Prison's
Custody Jail

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:54.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
to be tried for your crimes.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:56.597 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to get ready
for a trial.

00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:59.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't call me Jojo,
you hear?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
Only my mother
calls me that.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.303 position:38% line:83% align:start
Besides,
you're talking about history,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.740 position:27% line:83% align:start
but all I did was
borrow a motorcycle for a bit.

00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:08.308 position:10% line:83% align:start
And what does it even matter?
I was 14!

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
All that matters
is that I'm innocent here!

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:12.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
You better defend me
with your life.

00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:14.115 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're not cheap, you know?

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:15.315 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course I will.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.819 position:16% line:83% align:start
For the sake of the law,
I'll try my best.

Jeez.

coming to visit?

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:25.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's probably bawling
her eyes out.

00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:26.727 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's bummed to be sure,

00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:29.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
but more than anything,
she's worried for you.

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:31.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've brought
some things for her.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
You won't be wearing
your prison uniform

during your trial, of course.

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:37.370 position:21% line:83% align:start
So there you'll find
a change of clothes,

as well as some vitamins,

give this to you

Keep it down now!

why are you bringing up
my deadbeat dad?

00:06:20.348 --> 00:06:21.682 position:27% line:89% align:start
If you must know,

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:24.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
your mother has no way of
getting ahold of your father.

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.861 position:13% line:89% align:start
he's been hard to pin down.

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
We last got word
that he's conducting research

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:37.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
somewhere in Africa,
so it's taking a while

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.966 position:27% line:89% align:start
to call him over.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's the point of trying?
It's not like he'd come.

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:43.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
That prick's never here.

00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:45.006 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.540 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not for that kind of guy.

at Green Dolphin Prison's

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, didn't you say
you were innocent earlier?

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.039 position:27% line:89% align:start
[stiffly exhales]

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:21.275 position:13% line:83% align:start
It might be a custody jail,
but it's still established

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:23.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
in Green Dolphin Prison,
after all.

If you're being transferred
there, you might--

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:27.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
After the trial,
it'll all be clear.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.151 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
I'm gonna be sent to prison.

[muffled male voice]
Yeah.

00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:32.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wwe're coming up
on the bridge now.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.689 position:21% line:83% align:start
We should be arriving
in about ten minutes.

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:36.724 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're already there, huh?

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:38.458 position:38% line:83% align:start
They said
we'll be arriving soon.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? What are you
talking about?

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't you just hear
the driver?

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's impossible.
Of course not.

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're going to be crossing

We'll reach the prison

Huh?

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:52.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
How'd you know
he was gonna say that?

00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:55.543 position:30% line:83% align:start
Another of your
fortune-telling skills?

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:58.546 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm not sure.
Why was I able to hear him?

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a mystery to me too.

Oh, my. You're a funny girl.

Anyway,
the name's Ermes Costello.

I got caught robbing

00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:09.290 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's my second time,

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
so they're throwing me
in the slammer.

Hey, Jolyne.

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.668 position:33% line:83% align:start
Did you bring
any cash along with you?

00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:56.771 position:38% line:89% align:start
Possibly.

Hey, hey.
I'm only trying to warn you.

If you don't walk
into that place

things ain't gonna
work out too well.

Good luck if your pockets
are empty though.

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:09.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have to
watch your back

until you get someone
to bring you some.

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:11.886 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.587 position:35% line:83% align:start
I told you
I'm not going to prison,

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:15.289 position:16% line:89% align:start
so why do you even care?

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.824 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, best to be prepared.

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.660 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, it's not like
you have any money either.

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:22.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you did, they would've
found it during the pat down.

00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:23.364 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're naive, Jolyne.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's lots of ways to
sneak money past the guards.

Don't tell me
you rolled it up

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:28.702 position:16% line:89% align:start
and stuck it up your ass

Are you dumb?

That's a rookie move.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
They check those kind
of places right away.

The stitch is small, right?

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
It'll bleed a little
when I take it out,

Jolyne, you should know.

00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:49.911 position:19% line:83% align:start
The prosecutors believe
that you stole the car

and crashed it

who reported the theft.

All right, then let's do this.

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:12.065 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, have you ever heard
of "plea bargaining" before?

00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:13.668 position:35% line:89% align:start
Basically,

00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:16.103 position:16% line:83% align:start
it means the prosecutors
will ignore the DUI

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
as long as you admit
to all the other charges.

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:19.641 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you take the deal,

00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:22.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
you'll only be charged with
theft and accidental homicide

00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:24.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
with a suspended sentence
of about a year or two.

00:17:24.812 --> 00:17:26.514 position:30% line:89% align:start
What did I say?

00:17:26.548 --> 00:17:28.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
I told you to defend me
with your life!

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.717 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm innocent!

Yes, I know.

00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:33.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that is the deal
that they're offering you.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.488 position:33% line:83% align:start
If at trial,
they deem you guilty,

00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.524 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll be locked up
for five years at least.

00:17:36.558 --> 00:17:39.059 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're running
out of time, Jolyne.

00:17:39.092 --> 00:17:41.763 position:10% line:83% align:start
The trial is happening soon,
so you need to decide

00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you're taking
a bargain or not.

00:17:43.965 --> 00:17:45.098 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gavel slamming]

00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:47.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
Defendant Cujoh.

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.671 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you understand
all of the details

00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:51.005 position:27% line:83% align:start
of the presented
plea bargain

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
and approve of it
without reservation?

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.510 position:19% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Yes, I approve.

00:17:55.543 --> 00:17:56.578 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:17:56.611 --> 00:17:59.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
This court will take into
account that defendant,

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:01.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jolyne Cujoh has
pled guilty on all charges,

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:03.083 position:24% line:83% align:start
and given the fact
the said offense

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:04.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
was not premeditated,

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.054 position:33% line:83% align:start
we will also
be considering room

00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
for the extenuating
circumstance.

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, this court cannot
forgive the act

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:11.993 position:30% line:83% align:start
of deliberately
killing the victim,

00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:13.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
who was still alive,

00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
by proceeding to throw him
into swamp land

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:17.164 position:21% line:83% align:start
in order to cover up
the evidence.

00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:19.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you mean
he was still alive?

00:18:19.534 --> 00:18:20.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that true?

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:23.103 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, what is
this old guy saying?

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:24.839 position:21% line:89% align:start
Deliberately killing?

-[tense music playing]
-[long sigh]

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:35.917 position:7% line:83% align:start
And so, defendant Jolyne Cujoh
is sentenced to 15 years

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
in Green Dolphin Street
State Prison,

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
where she will remain

00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:41.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
under the watchful eye
of strict guards

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:42.222 position:19% line:89% align:start
to pay for her crimes.

-[gasps]
-[judge] Court adjourned.

00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:46.794 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hold on. This can't be....

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:48.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
Seriously? Fifteen years?

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.066 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I bargained
like you told me to.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.936 position:16% line:83% align:start
I admitted to the crimes,
didn't I? [panting]

00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:57.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mr. Lawyer?

00:18:57.237 --> 00:18:59.607 position:30% line:83% align:start
I defended you
the best that I could.

00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.009 position:21% line:89% align:start
My work's done here.

00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:02.910 position:21% line:83% align:start
You stay healthy now,
Jolyne Cujoh.

00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:04.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?

00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:05.880 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get back here!

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:07.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can't be serious!

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.117 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm facing 15 whole years?

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.417 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's not what you said!

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.786 position:41% line:83% align:start
[guard]
Quit your squirming now!

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:13.087 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:14.722 position:33% line:89% align:start
You bastard!

00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:19.326 position:38% line:83% align:start
[lawyer]
You can breathe easy now.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.461 position:33% line:83% align:start
The sentence
has been determined.

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:22.664 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks to the plea bargain,

00:19:22.697 --> 00:19:25.566 position:27% line:83% align:start
she won't be able
to appeal to a higher court.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.235 position:19% line:83% align:start
And this case will have
no further investigations.

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.203 position:19% line:89% align:start
Congratulations, Romeo.

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:33.206 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thank you, sir.
You really saved my ass here.

Don't mention it.

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:38.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can thank your wealthy
father for lining my pockets.

Listen up, prisoner!

In addition to the name
you got from the parent

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:17.985 position:30% line:83% align:start
that gave birth
to your sorry ass,

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:19.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
you'll be given
a welcome number

that the state
has appointed to you.

you're sitting on the shitter,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.500 position:27% line:89% align:start
you will respond!

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:40.842 position:24% line:83% align:start
we will now conduct
a full body search.

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.476 position:24% line:89% align:start
Remove all clothing

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
and place everything
into the tray in front of you.

the trash a lesson from
the beginning

00:20:51.152 --> 00:20:52.920 position:24% line:83% align:start

including your panties!

You want me to be
on all fours or no?

be better?

The AC works well in there.

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:36.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
That won't be necessary.

00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:38.331 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since the documents

This heat is nothing compared

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.506 position:27% line:83% align:start
to what my client
has been through.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.209 position:30% line:83% align:start
Fifteen years.
And still so young.

00:21:48.242 --> 00:21:49.811 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the lack of my ability.

A moment ago, Jolyne Cujoh

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:58.219 position:27% line:83% align:start
gave me a letter
addressed to you

00:21:58.252 --> 00:21:59.921 position:33% line:83% align:start
and asked me
to pass it along.

Pass this on to him too.

00:22:19.307 --> 00:22:20.373 position:30% line:89% align:start
[lawyer] What?

00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
You might be out of
my reach right now,

I'm waiting 15 years.

00:22:30.518 --> 00:22:31.953 position:19% line:89% align:start

is one of the worst parts

00:22:57.044 --> 00:22:58.378 position:27% line:89% align:start
[coughs] My neck.

00:22:58.411 --> 00:23:01.448 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's something...
thread-like is strangling me.

00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.085 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is it the damn AC
that's drying out my throat?

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:08.155 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and turn off already!

[brakes screech]

[Jolyne] So I can use it
like this too, huh?

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:26.073 position:33% line:83% align:start
It reacts to
my thoughts and feelings,

00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:29.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I can control it
with the strength of my will.

00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:32.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
I understand why
he gave me the pendant.

00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:34.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I can protect myself.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, my.
This is going to be fun.
