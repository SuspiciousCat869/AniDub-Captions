00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Pale Snake] All right,
Sports Maximum.

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:51.913 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen carefully.

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:54.448 position:38% line:83% align:start
On Earth,
much akin to how the ratio

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.217 position:24% line:83% align:start
of water to land is
seven parts to three,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
the souls of living things
have a perfect set amount.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:03.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's crucial to maintain
the balance of things.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:06.060 position:27% line:83% align:start
As the population
of Earth increases,

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:08.029 position:16% line:83% align:start
it wouldn't be a mistake
to assume that

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:09.731 position:33% line:83% align:start
in accordance
with that rising number,

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:13.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
the same amount of living
creatures are in decline.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
It would appear that
the number of souls

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:18.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
that exist in full
is a fixed constant.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
But let me posit a theory,

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:23.143 position:10% line:83% align:start
what if one person were able
to possess several more,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
or perhaps even thousands
more souls simultaneously?

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
What do you think such
a person has the power to see?

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.887 position:30% line:83% align:start
What will that
person's future hold?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
And how soon will it
come to pass?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.694 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, I have absolutely
no idea.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:42.429 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, it's definitely
a fascinating concept

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.898 position:19% line:89% align:start
to imagine coming true.

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:48.235 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, then, uh, what is it
you want me to do, exactly?

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:50.437 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, Sports Maximum.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
My request to you has to do
with this specific bone I own.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.710 position:10% line:89% align:start
I want you to use your power

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
to attempt to modify
the state of this.

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.683 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think you can take
this bone and resurrect it?

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:04.619 position:33% line:83% align:start
Whose is it?
Is it from a human body?

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:05.987 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or something else?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.188 position:13% line:89% align:start
That is irrelevant to you.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.991 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's just say
I took possession Nof it

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.191 position:24% line:89% align:start
from an old friend.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:12.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sports Maximum]
But it's just one single piece

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.428 position:10% line:89% align:start
of a far more complex whole.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.296 position:16% line:89% align:start
How can I resurrect that?

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
Or do you have a stockpile

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
of all his other assorted
bones somewhere?

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.504 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is it possible to resurrect
something from just one bone?

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:25.606 position:44% line:89% align:start
Dio.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.208 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the one bone of his
that remains.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
The rest became dust
and scattered

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:32.780 position:19% line:83% align:start
like ashes on the wind,
no longer of this world.

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:35.717 position:16% line:83% align:start
You must do this for me,
Sports Maximum.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.087 position:7% line:83% align:start
But if you're incapable of it,
well then,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be forced to take back
in full

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:42.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
the power I gave you before.

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:44.826 position:35% line:83% align:start
Believe me!
I understand that.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.729 position:27% line:83% align:start
But don't worry,
because I've already done it.

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:48.596 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.598 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right!
I've already finished.

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:51.566 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're welcome!

What the hell is this?

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.145 position:30% line:83% align:start

Where did it go?

What did you do
with the bone, fool?

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm asking you where
his bone went.

00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:13.286 position:21% line:89% align:start
You'd best answer me!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.690 position:38% line:83% align:start
[choking]
I swear I don't know.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.993 position:41% line:83% align:start
I mean
are we sure it's really Dio's?

I can't control it
with my power.

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:31.438 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just not strong enough.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's bizarre to imagine
it would

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.942 position:7% line:89% align:start
move around on its own, but...

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:36.343 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes, it's here somewhere.
I can sense it.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.650 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can actually feel it moving
within the walls of this room.

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.620 position:38% line:83% align:start
Find it!
Start looking right now!

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:50.224 position:27% line:83% align:start
Agh! No, not yet!
Wait a minute, Sports Maximum.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.358 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.927 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Pale Snake]This can only mean

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.061 position:13% line:89% align:start
that I was right all along.

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
That the way to heaven
he kept tantalizing me with

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:59.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
does in fact exists,
and this proves it.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:03.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
The search will continue,
but let's suspend it for now.

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:07.440 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's quite obvious. We must
let it decide its own course.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.243 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll observe it first,
then combine it

00:05:09.277 --> 00:05:11.311 position:10% line:89% align:start
with Jotaro Cujoh's memories.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
For everyone to find out
the real truth

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.616 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all!

[Sport Maximum]
I can feel the bone's presence

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:19.287 position:19% line:83% align:start
at the Maximum Security
Disciplinary Wing,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
right as we speak.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.424 position:19% line:83% align:start

have picked it up, though.

-that Ermes found by chance.
-[pants]

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.937 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
Jolyne's seen this, too.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.505 position:7% line:83% align:start
What? Did Jolyne make it so she
can go to the Discipline Cell

00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:40.775 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did Jolyne make it so she
can go to the Discipline Cell

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:43.744 position:27% line:83% align:start
just to find that
same bone belonging to Dio?

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.980 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
but it's way too reckless.

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:49.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pale Snake is definitely
gonna do his best

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.785 position:10% line:89% align:start
to take out Jolyne for good.

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:51.719 position:24% line:89% align:start
Especially now that

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:54.655 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sports Maximum's memories
were discovered.

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
If Jolyne stays there
by herself, she's done for.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:06:02.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only reason I'm alive
right now is Jolyne, that's it!

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now, I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.735 position:24% line:83% align:start
Isn't there any way
you can help me?

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:09.303 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

to go over there, either.

of the men's wing.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.788 position:33% line:83% align:start
To get there,
you have to get on

the prisoner
transport vehicle,

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:31.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
so there's no shortcut

00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:01.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
Why not?
He's a Stand User, isn't he?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll do anything

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
just aren't parts of
his personality.

00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:35.790 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I mean, um...

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:40.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, so you haven't heard
of the name Anastasia?

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:43.164 position:7% line:83% align:start
-He's a cold-blooded murderer.
-[gasps]

00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:48.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, his full name
is Narciso Anastasia.

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:50.104 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't know what
might have triggered it,

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:54.608 position:16% line:83% align:start
but since he was a child,
he's had one bizarre habit.

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:58.179 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, it's not so much a habit,
as it is a syndrome.

00:07:59.013 --> 00:08:00.348 position:19% line:89% align:start
One that compels him to

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.216 position:30% line:83% align:start
take everything
he touches apart.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:05.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's seemingly no limit to
what he'll dismantle either.

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:08.889 position:7% line:83% align:start
When he was ten, he took apart
his neighbor's Porsche,

00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:11.826 position:13% line:83% align:start
and he was in the hospital
for six months.

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:15.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's even taken apart
a high-voltage telephone pole.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.965 position:33% line:83% align:start
And one time,
when he was 21,

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:20.034 position:27% line:83% align:start
he went to visit
his then-girlfriend,

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:21.235 position:19% line:89% align:start
showing up unannounced

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
late that night
at her apartment.

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:25.940 position:16% line:89% align:start
When he opened the door,

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:28.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
he found her in bed
with another man.

00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:33.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
He wanted to ensure
they'd never be together again,

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:34.915 position:21% line:89% align:start
so he separated them

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:37.051 position:35% line:83% align:start
into dozens
of irreparable pieces.

00:08:37.485 --> 00:08:38.586 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:39.954 position:30% line:89% align:start
He was arrested

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.156 position:27% line:83% align:start
and went through
a psychiatric evaluation.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
The results were normal.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:46.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
And that's why he ended up
here at the Aquarium.

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:49.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no telling what
he would do

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
if Weather Forecast wasn't
holding him down

00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:52.299 position:24% line:89% align:start
for safety's sake.

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:54.301 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's who he really is.

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.505 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, please forget it!

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:59.407 position:33% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Shit!
But I have to get to Jolyne.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.609 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'll never make it
by myself.

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:03.577 position:19% line:89% align:start
I need reinforcements.

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:06.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, if I can ask
for a perfect backup,

00:09:06.247 --> 00:09:07.081 position:33% line:89% align:start
it'll be him.

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:08.983 position:27% line:89% align:start
But it's bizarre.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:10.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
This feeling...

00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.354 position:10% line:89% align:start
If asking nicely won't work,

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll let my F.F. bullets
do the talking.

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:16.857 position:13% line:89% align:start
They're pretty persuasive.

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.160 position:41% line:83% align:start
Dammit!
That's his Stand, though.

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:22.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's a pretty good chance
my first shot will go way wide.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.332 position:16% line:83% align:start
Where am I even supposed
to aim?

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:27.435 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to go in,
like it's the kill shot.

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.538 position:16% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, he won't even
acknowledge me,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.072 position:24% line:89% align:start
much less obey me.

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:34.408 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's unnerving,
but I have to do it.

00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:36.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the whole reason
why I came here.

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.347 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, I'll help you.

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-If you really want,

00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:44.085 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll protect Jolyne Cujoh.

00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:47.788 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Emporio] Huh?
-I will, as you say, cooperate.

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:52.626 position:13% line:83% align:start
Also, if she's looking for
that bone or whatever it is,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
that seems to be
in such demand,

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:56.630 position:7% line:89% align:start
then, I'll help find that, too.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:59.066 position:30% line:89% align:start
We have to go.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.203 position:10% line:83% align:start
She might be getting attacked
even as we speak right now.

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:07.208 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Agh, wait! Anastasia!

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.845 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you scheming to do?

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.080 position:33% line:89% align:start
Me? Scheming?

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.117 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, it's just as I said.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll protect her
with every power I have.

00:10:19.086 --> 00:10:20.187 position:30% line:89% align:start
But, but you...

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:23.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] Honestly,
I've come to like her,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
everything about her
from my first view.

00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:28.629 position:33% line:83% align:start
For example,
I respect her resolve to

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:31.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
go to the Discipline Cell
for her father.

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:34.569 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's quite admirable
to say the very least.

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:37.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I keep her safe
through this,

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.541 position:16% line:83% align:start
then I plan on making her
my bride.

00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:40.841 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's the condition.

00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:42.810 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:45.146 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're F.F., right?

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:47.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
You said you'll do anything,
didn't you?

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:50.985 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right then,
give us your blessing.

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:54.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
No marriage is official
without one.

00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:58.826 position:10% line:83% align:start
Huh? Did, uh, did he just say
what I think he said?

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:02.196 position:19% line:83% align:start
Am I going insane here?
He wants to marry Jolyne?

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.667 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.570 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] Diver Drive!

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:10.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:15.142 position:38% line:89% align:start
[zapping]

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:23.784 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.386 position:7% line:89% align:start
[guard] What the hell was that?

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:28.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we find you set off
a bomb in there, you're dead.

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:30.257 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:11:36.397 --> 00:11:40.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
So... so it's in the wall
with the time delay.

00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.505 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's Anastasia's Stand.

00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:45.472 position:27% line:83% align:start
He has the power
of Diver Drive.

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.844 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
Give us your blessings.

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:02.022 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi] Hey,
just out of curiosity, Dio.

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:04.458 position:24% line:83% align:start
Out of all the ones
you've ever come across,

00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:07.662 position:38% line:83% align:start
what was
the weakest Stand power?

00:12:07.696 --> 00:12:09.096 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'd love to know.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter
whether it's one

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:14.034 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you happened to find
anywhere in the world,

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:16.337 position:35% line:83% align:start
or one that
you newly manifested.

00:12:18.673 --> 00:12:20.174 position:16% line:89% align:start
For any pursuit in life,

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.909 position:24% line:83% align:start
people should find
an occupation

00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:24.646 position:30% line:83% align:start
that best fits
their true personality.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.715 position:7% line:89% align:start
A king would feel like a king,

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:29.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
and a chef would feel
like a chef, you see.

00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:31.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what it means
to live truly.

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:34.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
The same goes for Stands.

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:37.191 position:21% line:83% align:start
Strength and weakness
do not apply.

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:38.859 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi]
I phrased that badly.

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:40.894 position:21% line:89% align:start
I meant it more like

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
when little kids debate
about who'd win in a fight,

00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:45.165 position:13% line:89% align:start
says Stallone or Van Damme.

00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:48.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Dio] In that case,

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Stand I named Survivor
is the weakest.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.340 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's beyond control.

00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:57.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Survivor? The name
sounds strong, though!

00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:59.714 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Dio] It was the year 1982.

00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:01.616 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the Lorraine region
of France,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
a group of six hikers
met with disaster.

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:06.854 position:30% line:83% align:start
All six of them
perished totally.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
After the recon team
examined the area

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.892 position:13% line:89% align:start
where the tragedy occurred,

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
they found evidence
of brutal combat.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.798 position:24% line:83% align:start
They had all fought
literally to the death.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.969 position:27% line:83% align:start
They had attacked
one another with so much force,

00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:25.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
their bones shattered
instantly upon contact.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tooth that had broken off
after being struck

00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:30.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
was found half-buried
in the nearby rock.

00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:33.047 position:13% line:89% align:start
The damage was so horrific.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even the so-called winner
was hurt too badly

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:38.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
to descend and died
of his wounds as well.

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:42.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
As I found out later,

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
those people had stayed
at a mountain hut

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.359 position:27% line:89% align:start
the night before.

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.228 position:19% line:83% align:start
And had an altercation
with the owner of it.

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:51.332 position:19% line:83% align:start
One of the women there
cruelly insulted the man.

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:54.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
In fact, she told him
his body odor was vile.

00:13:54.068 --> 00:13:57.271 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is it safe to assume the owner
of the hut was a Stand User?

00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:00.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Dio] That's right!
But what did the owner do?

00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:02.009 position:13% line:83% align:start
What was it that compelled
those people

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:03.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
to fight each other
to the death?

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.314 position:10% line:89% align:start
The answer is nothing at all.

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.084 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nothing externally, at least.

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:12.219 position:16% line:83% align:start
But deep in the recesses
of his brain,

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
anger was slowly beginning
to brew.

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:17.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before much longer,
that anger evolved enough

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.960 position:38% line:83% align:start
to become
a weak electric signal.

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.195 position:16% line:89% align:start
The signal then descended

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.030 position:24% line:83% align:start
through his entire
nervous system

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:25.232 position:13% line:89% align:start
and flowed into the ground.

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.302 position:27% line:89% align:start
That is Survivor.

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
The electric signal
traveled along

00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:31.806 position:13% line:89% align:start
the surface of the ground,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
directly toward the six people.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.309 position:16% line:89% align:start
For the ground and shoes

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:39.547 position:7% line:83% align:start
to better conduct electricity,
the ground needs to be wet.

00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:43.150 position:10% line:83% align:start
The electrical power a nerve
carries at any given time,

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.919 position:30% line:83% align:start
measures a mere
seven-hundredths of a Volt.

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:49.123 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how little power
that Stand has.

00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:52.326 position:13% line:83% align:start
Survivor's attacks make one
feel nothing,

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:54.061 position:21% line:89% align:start
and it does nothing.

00:14:54.094 --> 00:14:56.096 position:35% line:83% align:start
Its effects
don't come close to things

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
like severely injuring
or controlling people.

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:01.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nor weakening them,
or even knocking them out.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.806 position:24% line:83% align:start
It doesn't inflict
one external action.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:08.175 position:7% line:83% align:start
-All it does is make them mad.
-[zapping]

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.077 position:10% line:89% align:start
It awakens combative instinct

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.413 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the limbic system
of people's brains.

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just a little at first,
and then it proliferates.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because one woman
said he smelled bad,

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:21.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
he drove the entire group
into a bloody brawl.

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.057 position:13% line:89% align:start
One that ended in carnage.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.028 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi]
Earlier, you said it

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.997 position:35% line:83% align:start
was beyond
anyone's control, right?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes, it's an unusable Stand.

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:35.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
It can't distinguish
between enemies and allies.

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:38.105 position:21% line:83% align:start
If there's infighting
among your subordinates,

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:40.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
your organization falls apart.

00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:45.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi] So, then,
may I have that?

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:48.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you don't need it,
just the Stand.

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.050 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Dio] Are you going to remove
the power

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:52.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
and keep it as a disc?
Because if so...

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:54.955 position:16% line:89% align:start
that just might work out.

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.356 position:19% line:89% align:start
The exact right person

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
at the exact right place
and moment,

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.995 position:16% line:89% align:start
that time might be nigh.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, these mushrooms
might be okay to eat.

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:09.403 position:21% line:89% align:start
Guess I'll try some.

00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:12.439 position:24% line:89% align:start

around with my thread,

anyway?

I don't even know yet.

Either way,

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.729 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know it's somewhere in
this Discipline Cell Building.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.398 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.689 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every single muscle is
a gorgeous work of art.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.757 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful!

00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:54.227 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I can tap right into
where all his strengths are.

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:57.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
I see the raw beauty
of battle, and I love it.

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Okay, this just got
even weirder.

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:00.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
And what's with their backs?

00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:04.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those things that look like
flashlights or something.

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:07.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Westwood] Let's go!
Just FYI, you have no chance.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.210 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna reduce you
to a stain on the floor.

Yeah! I am a Golden God!

[yells]

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Wait!

00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is this actually
a Stand attack?

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.605 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is that guard the enemy?

00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:41.075 position:33% line:83% align:start
No! The enemy
hasn't revealed itself yet.

00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:44.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
But, this is a Stand.
I know it is.

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:47.380 position:27% line:83% align:start
This abnormality
is a Stand attack.

under their feet,

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:56.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
and turn and tear you
in pieces."

Matthew 7:6.

00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:03.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
Regrettably, Sports Maximum
is missing.

00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:05.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't know how or why
they were able to find out.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.603 position:7% line:83% align:start
But there's no doubt they read
through Maximum's memories

00:21:08.636 --> 00:21:11.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
and this is a rather
large problem.

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:14.108 position:27% line:83% align:start
To fix this, I've
sent four Stand Users

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the Discipline
Cell Building.

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:16.911 position:38% line:89% align:start
However,

00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:22.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
If Jolyne Cujoh has
found her way

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:24.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the Discipline Cell,
in pursuit

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.385 position:16% line:89% align:start
of Dio's priceless bone.

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:27.320 position:30% line:89% align:start
[bell wailing]

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:32.059 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can not allow her
to live anymore.

00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:33.261 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's no choice.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I will make sure
it's done right.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't care how it happens
as long as

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.600 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's in the Discipline
Cell Building.

00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:42.537 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those four people will do
anything and everything

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.174 position:7% line:83% align:start
to ensure the total eradication
of Jotaro's daughter.

00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:48.042 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everything is riding on it.

00:21:49.043 --> 00:21:51.012 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hang on!
Is he letting them out?

[suspenseful music playing]

[Westwood] I can see
your points of power.

00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:01.856 position:30% line:89% align:start
And all of you!

[prisoners cheer]

00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:06.426 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can see where
your strengths lie from here.

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.830 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your most dominant
muscle groups

00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:11.032 position:21% line:89% align:start
and they're glorious.

00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:13.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welcome to Fight Club!

00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:15.837 position:21% line:89% align:start
