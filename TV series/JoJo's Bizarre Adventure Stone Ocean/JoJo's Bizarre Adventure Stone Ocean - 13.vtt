This is the second time
you've caused us a problem.

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.851 position:30% line:83% align:start
The first time
was a failed escape attempt.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:53.320 position:10% line:83% align:start
And this time, there's a dead
female prisoner in the crypt,

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
with a bleeding crater in
her skull.

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd call that unnatural.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.326 position:27% line:83% align:start
And yet, somehow
you have the balls

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
to remain silent
and throw us attitude.

Deadly accidents,

We can't prove
you're behind them,

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:12.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you can't escape that
criminal reputation of yours.

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.046 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, from now on,

[Jolyne] The one thing
I can't let happen

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.058 position:30% line:83% align:start
is the loss of
mental strength.

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.292 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to stay strong
and focused.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.895 position:13% line:89% align:start
Stress kills your stamina.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.230 position:24% line:89% align:start

that I have
to achieve here at this Unit.

I'll get it done,
no matter what.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:54.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] But the only way
it's gonna happen is if

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:58.178 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't let myself surrender
to useless exhaustion.

No.

[Dio] If someone wished
to go to heaven,

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:15.362 position:24% line:89% align:start
there may be a way.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:15.963 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:19.199 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Dio] Hey, don't look at me
that way.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.602 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not like I'm telling you
to wither and die.

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:24.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
This heaven pertains
to our spirits,

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.908 position:7% line:89% align:start
and where they go after death.

00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:30.377 position:19% line:83% align:start
As your spirit evolves,
so too does your power.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.047 position:10% line:83% align:start
Where they ultimately end up
is what fascinates me.

00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:35.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean that place
where they go.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.985 position:13% line:89% align:start
Surely, you, of all people,

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
understand what
I'm talking about.

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:43.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
Within that place lies
real true happiness.

00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you can actually
reach heaven, that is.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.595 position:27% line:89% align:start
Though, I'm aware

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:50.430 position:24% line:83% align:start
joy cannot be found
by having an invincible body,

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:54.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
vast riches, or even reigning
over all humanity.

00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:57.404 position:13% line:89% align:start
In the end, the true winner

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.640 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the one who gets
to witness heaven.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.745 position:10% line:89% align:start
Offering whatever sacrifice.

I'll put a sticker on this.

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:57.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
It splits in two.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:02.063 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is my particular power.

It's called Smack.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.301 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I peel the sticker off,
the pen will revert

back to
its original single form.

00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I can destroy it
by cracking it.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.444 position:19% line:83% align:start

Instead of my right hand,

The opposite of pork
is salmon.

Pigs are lazy bastards,

[Jolyne] Gloria Costello.

[Ermes] For the past few days,

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been watching
your every move

00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:38.772 position:19% line:89% align:start
closely and carefully,

00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:41.108 position:13% line:89% align:start
just biding my sweet time.

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.612 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then, in a surprising
turn of events,

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.146 position:16% line:89% align:start
I saw you hanging around

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:47.381 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the former prison's
cemetery, cleaning.

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.150 position:10% line:89% align:start
You left some flowers there.

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:52.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it the grave of
some fellow gang members

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:54.054 position:10% line:89% align:start
that died by electric chair?

00:10:55.256 --> 00:10:57.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
I also saw you skulking
around in the workshop,

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:01.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
making stuffed birds
and alligators, of all things.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:04.465 position:7% line:83% align:start
How'd a thug like you suddenly
take an interest

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
in crafts like taxidermy?

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.770 position:41% line:83% align:start
I mean,
it doesn't really matter.

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.540 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only thing
I actually give a shit about

00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.407 position:7% line:89% align:start
and want to know for sure is...

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.645 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:18.547 position:27% line:89% align:start
Jolyne, and F.F.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.081 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Ermes,
you're looking well.

00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:23.884 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, here!
I brought you some breakfast.

[grunts]

00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:27.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
By the way,

00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:30.024 position:21% line:83% align:start
that guy you've been
following around for days...

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:32.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who I'm following?
What do you mean?

00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:34.862 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cut the crap!

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:36.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] His name is
Sports Maximum.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.266 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sure! Outside,
he's a Big-D gangster.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
But right now, he's doing

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:41.769 position:30% line:83% align:start
a hard time in
the men's ward here.

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:45.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
How fascinating,
but I don't give a rat's ass.

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:46.541 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, Ermes!

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:47.642 position:21% line:89% align:start
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:47.676 --> 00:11:48.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
the reason you were sent
to Green Dolphin

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:50.978 position:30% line:83% align:start
was for robbing
a convenience store, right?

00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:55.716 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you go out of your way
to cause an incident

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:56.951 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you purposely
get arrested?

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
You wanted to get revenge
on him,

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:01.956 position:13% line:83% align:start
as payback for your sister
I know it.

00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.057 position:38% line:89% align:start
Back off!

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.527 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's against the rules here
to investigate people.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.794 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that right?

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:10.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but today I chose
to do the opposite thing.

It's none of your business.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:16.070 position:21% line:89% align:start
Go back to your ward.

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:21.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just as Ermes
said earlier, Jolyne.

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:24.178 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've got your own important
objective here. Am I right?

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:25.779 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] I guess...

00:12:27.716 --> 00:12:29.850 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Wait for me, Gloria.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:33.387 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll get revenge on him
with my own hands.

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:39.694 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ermes, dear.

00:12:39.728 --> 00:12:42.196 position:21% line:83% align:start
From now on, I'll be
your foster mother.

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.063 position:27% line:89% align:start

before anything else.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:58.946 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gloria] Ermes,
we could really use

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:01.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
your help around
