Yeah, but if we're going

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:47.360 position:7% line:83% align:start
in the same place on the back

that shares the same shape.

Since you have no memory,

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.843 position:16% line:83% align:start
does that mean it's safe
to assume that the priest

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:04.411 position:13% line:83% align:start
extracted your memory disc
like all the others?

00:07:57.545 --> 00:07:58.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you think there's a force

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:01.082 position:7% line:83% align:start
that draws certain individuals
together?

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:03.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
Personally, this moment
has made me a believer.

00:08:03.818 --> 00:08:06.454 position:21% line:83% align:start
You are not capable
of killing me.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.555 position:21% line:89% align:start
You are here because

00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:10.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
my gravitational pull
led you to me.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:11.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you see that
you shouldn't be

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.428 position:21% line:83% align:start
wasting your energy
on useless drugs?

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:16.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, you should be
using your energy

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.565 position:16% line:89% align:start
on something much wiser.

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.934 position:35% line:83% align:start
[whimpers]
Fuck this!

00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:28.576 position:13% line:89% align:start
From the looks of things,

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:31.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
where it pertains
to who your father really is

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:33.781 position:27% line:83% align:start
the three of you
are left in the dark.

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that won't last
much longer.

[dramatic music]

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:47.028 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now that we've
been brought together,

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.663 position:7% line:83% align:start
you will understand everything
soon enough.

Oh, thank you very much.

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:20.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm fine.

00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:21.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry to bother you.

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is nothing.

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:25.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just an old knee injury
from my carpentry days.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:28.736 position:30% line:83% align:start
When it rains,
my joints start to twinge.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.005 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Weather]
When it rains your knee hurts.

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.139 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sure does.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thanks for showing me
some kindness.

Stop getting into

Weather.

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.551 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're still fugitives,
remember?

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our faces are blasted
all over the news.

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:46.821 position:10% line:89% align:start
The geezer might report us.

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:48.557 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our best bet is to steal a car

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:50.891 position:7% line:83% align:start
and get the hell out of Dodge
immediately.

00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:52.126 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Weather]
No stolen cars.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
It'll be too easy
for them to track us.

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:56.597 position:5% line:89% align:start
And then we'll never lose them.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
Chasing the priest
would become impossible.

00:09:58.766 --> 00:10:01.769 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're not suggesting
we take the bus, are you?

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:04.573 position:10% line:83% align:start
How long are we supposed to
wait till the next one comes?

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.509 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[old man] Oh, hey fellas.
-[both gasp]

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:09.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
[old man] You thinking
of taking the bus?

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
It won't be here
for another hour.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:14.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
How about I give you boys
a ride on my truck?

00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:16.283 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll have to hop in
the back though.

00:10:16.317 --> 00:10:19.386 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's because you were
so kind to me earlier,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.622 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I'm feeling
better than ever.

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:24.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
The pain in my knees
was awful moments ago,

00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:26.427 position:10% line:89% align:start
but it's miraculously gone.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.796 position:30% line:83% align:start
The sky feels
so refreshing, too.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:29.463 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh.

Call it luck. We should
take his offer, Anastasia.

[distant sirens blaring]

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.632 position:27% line:83% align:start
So how's Jolyne
getting around right now?

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:06.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
She is still safe, isn't she?

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:09.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jolyne is currently
heading north.

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:11.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of that I'm certain.

00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:14.341 position:21% line:83% align:start
At any rate, we need
to be heading north as well.

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.480 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
There's a famous theme park

00:11:19.514 --> 00:11:20.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
in the city up north.

00:11:20.848 --> 00:11:22.349 position:21% line:89% align:start
You ever been there?

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:24.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, you wouldn't remember.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
At this theme park,

00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:28.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
the mascot's
a really famous character.

00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:30.858 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you might even
know him... [gasps]

is a total piece of crap.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:42.169 position:16% line:83% align:start
It doesn't even show any
of the famous characters in it!

Hey! Something's
running around back here!

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:56.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
Could it be an enemy?

You sure? I still
see something darting around.

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.963 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well.
I got this one for sure.

There's zero chance
this old man's the Stand User.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.122 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no reason
to show up the way he did.

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.191 position:7% line:83% align:start
He could have just attacked us
from anywhere.

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:39.994 position:10% line:83% align:start
If it's not him, it must be
someone else in the area.

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:42.363 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just like you're able to sense
where Jolyne is going,

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
maybe the priest
can sense us getting closer

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:47.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
and is sending his lackeys
to stop us from getting to him.

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:49.370 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, who the hell are you?

Ah, honestly, my nose just
grows on its own sometimes.

00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:29.076 position:35% line:83% align:start
You know,
it's sort of like a reflex.

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:32.079 position:10% line:83% align:start
See, whenever I tell a lie,
my nose gets all long and junk.

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:34.248 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I just lied
straight to your face.

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:37.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
But what I told you
wasn't exactly a complete lie.

00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:40.321 position:13% line:83% align:start
So basically, I might not
be working with somebody,

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:43.157 position:19% line:83% align:start

Didn't I say to stop
being so violent?

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.305 position:21% line:83% align:start
It feels kinda weird
saying this about myself,

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:00.775 position:33% line:83% align:start
but I think
I'm a pretty good guy.

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm definitely nice
to children, at least.

I might have been your friend

Just so you know,
that apple isn't poisonous.

00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's okay to eat.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:37.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but the one
Snow White ate was poisonous.

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:40.381 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, she didn't actually eat it,
she choked on a piece of it.

00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.517 position:30% line:83% align:start
So technically
she didn't digest it.

00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:45.152 position:33% line:83% align:start
But, I mean,
who would eat an apple

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:47.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
from an old lady
they didn't know?

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even on Valentine's day,
we're careful about

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.924 position:30% line:83% align:start
the chocolates
we put in our mouths.

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.326 position:30% line:83% align:start
Although it's
that carelessness of hers

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:54.796 position:7% line:83% align:start
that makes you want to protect
her with your whole life.

You know,
who's your favorite character?

00:15:09.544 --> 00:15:11.345 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe it was little ol' me?

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:14.348 position:10% line:83% align:start

for The Terminator T-1000,

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.850 position:30% line:83% align:start

And The Elephant Man, too.

00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:22.022 position:21% line:83% align:start
But no matter what,
our Princess Snow White

00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:24.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
is the best character ever!

[all dwarves] Heigh-ho!

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
We know all the rumors
about us,

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:29.329 position:21% line:83% align:start
like how we like to
sneak into a girl's panties

00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.866 position:10% line:83% align:start
and do dirty things to her,
but they're lies!

Our relationship is platonic
all the way!

They're so familiar.

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:47.114 position:33% line:83% align:start

Today at 1:30 p.m.,

Batman suddenly disappeared
from all over the world.

-I repeat,N-Huh...

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.259 position:10% line:89% align:start
the beloved Batman is gone.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:01.228 position:10% line:83% align:start
Paintings and prints of him
have also faded

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
and we're currently
investigating

00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:04.264 position:7% line:89% align:start
the cause of this phenomenon.

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:06.568 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've received several reports
of other famous characters

You hear that, Weather?

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:12.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are these little freaks
who I think they are?

00:16:12.607 --> 00:16:14.642 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does this mean
they've been brought to life?

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:16.644 position:10% line:89% align:start

I'd say it has something

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:34.616 position:16% line:83% align:start
to do with my ignorance

The characters from
stories and comics

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.113 position:13% line:89% align:start
are brought into reality.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
And in addition to that,
this Stand has the ability

00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:10.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
to separate someone's soul
from their body.

Your soul split from your body

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:36.376 position:21% line:83% align:start

a sec. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:56.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:59.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
Children all across this small
world of ours are on my side!

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:03.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
You bastard! This is not
how the story's supposed to go!

00:20:03.137 --> 00:20:04.839 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Pinocchio screams]

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.444 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where'd Weather go?

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:15.382 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't afford to be separated
from him and my body.

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:17.284 position:24% line:83% align:start
[old man groaning]
Wait!

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:19.620 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please just wait!

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:21.689 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, old man,

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:23.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're the one who caused
the accident in the first place

00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.358 position:24% line:89% align:start
so we're leaving.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:29.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, hold on. Please, wait.
I can't hear you very well.

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:31.431 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:33.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
As you see,
I have quite a lot of hair

00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:35.870 position:7% line:89% align:start
growing on my ears these days.

00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:37.605 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come closer, would you?

00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:40.208 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't have time for this.
Just sit tight and wait.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.643 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure someone will show up
soon and call you an ambulance.

00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:46.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
Did you hurt your fingers too?
Your nails are cracked.

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:49.817 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's not it.
I just have large hands.

00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:52.787 position:7% line:83% align:start
All the better for hugging you
with, as thanks for helping me.

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:55.455 position:33% line:83% align:start
By the way,
your pants are ripped

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.158 position:27% line:83% align:start
and something's
coming out of there.

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, this is just
a feather duster.

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:01.328 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your pants must have gotten
pretty dirty

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.496 position:16% line:89% align:start
when you saved my life.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
How about you let me
dust them off for ya?

00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:06.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you all right?

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.969 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your mouth is getting
freakishly big.

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:11.038 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's right! All the better
to devour you with,

00:21:11.072 --> 00:21:12.240 position:16% line:89% align:start
Little Red Riding Hood!

This ending
is just like the story.

00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:30.423 position:38% line:83% align:start
A what?
Did he just say "story"?

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:35.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
Weather!

00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:37.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music]

00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:39.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Weather] I have a feeling
that Pinocchio, the dwarves

00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:42.970 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the other characters
aren't the actual Stands.

00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:45.540 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Stand User and their
ability exist elsewhere

00:21:45.573 --> 00:21:48.676 position:7% line:83% align:start
as separate entities and they
brought these beings to life.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:52.345 position:24% line:83% align:start
Towards the north.
Somewhere not too far away.

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:53.714 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's the direction I sense

00:21:53.748 --> 00:21:56.150 position:21% line:83% align:start
the enemy's ability
coming from.

00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:58.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
Pinocchio was just
the beginning.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Stand User
must be taken down.

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:02.455 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] Weather!

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
