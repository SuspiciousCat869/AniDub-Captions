I must know.

Oh, well, I wrote down
the process in a notebook.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the next 20 years,
I was forced to wait

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:30.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
to finally obtain
Jotaro's memory.

of the notebook in his disc.

if I can get his Stand back.

was I trying to go?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.609 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, right, I remember now.

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:56.978 position:21% line:89% align:start
It was to the chapel.

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:59.146 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm going to the chapel.

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
And my objective
once I'm there

00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:05.453 position:30% line:83% align:start
is to find and
take that bone.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.722 position:38% line:83% align:start
Make sure
you understand this clearly.

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.489 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you fail me,

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:11.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be taking back
the ability I gave you

00:08:11.392 --> 00:08:13.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I won't be gentle
about it.

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:14.695 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's good!

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
My power, Limp Viscuit, can
get the job done and it will.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.969 position:10% line:83% align:start
When I possess the bone that
Pale Snake ordered me to find,

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.171 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be able to...

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! Damn it!

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:29.877 position:10% line:83% align:start
I really need to take a rest
before I do anything else.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to wash this grime off
my body

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:33.647 position:19% line:83% align:start
and pour something down
my throat.

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
A fresh cleansing
and refreshing beverage.

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:38.185 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
That woman over there...
[exhales]

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.324 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good timing!

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.994 position:27% line:83% align:start
The skanky, um...
What was her name again?

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:48.963 position:33% line:89% align:start
I forgot it.

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:51.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
Bitch will do fine.

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.669 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scoffs]

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:58.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
The bribe's in my hand,
he won't even acknowledge me.

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, how are you
doing tonight?

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.245 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you on duty,
so to speak?

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
I need to go get
a drink right now.

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:08.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
Feel like coming
to the cafÃ© with me?

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.718 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then we can find
a nice, dark corner somewhere

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:13.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
and have ourselves a little
old-fashioned fun.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.288 position:24% line:89% align:start
How about it, huh?

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:15.524 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you say to wiping

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:16.757 position:13% line:83% align:start
-each other's bodies down?
-Huh?

Hey, asshole!

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't put your fucking hand
on me unless I say so.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
You want to handle
the merchandise,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
show me the money first.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.037 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wasn't trying
to do anything, lady!

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:31.439 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did this slimy
little bottom really

00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:34.775 position:13% line:83% align:start
just attempted to touch you
and not even offered a pay?

-[screams]

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:40.214 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:41.982 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Shit!

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:45.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
Where did Sports Maximum go?
We gotta find him.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Maybe when that
zombie-ass alligator

00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:48.622 position:19% line:89% align:start
was trying to kill us,

00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:50.357 position:27% line:83% align:start
he wormed his way
out of the pipe.

00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:51.892 position:35% line:89% align:start
Or maybe...

00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:53.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] He somehow
transformed into

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:55.796 position:10% line:89% align:start
an invisible corpse himself.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.099 position:10% line:83% align:start
[prisoner] I just kicked you
a little bit.

00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:00.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't be an idiot
and you won't get hurt.

00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:02.103 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, be an idiot?

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:04.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
You have to earn their respect
or it's all over.

00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:07.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must make them pay
or there's no point.

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.810 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why don't you
help me look, too?

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:11.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
Did you hear me?

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.180 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on! Find his money.

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.648 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:10:14.682 --> 00:10:16.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a telling bulge
in his sleeve.

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:17.985 position:33% line:89% align:start
[woman] Huh?

00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:19.920 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're kidding me!

00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.655 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you had the cash
the whole time?

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:23.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you say so
before, jerk?

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sports Maximum]
I literally just told you that.

00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:27.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
You really are slow,
aren't you?

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:30.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder if he's hiding
anything else

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.299 position:19% line:89% align:start
somewhere in this husk.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe I can find it in here.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:37.738 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:40.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
So you want me to... really?
Right here with you?

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I don't even want
to try to figure this out.

00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:45.813 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, no way!
I have seen enough.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.281 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is so not happening.

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:50.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have done some weird shit,
but this is way off the charts.

Hah?

00:10:55.557 --> 00:10:57.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope you don't mind,
I'll be taking this.

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
What an excellent find,
thank you!

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.768 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:10.905 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait! What the hell is this?

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:12.006 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's for sure not drug.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.609 position:27% line:83% align:start

under my skin.

Ugh, it reeks just like...

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:18.412 position:44% line:89% align:start
shit!

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.281 position:27% line:89% align:start

Oh, no! It's everywhere!

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.619 position:27% line:89% align:start

I was so desperate for a drink.

00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:55.015 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was truly starving.

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:57.451 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only way I could quench
this thirst

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:58.919 position:21% line:89% align:start
was by eating brains.

Shit! Even with a broken arm!

Right, I forgot.
He's just a rotten corpse now.

That isn't Sports Maximum
under there.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.442 position:10% line:83% align:start
He was moving the dead girl's
corpse as a decoy

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:02.843 position:24% line:89% align:start
and you bought it.

Ugh, are you okay?

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:31.038 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jolyne,
stop moving and stay put.

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.742 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is not your battle
to fight, you know.

00:14:33.775 --> 00:14:36.443 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sports Maximum
is my problem, not yours.

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:38.312 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ermes, I told you before.

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:39.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
We've leveled up.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
This goes way beyond
just revenge

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:44.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
or what you consider
your own personal problem.

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:44.652 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:47.921 position:10% line:89% align:start
And it's not even just that.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.658 position:16% line:83% align:start
We don't have the time or
the room to even think.

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.025 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you understand that?

00:14:52.426 --> 00:14:53.160 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, look!

00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:59.333 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Ugh, no, it can't be.
-Oh, yes, it can.

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.268 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne]
We didn't catch it, then.

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
But he already backed us
into a corner a long time ago.

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.374 position:33% line:83% align:start
Every one of
the invisible corpses

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:10.310 position:7% line:83% align:start
-had already been resurrected!
-[Ermes grunts]

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:13.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have no idea how many
or where they are.

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:15.082 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We're surrounded, Ermes.
-[zombies moan]

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.552 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to find the way
out of here, now!

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:19.319 position:21% line:89% align:start
Survival comes first!

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:20.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we don't open the door
and escape,

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
these will be our last words.

00:15:22.724 --> 00:15:25.959 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll stretch my thread to
full extension and call F.F.

00:15:25.993 --> 00:15:27.394 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] For now, we back off.

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:30.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
You can collect the disc and
get your sweet revenge later.

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:31.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
I promise!

00:15:34.435 --> 00:15:36.571 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Ermes!

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:38.807 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right! Revenge!

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.976 position:35% line:83% align:start
And that's
the important part, Jolyne!

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.945 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I know what has to
be equally important

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:46.246 position:24% line:89% align:start
to Sports Maximum,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.348 position:33% line:83% align:start
who's hiding
somewhere around here.

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.050 position:24% line:89% align:start
He wants vengeance

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:52.152 position:33% line:83% align:start
for my having
drowned him in the pipe.

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:53.353 position:13% line:89% align:start
His mind must have flooded

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:55.022 position:27% line:83% align:start
with thoughts of
how to retaliate.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
He wants to chew my head
to pulp,

00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:00.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
and drain the blood
spewing from it

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.563 position:16% line:89% align:start
until he's sure I'm dead.

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:02.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
What are you--?

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:03.798 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] The one who'll
eventually end me

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
is definitely
that bastard himself,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
with his own foul teeth.

00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.036 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't say that!

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:10.404 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Listen to me, Jolyne.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.072 position:19% line:83% align:start
There're tons of people
who'd say,

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:14.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Getting revenge won't bring
your sister back!"

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:17.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
as if they understand
what I'm trying to do.

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:20.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
And others who would tell me
forgiveness is important.

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:24.786 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] I don't care!

00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:27.488 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
I force myself to forget

00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:31.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
that my own blood relative
was thrown into a sewer,

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:34.127 position:10% line:89% align:start
and just go on about my life.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:37.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] This is all
I've been preparing for.

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.333 position:24% line:89% align:start
Revenge is waiting,

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:43.403 position:7% line:83% align:start
so I can decide my own destiny
and finally satisfy it.

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:47.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ugh, Ermes, can you tell me
this isn't a standoff, right?

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:49.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can't! Get back!
Don't do this!

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm calling F.F. over.

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:54.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's five, no, wait,
seven corpses

breaking through the thread
and moving in on you.

Hmm, how predictable you are.
I knew you'd do that.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Remember you did
the same thing

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you trapped me
in that pipe before.

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:48.101 position:13% line:89% align:start
You used that silly sticker

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.070 position:10% line:83% align:start
that splits anything in two.
Ha-ha!

But you can see,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't fall for
that power anymore.

00:17:54.876 --> 00:17:56.511 position:27% line:89% align:start
Because I, too...

It's happening now!

Even the piece that

bit off and swallowed
will fuse back in.

[Ermes] The jig is up.
I've ID'd your exact location.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:25.933 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm aiming right above that.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:28.903 position:10% line:83% align:start
The median line of your face,
from chin to skull.

00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:40.715 position:30% line:89% align:start
One more thing,

00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:43.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
this last parting gift
is for Gloria. You got it?

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.853 position:13% line:83% align:start
There must have been a bone
in your ugly face

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:46.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
that got crushed before.

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:48.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I think the way
that happened

00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:49.891 position:13% line:83% align:start
was Gloria fought back hard
against you.

00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:51.826 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] And this...

00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:53.628 position:24% line:89% align:start
is also for Gloria!

[grunts]

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:56.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rip that piece of shit
to shreds!

00:19:56.931 --> 00:19:58.265 position:35% line:89% align:start
Do it now!

[zombies moan]

What? Are you gonna
try to hide again?

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:05.338 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't do that anymore,

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.041 position:24% line:83% align:start
because I just put
a sticker on your ugly head

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.910 position:10% line:89% align:start
and split that thing in two.

[zombies grunt]

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:13.480 position:19% line:83% align:start

you'll merge back into one.

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:16.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
This next one is
for Gloria, too.

00:20:19.153 --> 00:20:21.556 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah! And the one
after that as well.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not to mention
the next one after that,

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:27.562 position:24% line:89% align:start
and so on, forever.

They're all for my Gloria!

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:35.335 position:33% line:89% align:start
And this one!

And this one! And this one!

All for Gloria!

Look! I finally cried!

00:21:19.547 --> 00:21:20.915 position:19% line:89% align:start
All I want right now...

00:21:21.816 --> 00:21:24.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
is to sob my eyes out
by your side.

But I don't have time,

left to do it.

Come on! Quickly!

Open this gate for me.

what I need to do here,
