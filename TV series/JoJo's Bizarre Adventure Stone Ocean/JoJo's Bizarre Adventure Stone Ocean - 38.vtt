Two years for
a hit-and-run is nothing.

Did you say 2011?

00:01:40.068 --> 00:01:41.836 position:30% line:83% align:start
Does that mean
we went back in time?

-No, actually.
-[gasps]

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:45.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have traveled
far beyond that point.

00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.141 position:19% line:89% align:start
With accelerated time,

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
we have reached a place
humanity always winds up,

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:52.279 position:16% line:89% align:start
the end of the universe!

[shudders]

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.115 position:33% line:89% align:start
As in life,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
the ending of something
initiates a new beginning.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:00.054 position:7% line:89% align:start
And that is what we call fate.

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:02.189 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even in the universe
after this,

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
our planet will be recreated
and life on Earth

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:07.227 position:13% line:83% align:start
will follow the same path
that it was destined to.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when humanity
comes into existence,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
it'll be the beginning
of a new dawn.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is the promised age

[Father Pucchi]
In this new world,

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.047 position:13% line:83% align:start
the Jolyne Cujoh you knew
exists no longer.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.850 position:24% line:83% align:start
Neither do Jotaro,
Anastasia, nor Ermes.

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:31.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not even their souls

[gasps]

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.188 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that is because
the dead cannot return.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
All of those who perished
in the accelerated time

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.961 position:13% line:89% align:start
have been erased forever.

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:43.230 position:7% line:83% align:start

it's the same but different!

That's fate at work.

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:02.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
This new universe
has reached this point in time

00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:04.205 position:27% line:83% align:start
after repeating
the same history

as the previous universe,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.908 position:27% line:83% align:start
and it shall be
the same here on.

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:08.943 position:19% line:89% align:start
Because that is fate,

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:13.313 position:13% line:83% align:start

certainty, not by coincidence.

it starts to contract,

When it can no longer contract,

[Father Pucchi]
It's Weather Forecast!

00:14:10.084 --> 00:14:12.152 position:10% line:89% align:start
One day, I read in a book...

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.221 position:13% line:89% align:start
that the deadliest poison

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.323 position:27% line:83% align:start
within proximity
of any organism

00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:17.559 position:16% line:89% align:start
is the air they breathe.

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:21.128 position:7% line:83% align:start
Every organism on this planet
needs oxygen to survive.

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:22.930 position:10% line:83% align:start
But the concentration level
of oxygen

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:24.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
can't be above 40 percent.

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.935 position:5% line:83% align:start
One hundred percent pure oxygen
is extremely toxic,

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
and any life form exposed to it
will perish.

00:14:30.505 --> 00:14:32.707 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Highly concentrated levels
of oxygen...

00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:34.676 position:27% line:83% align:start
can corrode iron

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:36.410 position:10% line:89% align:start
and even make fire explode.

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.079 position:10% line:83% align:start
It can also absorb electrons
in the human body,

[Emporio] If you breathe
too much of it,

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:46.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
your hands and feet
will start to go numb,

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.921 position:5% line:89% align:start
and you won't be able to stand.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:49.923 position:16% line:83% align:start
Plus, the tiny veins in
your eyes will snap,

00:14:49.957 --> 00:14:51.225 position:21% line:89% align:start
and you'll go blind.

00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:53.762 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can go ahead and
accelerate time all you want.

00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:57.164 position:10% line:83% align:start
Weather Forecast is a Stand

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:59.801 position:5% line:83% align:start

And now, you'll slowly
lose consciousness

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
as a hundred percent
oxygen seeps

00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:08.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
deeper and deeper

But if I die now,
