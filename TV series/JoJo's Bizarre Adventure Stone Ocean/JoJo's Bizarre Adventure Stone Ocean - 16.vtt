What? Did Jolyne make it?

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
So she can go to
the Discipline Cell

it's the one

The spirit that keeps
on telling me

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.812 position:30% line:83% align:start
to conquer and
destroy everything,

to pull off the same thing
with me

of strength is, FE40536.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.735 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's something flowing
slowly from your muscles

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:03.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
that looks like a thread
made of liquid.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.305 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful.

power you have?

00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:11.279 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] What the hell
kind of move was that?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
When he fought that
other prisoner before,

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:16.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
he was bizarrely brutal
and savage.

00:05:16.217 --> 00:05:18.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
And that was just
a fist fight.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.521 position:30% line:89% align:start
But this is...

00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:22.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
No normal humans
are capable of these moves.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it!

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
I need to beat this guard
at any cost. Right now!

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:30.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all roar]

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.306 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can see his muscles, too.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
And they look brilliant
and beautiful.

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:44.812 position:10% line:83% align:start
Also, the way he just moved.
The agility, the power...

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
How can a human sustain
huge wounds like that,

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:51.118 position:10% line:83% align:start
and ignore that pain and fear
and still attack so viciously?

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:54.322 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if the intense radiance
emanating from his muscles is

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.723 position:13% line:89% align:start
a mark of his strong point,

00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.892 position:33% line:83% align:start
that tells me
something important.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:01.229 position:33% line:83% align:start
His left leg!
I can see inside it right now.

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:03.531 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's the leg
that I just attacked.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
He must be feeling it.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.235 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's what I sense.

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I can tell the damage
I dealt

00:06:09.237 --> 00:06:10.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
is murder for him.

then I totally
should have seen it.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:12.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
Really! Is that the best
you can do?

00:08:12.093 --> 00:08:13.728 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wrap your thread around me?

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can see the thread,
as a matter of fact.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
A bundle of threads
inside your body.

00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:20.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're your point
of strength.

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:22.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
It starts to make
a bit more sense now.

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:24.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
But without them,
you're nothing.

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.141 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's beautiful!

[Westwood]
You're all sparkles and light.

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:37.485 position:30% line:83% align:start
So when did you
become a Stand User?

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
Like yesterday?

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.788 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Or just now?

Ora! Ora!

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne breathes heavily]
I see it!

00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:55.803 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's his Stand!

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:58.939 position:13% line:83% align:start
His Stand finally appeared.
I know what he did now.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:00.875 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:03.844 position:33% line:89% align:start
A Stand User.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.380 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he's the assassin sent
to eliminate me,

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:07.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I have an idea
what I have

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:09.784 position:10% line:89% align:start
to do to eliminate him first.

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.524 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't need extra power
to defend myself with thread.

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:17.391 position:27% line:83% align:start
A straight punch
with devastating force

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:18.759 position:13% line:89% align:start
will deviate significantly

00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:20.194 position:7% line:89% align:start
when the direction is shifted,

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.163 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I'll avoid any impact.

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:25.132 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:26.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
You fell for it!

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:28.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because you used
both of your hands,

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:29.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was able to block
your movement.

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:30.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sorry, dumbass!

00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:31.939 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:33.074 position:33% line:89% align:start

[groans]

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.550 position:10% line:83% align:start

What? Oh, no!

[Jolyne] No, not again!

What's doing this?
Is it a Stand? But how?

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:12.480 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't see it! How can he...

You're mine now!

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:20.354 position:33% line:83% align:start
You low-rent,
filthy piece of shit.

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:23.657 position:13% line:83% align:start
You dared to make fun of me
when you're the real joke here.

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:26.360 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who's laughing now?

00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:28.563 position:33% line:83% align:start
Prisoners are
the scum of society.

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:30.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
And there's nothing
that pisses me off

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:33.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
more than being defied
by a scum queen like you.

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:34.702 position:35% line:89% align:start
By the way,

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.506 position:13% line:83% align:start
I felt like that the entire
time I work in this pit.

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:38.906 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, don't fuck with me, lady.

00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.475 position:21% line:83% align:start

Let it out! Let it out!
Let all my anger out.

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.632 position:19% line:89% align:start
Holy shit! The ceiling?

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:06.535 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no!
That means his Stand is...

No! No way!

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:08.969 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so screwed!

out of this, now!

Oh, no!

Hey, I'm a big prison guard.
Remember?

my right arm is free,

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:04.559 position:7% line:89% align:start
that could probably crush them.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:06.080 position:10% line:89% align:start
Bet you didn't think of that.

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
He probably made more than
three Stand Users

00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:09.883 position:27% line:89% align:start
to take her out.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, you and I are gonna go
track them down,

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
blow their asses off the map

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.356 position:33% line:83% align:start
and then come
straight back here.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:16.691 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sound good?

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:18.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
[scoffs]
Yeah, fine!

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:21.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] I'll be back
before that guard

00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.531 position:35% line:83% align:start
even starts
his pre-wake-up twitching.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.836 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't forget!
We've sealed the deal

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.504 position:24% line:83% align:start
about Jolyne and I
getting married.

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:31.872 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, you'd better
not try to double-cross me.

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.942 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.944 position:13% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Yeah, about that...

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
I still don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:40.314 position:33% line:89% align:start
Enlighten me!

00:14:41.816 --> 00:14:43.917 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense music]

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.589 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:49.456 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screams in pain]

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:51.659 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:54.161 position:24% line:89% align:start
[screams painfully]

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:58.932 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:06.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Wait! It's a meteor.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:08.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's the attack?

00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:10.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
Meteors are falling
toward Earth

00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:11.945 position:13% line:89% align:start
and directly to this guard.

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what was attacking me.

00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:15.850 position:21% line:89% align:start
His Stand pulls down

00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:18.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
goddamn fire ball
asteroids from the sky.

00:15:18.753 --> 00:15:20.588 position:10% line:83% align:start
But they always conveniently
miss him

00:15:20.622 --> 00:15:23.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
and burn to harmless ash.

00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:26.059 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here comes another one,
like it heard me or something.

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:27.361 position:24% line:83% align:start
-But before that...
-[grunts]

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.030 position:44% line:89% align:start
Argh!

00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:31.599 position:35% line:89% align:start
I got you!

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:35.002 position:27% line:83% align:start
And rest assured,
this time I'm not letting go.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.970 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm the winner,
do you hear me?

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:38.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
I shine like a diamond!

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:42.176 position:35% line:83% align:start
I beat you!
I am the strongest here!

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.344 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
Stone Ocean!

00:15:48.917 --> 00:15:49.884 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:51.452 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw, you think that's bad?

00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:54.021 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm about to rip this skin off
your whole body

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:55.989 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screams in pain]

00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.325 position:41% line:83% align:start
Let go!
Right now, you bastard!

00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:00.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let go of me!

00:16:03.765 --> 00:16:04.732 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.134 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:08.402 position:35% line:83% align:start
He let go!
[grunts]

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:13.240 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ora! Ora! Ora!

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:14.542 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.077 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screams in pain]

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.715 position:30% line:89% align:start
[groans, pants]

00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:25.052 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Man, I barely dodged
getting crushed by that thing.

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
I did my best to alter
the meteor's path

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:30.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
so it would nail that
crazy fuck directly.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
But it did the same thing
they've all been doing.

00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:34.729 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's not even one teeny
little scratch on that guy.

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:35.930 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair!

00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:36.965 position:19% line:89% align:start
When they got near him,

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
they just disintegrate
into dust.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
That guard's Stand power
is so intense.

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:44.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
He magnetizes meteors falling

00:16:44.506 --> 00:16:46.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
right toward his body
and he's fine.

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.442 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:51.044 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, no matter what I do
or how I do it,

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:52.514 position:30% line:83% align:start
when I have to
get close to it,

00:16:52.547 --> 00:16:53.581 position:21% line:89% align:start
somehow the only one

00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:57.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
who's in any actual
danger of getting hit is me.

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:59.286 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, this is kind of crazy.

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.388 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tons of flaming stones
are crashing down

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.658 position:13% line:83% align:start
from the sky all around me,
everywhere.

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:05.994 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wait! Are they meteors, then?

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:09.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is that what my point
of strength is? [chuckles]

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.466 position:33% line:83% align:start
-So, FE40536.
-[pants]

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.802 position:30% line:83% align:start
How many times
did you get hit, cupcake?

00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:17.070 position:27% line:83% align:start
Those wounds look
pretty nasty.

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:19.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
I see both arms,

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:22.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
your left side
and your right leg.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.478 position:21% line:89% align:start
Five gashes in total.

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:25.880 position:33% line:89% align:start
Or is it six?

00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:27.047 position:19% line:89% align:start
Does it really matter?

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
The next one is gonna be
the money shot,

00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:31.218 position:21% line:89% align:start
the good night kiss.

00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:34.022 position:30% line:89% align:start
[effort grunts]

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.524 position:30% line:89% align:start
[upbeat music]

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.361 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh, you're serious?

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
Lady, you are bleeding out.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.298 position:30% line:83% align:start
How do you even
have the strength

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
to move right now,
much less stand?

00:17:46.935 --> 00:17:48.335 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nah, you're bluffing, sister.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.437 position:35% line:83% align:start
Any minute,
you're bricks on the floor.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.472 position:10% line:89% align:start
Your arms are about as useful

00:17:52.507 --> 00:17:54.609 position:30% line:83% align:start
for fighting as
a pair of wet ankle socks.

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:57.210 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't stand a chance
and you know it.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.682 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can see your muscle tissues
rotting and dying.

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:02.416 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's all dark like your heart.

00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:04.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
None of them have that
brilliant sparkle

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:05.954 position:33% line:89% align:start
like before.

00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:08.488 position:30% line:83% align:start
What do you say
we go another round?

00:18:08.523 --> 00:18:10.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
Okay, just to see
how damaged you are,

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:13.661 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll bite! Let's play. Ready?

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:16.764 position:24% line:89% align:start
[grunts, chuckles]

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:19.466 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, huh?

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:22.737 position:19% line:83% align:start
Go! Take a swing at me.
I'm defenseless.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you waiting for?

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:27.441 position:38% line:83% align:start
[laughs]
Come and get me, tiger!

00:18:27.474 --> 00:18:29.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
What kind of strike
you gonna use?

00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:33.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey, maybe I should close
my eyes, too. [cackling]

00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:35.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:41.656 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Yes, there it is!

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:43.791 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's the bone I need.

00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:46.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
The same one that Pale Snake
is looking for. I found it.

00:18:46.794 --> 00:18:49.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's right over there.
I have to get to it.

00:18:49.931 --> 00:18:51.231 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.332 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:56.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You can't fight anymore!
-[grunts]

00:18:56.236 --> 00:18:58.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have a feeling you put
your back against the wall

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:00.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
to shield yourself
from falling meteors.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.276 position:38% line:83% align:start
But hey,
it sure did work out for me!

00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:05.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:08.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
The meteors were
already falling towards me

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:10.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the other side
of the wall! You lose!

00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:13.821 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:16.490 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[exclaims]
-[grunts]

00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:18.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
I win!

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
Turns out I was right
on the money.

00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:21.796 position:19% line:83% align:start
That tight little body
is too wrecked

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:24.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
to defend my attack,
and now you're gonna die.

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:28.301 position:21% line:83% align:start
How does it go again?
"One prisoner sees the wall.

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:30.805 position:10% line:89% align:start
But the other side of it is,

00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:33.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the other sees
the stars through the bars."

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.277 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Which one am I?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here's the last blow.
Take that!

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:43.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] There's the bone
over there.

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:47.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I can just get
to Pale Snake,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.222 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.626 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can drink filthy water.

00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:54.696 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll finally become stronger
than anyone else.

00:19:57.932 --> 00:19:59.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
Scummy bitch!

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's too late now!

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:04.605 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll never be able to avoid
the meteors anymore.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Of course,
I'll see the stars.

00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:10.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
Until I see my father again,

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:13.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
I only want to gaze
into their fierce light.

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:17.118 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, this is it! Good grief.

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:19.854 position:7% line:89% align:start
Here comes the finishing blow!

00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:22.657 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Westwood] It's over!

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.291 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne]
It's gonna vaporize me.

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:25.893 position:21% line:89% align:start
The fatal last blow.

00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:29.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
I can't defend myself anymore,
not even with Stone Ocean.

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:35.069 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm the strongest!
And now, you're gonna die!

00:20:35.103 --> 00:20:36.269 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Jolyne] Not yet!
-Huh?

00:20:37.138 --> 00:20:38.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
While you're so busy
being awesome,

00:20:38.973 --> 00:20:40.208 position:13% line:89% align:start
I took off your right boot.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:44.478 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sneaky little shit bag.

00:20:48.783 --> 00:20:51.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
She even filled my boot with
broken pieces of the brick.

00:20:51.853 --> 00:20:53.386 position:13% line:89% align:start
Shit! She's getting pelted,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.922 position:30% line:83% align:start
but now taking
a lot less damage?

00:20:57.058 --> 00:20:58.492 position:19% line:89% align:start
The energy has shifted.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:03.231 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Argh!
-[grunts]

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
The meteors will burn out.

00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:08.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
They might come close,
but they'll never hit you.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
Except, that only goes
for the meteors, right?

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:13.373 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Westwood] Urgh! My boot!

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.344 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:21:18.746 --> 00:21:22.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
Good grief. Just stop
being such a drama queen.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.719 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
You filthy rotten criminal!

00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:29.590 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stone Ocean!

00:21:35.295 --> 00:21:38.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Westwood] What...
What's wrong with her?

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's like she's never
satisfied with anything.

00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:44.872 position:19% line:89% align:start
She refuses to give up.

00:21:45.773 --> 00:21:46.641 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not fair.

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:49.677 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, I know if something else

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.411 position:30% line:83% align:start
manages to hit
the meteor first,

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:53.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
then it can actually get me.

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:55.883 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm in horrible shit, now.

00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:58.286 position:10% line:83% align:start
How could you be so violent,
so cruel to me?

00:21:58.318 --> 00:21:59.452 position:33% line:89% align:start
How dare you!

00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:01.889 position:24% line:89% align:start
This bitch beat me.

00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:04.225 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathes heavily]

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:06.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Looks like
I'll see the stars.

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:08.361 position:35% line:89% align:start
[swooshing]

00:22:13.734 --> 00:22:17.505 position:24% line:83% align:start
Game set and match!
