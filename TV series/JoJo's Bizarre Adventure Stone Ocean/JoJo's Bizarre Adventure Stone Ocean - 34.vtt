[woman] What the hell is wrong
with these eggs?

00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:11.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Father Pucchi] My Stand...

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:14.147 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't the vaguest idea
what it is,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it's painfully clear
that it's no longer Pale Snake.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is it? What could it be?

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:23.725 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel terrible...

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:27.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
Something is quickly raging
out of control inside of me.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.062 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's some kind of
independent power

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.732 position:16% line:89% align:start
that's ignoring my will.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.736 position:35% line:83% align:start
But oddly,
I feel hope in this power.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.105 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hope, in fact, is the one
and only thing I feel from it.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
Dio's note recorded
in Jotaro's memories...

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:44.746 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perhaps that is what I need
to control this power, then.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.214 position:21% line:89% align:start
The time and place...

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.918 position:30% line:83% align:start
North latitude,
28 degrees 24 minutes.

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.620 position:30% line:83% align:start
West longitude,
80 degrees 36 minutes.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:56.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
Delightful. Heaven appears
to be there, after all,

00:00:56.223 --> 00:01:00.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
and that place is
at Cape Canaveral Space Center,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.361 position:30% line:89% align:start
to be precise.

[dramatic music]

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.869 position:7% line:83% align:start
At the beginning of everything,
there was gravity.

00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:10.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even this round Earth of ours

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
was brought into reality
with gravity.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:14.374 position:24% line:89% align:start

We're not falling down,
we're falling backwards!

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.053 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] No, this can't be! Is
this the priest's new ability?

[Father Pucchi] And with
its gravitational pull,

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
the Earth continues
to revolve around the Sun!

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.810 position:27% line:83% align:start
The question that
still remains is,

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:50.778 position:30% line:83% align:start
where on earth
am I headed now?

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.479 position:10% line:89% align:start
What is going to happen next?

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.716 position:10% line:89% align:start
I knew my old man sealed away

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:56.884 position:21% line:83% align:start
some sort of ability
in Egypt 20 years ago,

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:58.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
but this is insane!

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:02.255 position:10% line:83% align:start
This must be the "heaven" the
priest has been searching for!

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.827 position:16% line:83% align:start
Within my body and spirit
lies the existence of gravity,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
and it shall also exist
at the end of the world!

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.766 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's our way
into the Visitor Center.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.069 position:7% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, are you sure the priest
is still in this direction?

00:02:15.103 --> 00:02:17.605 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's close, yeah.
I can sense him right here.

[menacing music]

[Emporio]
This is the priest's Stand?

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:32.654 position:21% line:89% align:start

[metal clunks]

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
It must be his attacks, like
from when his fist grazed us,

00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:27.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
but it barely made contact.

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:30.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, if he punches us,
we'll be in big trouble.

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:33.134 position:7% line:89% align:start
Gravity, judging by everything

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
that's been happening
around us...

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
This probably has to do
with gravity too, Jolyne.

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:39.874 position:19% line:83% align:start
Whether it be an apple
or the planet itself,

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:42.176 position:24% line:83% align:start
everything on Earth
is affected by gravity,

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.744 position:7% line:89% align:start
and all of it is pulled towards

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.613 position:35% line:83% align:start
the Earth's
gravitational center!

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the natural law
of the universe.

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:50.551 position:13% line:83% align:start
Except, this guy's ability
messes with that.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
It makes the gravity
go in the opposite direction!

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.955 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why whenever
his Stand's fists

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:55.857 position:10% line:89% align:start
make contact with something,

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.457 position:24% line:89% align:start
it'll be inverted!

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I don't know how far,
but with everything sideways,

00:06:00.328 --> 00:06:01.863 position:16% line:89% align:start
we're gonna keep falling.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:02.997 position:30% line:89% align:start
So this is it.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.867 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thanks to the unique energy
around Cape Canaveral,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
the priest has somehow
developed a new Stand.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's no longer Pale Snake

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
which had the ability
to manipulate memories,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.810 position:7% line:83% align:start
nor does it have the ability to
split itself in half infinitely

like the Green Baby.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.296 position:16% line:83% align:start

to let him hit me again

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
so that I can flip myself
back to normal.

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:13.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
So he can invert me
all he wants to...

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.103 position:16% line:83% align:start
'cause I'll just hit him

there's one thing I'm sure of.

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.658 position:7% line:83% align:start

hit him, he'll take damage.

What's up with his movements?

00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:52.166 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Judging by its power,

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.602 position:27% line:83% align:start
I thought it'd be
an automated pursuit Stand,

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:56.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
but his attacks
are way too precise!

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:58.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
And he's not focused

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.641 position:33% line:83% align:start
on attacking
my arms or legs anymore,

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.743 position:13% line:89% align:start
like he knows it's useless.

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
So he's only pinpointing
my vital areas

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.447 position:19% line:89% align:start
like my face and chest,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
knowing that if his fist
touched me there,

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:09.083 position:30% line:89% align:start
it'll be fatal!

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:12.153 position:19% line:89% align:start
Plus, he dodged my kick

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:14.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
and managed to get out
of the way by just millimeters!

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.259 position:35% line:83% align:start
Which means,
this is a remote control Stan!

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:21.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:23.230 position:21% line:83% align:start
The priest has to be
around here

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:24.999 position:13% line:89% align:start
watching with his own eyes.

00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:27.835 position:13% line:83% align:start
In other words, his Stand's
movements are so accurate

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.303 position:21% line:83% align:start
because he's watching
every attack!

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
This guy's Stand
causes destruction

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:33.508 position:16% line:89% align:start
by manipulating gravity,

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:36.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it just seems
like he's powerful.

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:39.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
Where is he? I thought Pucchi
would be hiding far away,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.882 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I get the sense that he's
a lot closer than I realized.

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:45.252 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's somewhere close by
with a clear view of the area!

What the hell, Jolyne?
What are you doing?

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:18.185 position:10% line:89% align:start
Anastasia, I bet if you try,

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:20.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
you could probably jump
onto the tiles

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:21.388 position:16% line:89% align:start
on the side of the road.

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:24.492 position:7% line:83% align:start

of that rope, okay?

00:10:24.526 --> 00:10:26.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
With your weight
tightening the rope,

00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:27.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
his Stand's being held down

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:29.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
and getting the life
choked out of him.

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:31.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
And he doesn't have
the power to fight back.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:33.602 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's completely defenseless!

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.738 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh! No freaking way!

00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:38.739 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Stand's desperately
trying to grab

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
onto Jolyne's rope
with his hands

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:43.077 position:7% line:89% align:start
before it gets choked to death!

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.713 position:7% line:83% align:start
If this thing manages to get a
hold of those threads of yours

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:46.947 position:19% line:89% align:start
with its hands, Jolyne,

00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:50.184 position:10% line:83% align:start
the rope's gonna get inverted
and break away!

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.219 position:27% line:83% align:start
Get that rope off
of its neck, Jolyne.

00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:53.187 position:35% line:89% align:start
Do it now!

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.655 position:19% line:89% align:start
This was a distraction.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.525 position:38% line:83% align:start
I did it
so you can get away from him!

00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:57.958 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't, Anastasia.

00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.460 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
I'm running away from this now.

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:01.662 position:7% line:89% align:start
With this rope around its neck,

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
we finally have
a chance to end him!

00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:06.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
And for the record, I'm not
actually trying to choke it.

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm just trying to get closer

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.137 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I can pummel him
to the pavement!

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.206 position:33% line:83% align:start
What exactly
are you saying, Jolyne?

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:14.241 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he lays even a finger
on your thick rope,

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:16.243 position:16% line:83% align:start
and it ends up inverting
everything attached to it,

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:18.112 position:13% line:83% align:start
that means your entire arm

Invincibility.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.125 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is that the power I've obtained

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:47.127 position:19% line:83% align:start
even before the coming
of the new moon?

However, I must keep on
telling myself

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:53.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
it is not power which I desire,

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:56.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
but rather, what I truly long
for is the ultimate happiness

that every human being
has the potential to achieve.

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:01.308 position:13% line:89% align:start
And Jolyne Cujoh was merely

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:02.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
a sacrificial pawn towards
that end.

that... that Pucchi knows.
