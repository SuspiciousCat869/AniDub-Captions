What's going on with you?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.947 position:13% line:83% align:start
I remember this happening
around me once before,

00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:02.016 position:16% line:89% align:start
in my hometown in 1988.

Say what?

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.053 position:7% line:89% align:start
It would seem, this freak show

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:07.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
represents the dark side
of my heart.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.991 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your memories...
They really are back.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
So you remember everything now?

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:16.263 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then get your act together
and do something about this!

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Weather] I have no control
over this ability.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.835 position:19% line:83% align:start
Though if you kill me,
the Stand's power should stop.

[gasps]

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:24.237 position:16% line:83% align:start
I do kinda feel bad for
the snail people,

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.708 position:27% line:83% align:start
but a part of me
hates living even more,

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that part is enjoying
the hell out of this.

00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.212 position:24% line:83% align:start
Somewhere down in
the deepest recesses

of my heart,
I feel some relief.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:36.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
To be honest,
I'm sort of glad this happened.

-Huh.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.124 position:7% line:89% align:start
But Jolyne... If she's nearby,

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:45.126 position:21% line:83% align:start
could she be turning
into a snail too?

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.828 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'd better not
move carelessly.

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have no idea
how all this works,

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.699 position:33% line:83% align:start
but judging
by what I can see,

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's likely that touching
these snails

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.103 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the trigger to
this phenomenon.

At this point,
my only hope for staying alive

for his own selfish desires
to come to fruition,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.041 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll settle it all.

Fine, whatever.

[Father Pucchi] The method
of cleverly arranging

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:02.309 position:16% line:89% align:start
hidden words on a poster

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:04.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
that cannot be noticed
at first glance,

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:06.847 position:10% line:83% align:start
or a single frame containing
an image that has been clipped

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:08.783 position:13% line:89% align:start
into the film of a movie,

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:12.053 position:7% line:83% align:start
the average person is unaware
of ever having seen the image,

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
but without a doubt,
it becomes carved

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:16.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
into their deep consciousness
and lingers there.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's what psychologists refer
to as subliminal messaging

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.363 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the effect it has
on the subconscious.

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:24.198 position:27% line:83% align:start
Things or images
that are instinctive

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:26.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
penetrate much further
into one's consciousness

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:28.302 position:24% line:83% align:start
more than if they
are witnessed directly.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:29.670 position:16% line:89% align:start
And as a result of this,

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:32.541 position:5% line:83% align:start
they control what an individual
may decide to do.

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now, the rainbows
Weather Forecast conjured

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:35.876 position:10% line:89% align:start

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.278 position:30% line:83% align:start
it's becoming
a subliminal message

00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:38.979 position:16% line:89% align:start
at an atmospheric level.

00:09:39.013 --> 00:09:40.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
And whenever they lay
their eyes on them,

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:43.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's entering the souls
of the townspeople!

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.787 position:7% line:83% align:start
Is it because images of snails
are being projected onto them?

00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:50.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or could it be because it
stimulates primitive instincts?

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:52.527 position:24% line:83% align:start
Everyone who looks
at the rainbow starts to think

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:55.129 position:30% line:83% align:start
that they too
will become snails.

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:56.597 position:13% line:89% align:start
And these intense thoughts

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
affect the subjects
physically as well.

was completely unaffected,

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.717 position:27% line:83% align:start

So what are you gonna choose?

00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:06.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have the option
to continue this

00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:08.429 position:5% line:89% align:start
without the use of your vision.

00:12:08.462 --> 00:12:10.931 position:21% line:83% align:start
And the other option
that you have to choose from

00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:13.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
is seeing what's going on
with your own eyes.

00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:16.036 position:13% line:83% align:start

it's over for you.

00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:23.911 position:35% line:89% align:start

You're done, Pucchi.

00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:35.956 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no way you're gonna
escape from this.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you gonna bring
your eyesight back?

00:12:37.726 --> 00:12:39.026 position:24% line:89% align:start
Go ahead and try!

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.762 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll just reflect the rainbows
straight into your face!

00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:42.896 position:16% line:89% align:start
If Weather can grab you,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.332 position:16% line:83% align:start
your chances of survival
are slim to none!

In terms of power, Pale Snake
is simply outclassed!

let me go peacefully.

There are eyes for me
to see out of from all over.

00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:12.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how I was able
to come here.

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:15.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anastasia, may I use you
for a moment?

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:18.432 position:7% line:83% align:start
You shall act as a substitute
for my eyes.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.468 position:7% line:83% align:start
Would you kindly relate to me
what you see in front of you?

00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:24.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
Specifically, the things
that are dangerous to me.

00:13:24.572 --> 00:13:26.373 position:19% line:83% align:start
What is Weather doing
currently?

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:30.144 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's hardening
his own blood to create

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:33.213 position:10% line:83% align:start
a few dozen spears all over
the ground around you.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.949 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are three of them
placed directly behind you.

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:38.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then to your right, there are
four more lying in wait.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:38.852 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:40.588 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:42.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, be a good boy
and guide me out

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.991 position:33% line:83% align:start
of this maze
of blood spears, okay?

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:46.360 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please continue.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:48.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you take three steps,
you will meet six spears.

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.098 position:7% line:83% align:start
From there, you're gonna want
to take a hard left.

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:55.302 position:38% line:89% align:start
Weather.

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:57.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
From the very moment
you were born,

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:58.405 position:13% line:89% align:start
a curse has afflicted you.

No matter what
you attempt to do,

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
there is no salvation
for your life.

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:08.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
The memories I sealed away

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.685 position:5% line:83% align:start
should never have been returned
to you in the first place.

[snarls]

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.922 position:16% line:83% align:start
Continue going left for
five steps, then face right.

00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:17.124 position:16% line:83% align:start
After that, you're free
from any danger.

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:19.426 position:13% line:89% align:start
Splendid. Five more steps.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.596 position:21% line:89% align:start
Correct. Just five.

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:23.598 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is something
I just realized.

00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:25.432 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I saw it, so I'll tell you.

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.068 position:7% line:89% align:start
One more spear still remains.

[Father Pucchi] Hmm?

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:30.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was only looking
at the ground,

00:14:30.772 --> 00:14:31.939 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I didn't notice before.

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's some blood
on your shoulder.

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:36.243 position:21% line:89% align:start
And right about now,

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
Weather's hardening it
into another spear.

Oops, it's too late.

I have to dodge just one blow.

If I can dodge it,

00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.808 position:19% line:83% align:start

It's useless to resist!

That attack's nothing
to Weather.

He can dodge it easily!

[Father Pucchi] Yes,
I have no doubt that he will.

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:21.823 position:13% line:83% align:start
But then, the direction of
his wind pressure will change.

00:15:21.856 --> 00:15:23.123 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's my chance to flee!

00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:38.693 position:21% line:89% align:start
He used that moment

00:22:38.726 --> 00:22:40.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
to seal his ability
into a disc.

[Emporio] Hey, Jolyne...

00:22:44.431 --> 00:22:46.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think Weather
entrusted this to you.

[gasps]

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.708 position:13% line:89% align:start
Weather came back to life

00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:56.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
when he finally escaped
from that prison.

00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:57.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that's the proof
he left for you.

00:23:00.748 --> 00:23:03.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
In his final few days,
he was happy.

00:23:04.652 --> 00:23:06.821 position:5% line:89% align:start
Weather had already been saved!

00:23:10.224 --> 00:23:10.925 position:35% line:89% align:start
Weather...

00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:13.828 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.665 position:27% line:89% align:start
One more time...

00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

00:23:19.033 --> 00:23:22.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanna speak with you
just one more time.

00:23:22.737 --> 00:23:24.071 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sniffles]

00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:26.173 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just once more,

00:23:26.207 --> 00:23:29.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
[sniffles] I wanna talk to you
in the soft breeze.
