That's why whenever
his Stand's fists

[Ermes] Courtesy of
the Speedwagon Foundation,

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
we fired this spear from
three kilometers up in the air

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.202 position:33% line:83% align:start
and managed
to drive it straight

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
into the ground here
at the Visitor Center.

[groaning]

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
Using my Stand, Smack,

00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:16.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
I made it so the one spear
split into two.

00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:17.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
And when I peel
the sticker off,

00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
it tried its best
to come back together.

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:22.416 position:21% line:83% align:start
As long as I held on
to the spear,

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:24.117 position:24% line:83% align:start
it still pulled me
three kilometers

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.385 position:16% line:89% align:start
towards the other spear

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:28.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
at an extremely fast rate,
regardless of gravity.

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:30.424 position:13% line:83% align:start
I used the same principle
to get here

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
by dividing the spear
a few more times,

00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:35.362 position:10% line:83% align:start
all while following where he
sensed that Jolyne was located.

[Emporio] We finally got you
surrounded, Father Pucchi.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:57.986 position:16% line:83% align:start
The idea that your Stand

is just your twisted fantasy.

00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:04.224 position:24% line:89% align:start
This game is over.

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:06.961 position:7% line:83% align:start
You don't have any more allies
to help you.

00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:09.296 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you won't ever be able
to see the new moon.

test to prove my worthiness!

00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:27.615 position:7% line:83% align:start

became exactly what I needed.

00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:28.616 position:33% line:89% align:start
In the end,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.051 position:19% line:83% align:start

is here to lend me aid!

thrown into this frame,

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:51.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
floating up towards the sky?

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:55.510 position:10% line:83% align:start
As I said before, gravity is
working with me as its center!

00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:59.146 position:10% line:83% align:start
I understand everything now,

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.582 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is it.

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:01.883 position:16% line:89% align:start
I no longer need to wait

00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:04.084 position:27% line:83% align:start
for the new moon
to arrive in 36 hours.

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:06.721 position:24% line:83% align:start
If what I require
for this to work

00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:07.956 position:10% line:89% align:start
is the gravitational effect

00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:10.357 position:27% line:83% align:start
which is created
during the new moon,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
then all I have to do
is stay afloat

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
and keep rising until
I can discover

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:16.931 position:33% line:83% align:start
those exact
gravitational conditions!

00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
And from there,
I'll have found it.

as the new moon!

In order for my See Moon

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:24.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
there must be
an optimal position

00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:26.273 position:13% line:89% align:start
with which it'll activate!

we were gonna let you get away?

who've been helping
to raise me up all along.

so I may not walk down
the wrong path!

It is to your very will
that I shall dedicate myself!
