[woman] Father...

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:13.247 position:16% line:83% align:start
After spending some time
behind these stone walls,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've come to realize
how foolish I was in the past.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
My desire to steal
consumed me,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
and from there
I lost all control.

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.657 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[chewing loudly]
-I am deeply ashamed.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's all thanks to you,
Father.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[chewing continues]
-And so...

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.029 position:27% line:83% align:start
May I please have
your assistance

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
in receiving early parole?

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
Recent studies show...
[clears throat]

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
...that if they receive
the proper training,

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
animals such as dogs
and parrots can learn

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:42.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
to read, use fire,
and even appreciate art.

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:43.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
If that's truly the case,

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:46.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
then what's the difference
between humans and animals?

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:48.750 position:33% line:89% align:start
Do you know?

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:51.251 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah, of course.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, I don't see
how that relates...

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:55.055 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah... Just a moment.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.424 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[exhales] Father?
-It's done.

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:00.762 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:02.664 position:27% line:89% align:start
[confused exhale]

00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:04.197 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have you ever tried this?

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
The challenge comes after
completing the first cherry

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.168 position:10% line:89% align:start
with it still in your mouth.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.204 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, which tooth must you use
to bite into the second?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
If accidentally bit
the first seed

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.976 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you went through
the trouble of completing,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:15.944 position:21% line:89% align:start
it wouldn't end well.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:17.110 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh...

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:20.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, sorry Father,
but about my parole?

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.115 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.284 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think there
is a possibility.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you really mean it,
Father?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will be sure to put in
a good word

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.556 position:13% line:89% align:start
for you with the committee.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.325 position:27% line:83% align:start
[relieved exhale]
Thank you very much. [gasps]

[thuds]

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.699 position:24% line:89% align:start
I've taken a liking

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
to those mischievous hands.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your ill-natured self
will never be fixed.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
But... I cannot ignore
the talents you possess.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.779 position:33% line:83% align:start
They will be
of much use to me.

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:54.782 position:7% line:83% align:start
By no means can Jotaro's Stand
leave this prison,

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.585 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I will leave the task
of preventing that to you.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.586 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whirring]

[slurps]

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.097 position:13% line:89% align:start
What? The hell do you mean

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
you had F.F. hide it
somewhere for you?

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all that effort it took
to get it?

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.636 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's got your Dad's Stand
on it!

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.971 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sure that's okay?

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.371 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you even know where it is?

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.439 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean, they're still in...

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.308 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[F.F.] This place is so fun!
-Hm?

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
Compared to the swamp,
it's lovely!

00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:03.945 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.615 position:27% line:83% align:start
We should do what
they're doing over there.

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.316 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think it's called
playing catch, right?

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:12.653 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Look, I trust F.F.

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:14.689 position:19% line:89% align:start
And as far as we know,

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pale Snake has no clue
our new friend's alive.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.026 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's safer this way.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.561 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, guess you're right.

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.263 position:16% line:89% align:start
But look at it like this,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
wouldn't it be even better
to send it

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
to the people
holding your dad?

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:26.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MNS] It would.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:29.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thing is, I tried to escape,

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.404 position:30% line:83% align:start
so my phone and
visitor privileges are gone,

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.808 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I still haven't come up
with a plan to carry it out.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:41.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
Take that
out of your mouth now!

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? What did you just
say to me?

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:45.953 position:19% line:83% align:start
I replenish my thirst,
and you hurl insults?

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:47.622 position:21% line:89% align:start
Put the cup down now.

Immediately!

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:51.692 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it's that important
to you,

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.293 position:19% line:83% align:start
you shouldn't leave it
sitting around.

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.781 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it doesn't have
to be money, you know?

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:55.750 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll take drugs, cigarettes,
chewing gum,

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:58.819 position:27% line:83% align:start
some phone time,
hell, even a vibrator...

00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:01.289 position:33% line:83% align:start
Anything with
a bit of value will do.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll be frank with you.

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:05.126 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't really do bets,
so get lost.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:06.493 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Wait just a second.

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:06.894 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on, Jolyne.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should go along
with this.

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.333 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've got some crazy luck.

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
And whatever you don't have,
I'll lend you.

00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:16.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
F.F. sucks at throwing,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
but they've managed to do it
87 times.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.241 position:35% line:89% align:start
We can win.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:20.975 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's more to it than that!

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:21.976 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
It might be a trap set
by Pale Snake, right?

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:26.414 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I know that Miraschon.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.649 position:38% line:83% align:start
We're on
the same floor together.

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:31.018 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's a stupid gambler
that ruined her life

00:07:31.052 --> 00:07:32.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
committing small robberies.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.755 position:16% line:89% align:start
Think about it for a sec.

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:37.591 position:13% line:83% align:start
When you're finally able to
use the phones and get visits,

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.627 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're definitely gonna wish
you had this money

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.095 position:13% line:89% align:start
to buy your place in line.

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:42.530 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Miraschon] Hey.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.464 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you in, or are you not?

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.466 position:33% line:83% align:start
Count me in.
I wanna do it for sure!

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.268 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can totally win!

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.869 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[dings]
-Okay!

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
But do you even have
a hundred dollars on you?

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:52.239 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whoosh]

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.714 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll play, but conditions
are if you raise your voice

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
or move even one step
from that spot,

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
the bet is called off.
Got it?

00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:06.120 position:35% line:83% align:start
So the game
has already begun then, huh?

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I won't be fair
if the distance is too close

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.725 position:27% line:83% align:start
or if you hold on
to the ball for too long.

00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:12.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
More than three meters apart.

00:08:12.727 --> 00:08:13.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
Within ten seconds.

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:16.831 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[dings]
-Okay.

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:20.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
[chuckling] All right!
Let's get this thing started!

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:22.570 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just calm down
before you throw.

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've got ten seconds,
so take your time!

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.376 position:24% line:89% align:start
And that makes 89!

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:31.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
[chuckes] Now there's
only 11 more to go!

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:32.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasps] You little...!

00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:35.483 position:16% line:83% align:start
Get those sticky fingers
the hell away from my water!

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:36.784 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Hey!

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:38.853 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:41.122 position:24% line:83% align:start
[grunts nervously]
Way to close.

00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:42.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
Concentrate, damn it!

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:43.791 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's not it!

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:45.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's the problem here!

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.129 position:27% line:83% align:start
What is she doing
getting near my water?

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:50.064 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm just spectating quietly.

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:52.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, do it away
from my cup, or else!

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.268 position:19% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Fine, whatever.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.603 position:27% line:89% align:start
Clock's ticking.

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
Go, F.F.! Throw the ball!

00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.540 position:27% line:83% align:start
Screw this girl!
She bugging me!

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:01.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
Here! I'll hold your water.
Now throw the ball!

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:03.310 position:33% line:83% align:start
-One second.
-Throw it!

00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:04.612 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shit!

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:07.048 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-Idiot!

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.915 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.217 position:30% line:89% align:start
[yelps in pain]

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:11.085 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:12.787 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jolyne!

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:12.920 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.359 position:30% line:83% align:start
That was close,
but you pulled through.

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.494 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.
I panicked back there.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:22.463 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.765 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] Be more
careful next time, F.F.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Yeah, right,
I'm fine now.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.938 position:35% line:83% align:start
Here we go!
That was a hundred times!

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:31.972 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[dings]
-Okay.

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:33.874 position:30% line:83% align:start
[cocky chuckle]
With the way I'm feeling,

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:35.876 position:21% line:83% align:start
a hundred more times
sounds like a breeze too.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was an easy win
like I thought.

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:39.613 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, fork over
the hundred dollars.

00:09:39.647 --> 00:09:40.815 position:21% line:89% align:start
No. You were betting

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:42.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
with F.F. earlier too,
weren't you?

00:09:42.517 --> 00:09:44.151 position:21% line:83% align:start
So doesn't that mean
it should be 200?

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:46.921 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yeah, true!
It definitely should be 200.

00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.122 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and give it to me.

00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.824 position:41% line:89% align:start
[dings]

00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:52.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've got a grand on you
not being able to do it again.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.061 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
What, did you not hear me?

00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:59.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you
my bet is 1000 dollars.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:03.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you for real? Do you even
have that kind of cash?

00:10:03.404 --> 00:10:04.605 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:06.107 position:16% line:89% align:start
But like I said earlier,

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.343 position:16% line:83% align:start
anything with value will
do the trick just the same.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.479 position:13% line:83% align:start
The rules remain unchanged
as well.

00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:12.413 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sound good?

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.647 position:30% line:89% align:start
[solemn exhale]

00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:16.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] No, we're done
with your games. [gasps]

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.418 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne grunts]

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:18.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
We might've just won,

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.288 position:33% line:83% align:start
but honestly,
I don't like you one bit.

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:22.890 position:30% line:89% align:start
[amused exhale]

00:10:22.923 --> 00:10:24.658 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you wanna bet,
take it somewhere else.

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:25.793 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll go instead of her!

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:27.328 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[dings]
-Well, okay.

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:28.696 position:35% line:89% align:start
F's, here.

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:30.364 position:13% line:89% align:start
Give me the ball and glove!

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:31.732 position:33% line:89% align:start
On it! Ermes!

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Jolyne.

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't like this chick
all that much either.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
Or the way she's oddly fixated
on betting.

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:39.273 position:33% line:89% align:start
But still...

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.810 position:27% line:83% align:start
If it's gonna be
twelve hundred dollars

00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:44.044 position:13% line:89% align:start
including the earlier bet,

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.679 position:30% line:83% align:start
there's no way
we can pass this up.

00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:47.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Miraschon] You might wanna
be careful.

00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:49.316 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MNS] Like the rules of
the last game,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.253 position:30% line:83% align:start
this one began
the moment you decided to play.

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:53.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've less than ten seconds.

00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:55.356 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Throw it!
-Coming your way!

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
[cocky laugh]
It's another easy victory!

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.027 position:24% line:89% align:start
[concerned exhale]

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[door buzzing]
-[F.F.] Thirty.

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:08.969 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thirty one.

00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:10.938 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thirty two.

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.307 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nice! Next we'll be at 33!

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:15.577 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.412 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's enough!
Put away the gear already!

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:20.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
Today's exercise period
is over!

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:22.816 position:30% line:89% align:start
[light chatter]

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.418 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Five seconds.
-[grunts]

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.754 position:19% line:89% align:start
[grumbles] F's, catch!

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:27.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Thirty three!

00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:29.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
The hell's your damage?

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:30.724 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're not gonna
have ourselves

00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:32.026 position:19% line:89% align:start
a problem here, are we?

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:32.927 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, you!

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.429 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're calling this bet off!
It's done!

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:36.897 position:44% line:83% align:start
Okay,
here's a thought for you.

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:38.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's suppose for
a moment now,

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
that a meteorite fell from
the heavens out of nowhere.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.170 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sure it's wild,

00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:45.674 position:10% line:83% align:start
but you'd probably think that
the game should be called off,

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:46.874 position:21% line:89% align:start
like it's just over.

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:48.742 position:38% line:83% align:start
You'd say
it's the meteor's fault.

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:50.878 position:19% line:83% align:start
And not to convince me,
mind you,

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:52.913 position:30% line:89% align:start
but yourselves.

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:55.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
But are you sure
that's okay?

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't you think you two
might have

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.319 position:16% line:89% align:start
run out of exercise time,

00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:00.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
because you were taking
your sweet time

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:01.422 position:27% line:83% align:start
and deliberately
throwing the ball slowly?

00:12:01.455 --> 00:12:02.691 position:38% line:89% align:start
[hisses]

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:04.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
Take a good look into
your heart and you'll see.

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.760 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it's telling you
you didn't break any rules,

00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:07.761 position:16% line:89% align:start
there's no need to worry.

00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:09.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
By all means,

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:11.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
if you're innocent, you can
stop the game at any time.

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.034 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Fuck you.
-That's it, Ermes.

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:16.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
Be prepared to be sent
to solitary confinement.

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:20.741 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, Mr. Guard.

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:21.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just this once.

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:24.245 position:33% line:83% align:start
Five minutes.
No, three will do.

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
Two minutes. I'm gonna go
make my rounds over here.

00:12:28.683 --> 00:12:30.217 position:24% line:89% align:start
F's, now! Hurry up!

[gasps]

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:33.921 position:16% line:83% align:start
But a measly 100 dollars
will only go so far.

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:36.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd say it only covers
the ball.

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:39.126 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be taking that glove.
Give it here!

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.494 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.898 position:27% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Damn it!

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Huh?

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.137 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, shit!

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.339 position:30% line:89% align:start
[kissing sound]

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:54.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
But in case something
like this might happen,

00:12:54.643 --> 00:12:56.977 position:30% line:83% align:start
I put a sticker
on there. [grunts]

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:03.017 position:35% line:89% align:start

[disappointed exhale]

00:13:13.628 --> 00:13:15.697 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm merely a spectator here.

[exhales nervously]

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:19.199 position:21% line:83% align:start
I won't move a muscle

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:22.336 position:16% line:83% align:start
But still, though I can't
prove what she just did...

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:28.175 position:13% line:83% align:start
On the inside, Ermes knows
exactly what happened.

00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:31.211 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's no denying it.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your bestie just broke
one of the rules.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.883 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know because...

00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:39.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
The debt collector,
Mary Lynn Manson

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:40.722 position:19% line:89% align:start
has appeared before us.

you hide it away

00:13:56.337 --> 00:13:57.572 position:21% line:89% align:start
or what the item is,

00:13:57.605 --> 00:13:59.574 position:7% line:89% align:start
it takes absolutely everything

00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:01.275 position:13% line:89% align:start
and leaves nothing behind.

Ermes!

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:30.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you sold this liver
I'm holding

00:14:30.572 --> 00:14:31.238 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the black market...

[dings]

00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:36.243 position:13% line:83% align:start

Piss off! [yells]

00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:42.182 position:24% line:89% align:start
[speechless grunt]

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:45.486 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am the shadow that lies
deep within Ermes's heart.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.389 position:7% line:83% align:start
The two of you cannot possibly
land an attack on me.

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ermes has broken
the rules you established,

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:53.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
and has therefore lost
the bet on her own.

00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:56.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
I came to collect the debt
weighing on her shoulders.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or are there any other
precious items she may have?

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.134 position:21% line:83% align:start
If so, I can exchange
this liver

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.436 position:10% line:89% align:start
for something of equal value.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:04.606 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] This bet
still isn't over yet.

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:06.173 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:08.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'll catch the ball
a thousand times,

00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:09.544 position:24% line:89% align:start
and if we succeed,

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:12.279 position:13% line:83% align:start
you'll give back everything
you took from her.

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:14.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
And then just leave us
the hell alone.

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.382 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:18.051 position:7% line:83% align:start
However, I'm sure you're aware
of how this goes.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.354 position:13% line:83% align:start
You must offer up something
of equal value.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.992 position:7% line:83% align:start
Excellent. With the rules set,
the game has begun.

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:26.460 position:30% line:89% align:start
See you later.

00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:28.696 position:35% line:89% align:start
F.F., here!

J--Jolyne...

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.936 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ermes, you're not the one
at fault here.

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:39.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
Since Miraschon is
a Stand User,

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's a high chance
that Pale Snake is involved.

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:42.844 position:24% line:89% align:start
If that's the case,

00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:45.245 position:24% line:83% align:start
then they're aiming
for my dad's disc!

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.481 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's what
the collector is for.

There you go.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.753 position:24% line:83% align:start
Another reason not
to take this bet. [grunts]

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:53.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
You got dragged into
this shit-fest

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.289 position:13% line:89% align:start
because of my family drama.

But how the hell are we going
to pull this off?

00:15:59.627 --> 00:16:01.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're talking about
a thousand throws in a row!

00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:04.164 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that thing earlier
was basically invincible!

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:08.001 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's exactly why we're
gonna chase down Miraschon

00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:09.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
and attack her directly!

[both gasp]

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:13.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
That greedy Stand of hers
may be invincible,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.441 position:13% line:89% align:start
but her body is fair game!

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why she's putting
distance between us!

00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:20.782 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

[Jolyne] You see her?

00:16:30.224 --> 00:16:32.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I saw her come
in here.

That door on the other side
of the room.

00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:35.395 position:10% line:89% align:start
She must've left from there.
