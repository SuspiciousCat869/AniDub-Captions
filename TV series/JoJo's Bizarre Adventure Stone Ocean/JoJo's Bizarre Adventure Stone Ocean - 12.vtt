00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.375 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Who is that?

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.276 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
This girl is Jolyne Cujoh,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
but where in God's name
is Lang Rangler?

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
Am I be right to assume
that he failed his objective

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:18.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
and she still has the disc
in her possession?

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:20.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
If so, within a few moments,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
she will meet someone
at the courtyard

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.825 position:21% line:83% align:start
and hand the disc off
to them.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:25.325 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know that guy.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
He serves as a priest
at the prison's chapel.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.330 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is he doing here?

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Pucchi] Did she find out?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.202 position:13% line:83% align:start
No, if she had any inkling
that I was her enemy,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
we would be in the midst
of battle right now.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:39.974 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hold on! F-- Father, wait!

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:41.408 position:33% line:89% align:start
I beg of you.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
Whatever you do,
please don't sound that alarm.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.947 position:13% line:83% align:start
The last thing that I want
is to cause trouble

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.314 position:13% line:89% align:start
or make some kind of scene!

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:48.883 position:33% line:89% align:start
What do I do?

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.084 position:16% line:83% align:start
Should I take the chance
and knock him out?

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.119 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sure, I could.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
If it's to bring
my old man back to life.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.290 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hitting a priest is nothing.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.259 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aren't you ignoring

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.295 position:27% line:83% align:start
the real problem
happening here?

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.998 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've taken someone else's
work permit card and used it

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get me to open the door.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.335 position:13% line:83% align:start
Pray tell, what has become
of the prisoner

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.404 position:7% line:89% align:start
this card actually belongs to?

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.506 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lang Rangler?

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:13.708 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know you just met me,

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.310 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I won't ask you
to believe what I'm saying,

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:18.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I have no reason
to lie to you, Father.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was assaulted by the prisoner
you're referring to,

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.017 position:21% line:89% align:start
so I defended myself.

00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:24.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's in that hamper,

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
probably dreaming about how
I knocked him out cold.

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:28.455 position:16% line:89% align:start
Regardless of the reason,

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
I am obligated to report
this matter to the authorities.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sure, do what you have to.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, it has to be
after I get to the courtyard.

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.165 position:21% line:89% align:start
Give me two minutes.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.835 position:13% line:83% align:start
No, all I need is a single
solitary minute, Father.

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.003 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let me go to the courtyard,

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.072 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you can turn me in.
That's all I ask.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.607 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense grunt]

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] Are you asking me
to overlook your wrongdoings?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Someone's life
is on the line.

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.982 position:10% line:89% align:start
My own dad's life and spirit.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:57.217 position:10% line:83% align:start
Surely a priest like yourself
can understand my situation.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you by your lonesome?

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or is there anyone else
in here with you?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.526 position:7% line:89% align:start
[exhales] Nu-uh. It's only me.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.195 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
I just lied to a priest.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
But a tiny lie like that
can be forgiven.

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:11.899 position:16% line:89% align:start
And mentioning the discs

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
would send up
immediate red flags.

00:02:13.935 --> 00:02:15.737 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, Father.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
One minute is all I ask.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.407 position:13% line:83% align:start
In most cases, when someone
does something for others,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
they expect to receive
some sort of reward in return.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.580 position:21% line:89% align:start
To be kind to others

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:27.314 position:33% line:83% align:start
is to expect
that same kindness

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.650 position:13% line:89% align:start
from those you give it to.

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
And that cannot be
called unconditional love.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.487 position:16% line:83% align:start
True unconditional love,
my dear,

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:37.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
is the reward of eventually
reaching the gates of heaven.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.259 position:35% line:89% align:start
You may go.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.663 position:10% line:83% align:start
I will pretend that our paths
never crossed here.

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:43.330 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-[gasps]

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.266 position:21% line:83% align:start
But per your request,
you only have one minute.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.235 position:16% line:83% align:start
I trust you'll return to
this gate by then

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.771 position:16% line:89% align:start
and not a second longer.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:50.705 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.810 position:21% line:89% align:start
I had to let her go.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
Despite her lie,
I know someone is hiding there.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.782 position:27% line:83% align:start
If she does have
comrades around,

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.918 position:19% line:83% align:start
I cannot risk revealing
that I am Pale Snake's user,

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
even if it is to
dispose of Jolyne.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.600 position:33% line:83% align:start
According to
the Speedwagon Foundation,

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:21.201 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll know how to
hand over the disc

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.236 position:33% line:83% align:start
once I arrive
at the courtyard.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.740 position:41% line:83% align:start
I guess
this is what they meant.

00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:30.545 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, you.

00:03:30.578 --> 00:03:33.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you have a pass that
permits you to be out here?

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:35.850 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.220 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:43.157 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna say that's a "no",

00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
so that must mean
you're trying to escape.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.261 position:44% line:83% align:start
What?
What the hell happened?!

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:51.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sounding the alarm
was never part of my plan.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:53.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm glad I thought ahead.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.235 position:21% line:83% align:start
Having a guard patrol
the courtyard

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:56.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
was the perfect decision.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.238 position:35% line:89% align:start
[clatters]

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
[opening theme song playing]

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:50.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] In the year 1988,
my life took a turn.

00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.887 position:19% line:83% align:start
I met a man from Egypt
who possessed the ability

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.522 position:21% line:89% align:start
to stop time itself,

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
and we developed
a rather close relationship.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.128 position:33% line:83% align:start
One evening,
he suddenly told me this.

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:03.898 position:27% line:83% align:start
If someone wished
to go to heaven,

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:05.032 position:24% line:89% align:start
there may be a way.

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:08.202 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] He was young
and unbelievably beautiful,

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
but with an aura about him
that suggested

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.073 position:33% line:83% align:start
he had lived
for hundreds of years.

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.674 position:19% line:89% align:start
At that time, I was 16

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:16.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
and a student aspiring
to go to a seminary.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:20.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't look at me
that way.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm just talking about
the human mind.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.819 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not like I'm telling you
to wither and die.

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:27.088 position:35% line:83% align:start
This Heaven
pertains to our spirits

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.756 position:38% line:83% align:start
and where
they go after death.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
As your spirit evolves,
so too does your power.

00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:34.795 position:10% line:83% align:start
Where they ultimately end up
is what fascinates me.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
Surely, you of all people

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:39.399 position:30% line:83% align:start
understand what
I'm talking about.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's there that one
will find true happiness.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.273 position:10% line:83% align:start
That is, if they can make it
into Heaven, of course.

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:46.807 position:27% line:89% align:start
Though I'm aware,

00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:49.744 position:24% line:83% align:start
joy cannot be found
by having an invincible body,

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:54.181 position:10% line:83% align:start
Vast riches, or even reigning
over all humanity.

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
In the end, the true winner

00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
is the one who gets
to witness Heaven.

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.023 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I will
get there some day,

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:03.658 position:13% line:89% align:start
no matter what it costs me.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.028 position:21% line:83% align:start
And how are you going
to achieve that, exactly?

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:10.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah, well, I wrote the process
in a notebook.

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:13.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
One day, find me in Egypt.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.469 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll show it to you there.

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:19.307 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I ever hope
to figure this out,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.876 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will need you to assist me.

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:23.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] However,
before I could learn

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:25.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
the means of attaining Heaven,

The notebook he spoke of
was burned to ash...

by none other than
Jolyne Cujoh's father,

00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:37.892 position:33% line:89% align:start
Jotaro Kujo.

00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jotaro laid eyes on
the contents

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.462 position:16% line:89% align:start
of the notebook that day.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:43.664 position:19% line:89% align:start
And with the book gone,

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:45.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
the information
was sealed with him forever.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
Along with the man
who aimed for heaven,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.205 position:24% line:89% align:start
Dio Brando himself.

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:55.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the next 20 years,
I waited patiently

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.479 position:33% line:83% align:start
for my chance
to obtain Jotaro's memories,

00:07:59.513 --> 00:08:01.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
so that I could relive
the moment

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:02.917 position:13% line:89% align:start
that he read the notebook.

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:07.254 position:13% line:83% align:start
And finally, after decades,
I got it.

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:08.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
His memories were mine.

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:11.826 position:21% line:83% align:start
Along with the Stand
that surpassed even Dio,

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.127 position:30% line:89% align:start
Star Platinum.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.264 position:10% line:83% align:start
I ensured that Jotaro's body
would wither and decay.

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
And although
his troublesome daughter

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.769 position:30% line:83% align:start
behaved in ways
I never could have expected,

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.238 position:13% line:89% align:start
it's all taken care of now.

[Jolyne groaning]

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.845 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? She got shot.

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:34.849 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jolyne got shot.
But by who? A guard?

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.517 position:33% line:83% align:start
Or maybe that
bastard Pale Snake

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.119 position:27% line:83% align:start
figured out where
she was going to deliver

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:40.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
the disc and he's hiding
around here somewhere.

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.993 position:41% line:89% align:start

[crashes]

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
The guard I control
will take care

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:52.633 position:10% line:89% align:start
of retrieving Star Platinum,

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:55.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
so there's no reason
for me to stay here anymore.

00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:56.971 position:16% line:89% align:start
With that out of the way,

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.040 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should head back
to the chapel.

out here again?

00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:05.646 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh right, the disc.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.815 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was given orders to bring

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:10.084 position:30% line:83% align:start
this thing back
without a scratch on it.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:13.254 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I was also ordered
to make sure Jolyne Cujoh

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:14.855 position:16% line:89% align:start
is finished off for good.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:18.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thing is, I don't know
who gave me these orders.

Doesn't matter.

00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:31.305 position:35% line:83% align:start
Either way,
I was given orders

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:33.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
to completely blast
straight through

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.276 position:10% line:89% align:start
Jolyne's head with this gun.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:36.944 position:33% line:89% align:start
Damn it all.

00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:40.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's nothing I can do
to help you now.

00:09:40.448 --> 00:09:42.283 position:27% line:83% align:start
In your greatest
moment of need,

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:44.185 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm utterly useless!

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.254 position:10% line:89% align:start

is a power to control

this is all I can offer.

Jolyne...

I wasn't able to save you,

00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:22.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I might be able
to protect the disc.

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:24.024 position:38% line:89% align:start

you still have the strength

in the state
of Florida alone,

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:44.311 position:30% line:83% align:start
there were more
than 50 reported cases

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:47.047 position:19% line:83% align:start
of fish, frogs, snakes

falling from the sky
in unbelievable numbers.

00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:54.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was caused by a tornado.
At least that's what they say.

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:57.191 position:10% line:83% align:start
And these colorful amphibians
are poison dart frogs

00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:00.161 position:19% line:83% align:start
that live on tree tops
in Central and South America.

Judging by the color

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
they are most certainly
poison dart frogs.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:28.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
It takes less than
a few seconds

00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:30.424 position:21% line:83% align:start

Stay calm
and listen to my voice!

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:58.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
I need your card key!

Will I be saved
if I give this to you?

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:07.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey! Don't take it out
while you're over there!

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:07.716 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:25.999 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, what a relief!

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:28.268 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, sir, I need you
to open this gate immediately!

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.270 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, why are you here,
Father?

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:31.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:33.575 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have no idea!
A tornado, maybe!

00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:35.376 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now please, just hurry!

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:36.343 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:38.546 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right away. Uh...

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.716 position:19% line:89% align:start
T-- These frogs are...

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
What are you standing
there for?

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.486 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have another guard
in here who's already fallen!

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.954 position:13% line:89% align:start
You have to open the gate!

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:48.222 position:19% line:89% align:start
You don't mean he's...

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:51.091 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh... for now,
try to remain calm, Father.

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:53.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go find someone
who can help right away!

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:56.029 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hold on! Where do
you think you're going?

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is hit
the switch over here

00:14:58.165 --> 00:14:59.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
and the gate will open!

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:01.669 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes, I understand that, sir,

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.270 position:10% line:89% align:start
but there may be a liability,

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:05.540 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I need to check
with my supervisor.

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:07.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
So please, just calm down.

00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:08.810 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be back soon!

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:10.944 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ah, but I am perfectly calm.

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:15.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only one who isn't
calm here... 73, 79... is you.

00:15:16.651 --> 00:15:18.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you going to
abandon me?

00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:20.921 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll be back right away,
Father!

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.923 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, Pale Snake,

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:25.159 position:7% line:83% align:start
take a disc from my collection
and hand it to me!

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:30.097 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't control all of them,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.933 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I can choose one
to enact my will!

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:37.639 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:49.049 position:35% line:89% align:start
H--Help me!

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:51.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please call somebody,
Father...!

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.688 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need medical attention!

00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.790 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:57.692 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Father!
-Ninety-seven.

00:15:57.725 --> 00:15:59.993 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you want me,
I'm right here.

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:02.196 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just open the door.

00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
You must know if I am able
to leave here

00:16:03.932 --> 00:16:04.933 position:24% line:89% align:start
and call for help,

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
you can get treatment
right away.

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:09.771 position:7% line:83% align:start
That is what you are thinking,
is it not?

00:16:09.804 --> 00:16:11.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
If so, why would
you not make it

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:14.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
a priority to move
in the direction of my voice?

-[door buzzing]

00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:20.113 position:41% line:89% align:start
Father!

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:27.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
The disc that contains
Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum.

00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.456 position:16% line:83% align:start
Exactly what should I do
about it now?

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.424 position:19% line:89% align:start
I took care of Jolyne,

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.292 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I can't just leave her
in the courtyard.

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did... did the gate
finally open?

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please take me with you.
Father?

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.836 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hello? Father, where are you?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[thuds]
-This is my limit.

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:46.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't hold back
the poison anymore!

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:48.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I dropped the disc.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.912 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't even know
where it is!

The rain has stopped.

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:11.900 position:33% line:89% align:start
But where...

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:15.102 position:27% line:83% align:start
is Jolyne Cujoh's
lifeless body?

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:17.505 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I find her,
I should find the disc.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.307 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] I was frightened
there for a moment,

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there's no way frogs
can defeat a snake.

00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:26.179 position:30% line:89% align:start
Search for it.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:29.517 position:7% line:83% align:start
Pale Snake's range of movement
is barely 20 meters at best.

00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:32.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm running a huge risk
by even being here.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.454 position:24% line:83% align:start
If someone sees me,
all bets are off.

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:36.891 position:13% line:89% align:start
But there is no other way.

00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:37.825 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:46.266 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have heard that
in the east

00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:52.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
there are stories of
a similar nature,

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:54.107 position:16% line:89% align:start
but this horror is truly

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:55.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
the personification
of that proverb.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.847 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nonetheless, the disc I seek
must be around here somewhere.

00:18:00.648 --> 00:18:02.316 position:24% line:89% align:start
Listen, Pale Snake,

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want you to sweep the area
between where you are

00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:06.554 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the entrance to the gate.

00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:08.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
The guard may have
taken it earlier.

00:18:08.923 --> 00:18:10.457 position:30% line:83% align:start
It should be in
that direction.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:12.459 position:35% line:89% align:start

[Jolyne] Thanks a lot.

God damn it!

00:18:36.017 --> 00:18:39.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is so gross.
They're all over my face.

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:40.855 position:16% line:89% align:start
Makes me wanna throw up.

00:18:41.723 --> 00:18:43.057 position:16% line:89% align:start
The poison only comes out

00:18:43.091 --> 00:18:45.325 position:19% line:83% align:start
when the frogs splatter
on impact,

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:47.629 position:16% line:83% align:start
so if they don't explode,
they're harmless.

00:18:47.662 --> 00:18:50.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I made a net
using live frogs,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
in order to lessen the impact
of the frogs still falling.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:57.839 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which allowed me to lay in wait

I won.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:59.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't underestimate me,
you insolent brat!

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.536 position:21% line:89% align:start
This changes nothing!

00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:03.037 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even with Star Platinum
returned,

00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:04.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
your father will be
nothing more

00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.606 position:21% line:89% align:start
than a broken puppet!

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.340 position:21% line:83% align:start
He will never be able
to recognize you

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.943 position:13% line:89% align:start
as his own daughter again!

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:10.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
This little game is over!

00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:11.713 position:24% line:89% align:start
[guard1 ] Hey look!

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:13.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's a guard
knocked out over there!

[guard 2]
Don't step on the frogs!

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:17.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
And check the courtyard!
There might be someone else!

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:24.125 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, not yet.
I can't faint here.

00:20:24.158 --> 00:20:27.461 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Stand User
has to be nearby somewhere.

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:30.598 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have to find out
who Pale Snake really is,

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.568 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the User still has
my father's memory disc!

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:36.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now's the best chance
I'm gonna get

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:37.739 position:16% line:89% align:start
to discover who they are!

00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:42.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
[inmate 1] Hey!
Look outside the window!

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.045 position:21% line:83% align:start
[inmate 2] Oh my god!
Unbelievable!

00:20:44.078 --> 00:20:44.779 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a bloody miracle!

00:20:45.847 --> 00:20:48.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
[inmate 1] But who's gonna
clean up this mess?

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:50.450 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi]
Nothing has changed at all.

00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.019 position:19% line:89% align:start
The only reason I stole

00:20:52.053 --> 00:20:53.286 position:27% line:83% align:start
Star Platinum in
the first place

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.123 position:16% line:89% align:start
was to defeat Jotaro Kujo

00:20:55.156 --> 00:20:58.192 position:21% line:83% align:start
and avenge the death
of my best friend.

00:20:58.226 --> 00:21:00.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
What matters most
is the memory disc,

00:21:00.327 --> 00:21:02.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
and it still remains
in my possession.

00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:05.233 position:7% line:89% align:start
Everything is going as planned.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
The instructions on
how to reach heaven

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
can only be found in
Jotaro's memory.

[grunts, exhales]

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.448 position:10% line:89% align:start
[man] An abnormal occurrence

00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
where frogs rained down
from the sky solely

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the prison courtyard.

00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:30.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
Through the chaos
of this unexplainable event,

00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:33.326 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jolyne's attempt at escaping
went unquestioned.

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:38.232 position:33% line:83% align:start
And thanks to
a feathered friend,

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:40.535 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Speedwagon Foundation
obtained the disc

00:21:40.568 --> 00:21:43.704 position:30% line:83% align:start
which contains
Jotaro Kujo's Star Platinum.

00:21:43.738 --> 00:21:45.973 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
without the memory disc,

00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:49.744 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jotaro's mind and soul
will never be restored.

This is the bone
that I want to ask you about.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:31.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
Using your unique abilities,

00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:33.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
there is something
I would like to try.

00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.149 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:23:35.182 --> 00:23:36.918 position:10% line:89% align:start
Does that belong to a human?

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:38.451 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whose bone is it?

00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:40.388 position:35% line:83% align:start
That answer
is none of your business.

00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:42.990 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's just say it belongs
to an old friend of mine.

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.260 position:13% line:89% align:start
The bone of my dear friend,

00:23:46.294 --> 00:23:47.929 position:30% line:89% align:start
the great Dio.
