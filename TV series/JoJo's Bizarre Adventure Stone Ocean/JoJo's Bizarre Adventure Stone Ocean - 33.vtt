[Jolyne] Hey, Ermes.
He's there.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.778 position:30% line:83% align:start
Call a doctor.
He should've healed...

-from the snails by now.

I'm sorry,
the wind has stopped.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.356 position:10% line:83% align:start
The rainbow disappeared too.
See, Jolyne?

One more time...

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:46.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanna speak with you,
just one more time.

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.716 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sniffles]

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.019 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just once more...
[sniffles]

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanna talk to you
in the soft breeze.

[Jolyne] Weather Forecast...

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
You never gave up.
In your final moments,

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:32.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
you were trying to tell me
to pursue the priest.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
You even took advantage
of Pale Snake's ability

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
to upload your stand,
Weather Forecast,

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:38.265 position:16% line:89% align:start
onto a disc of its own.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.337 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I were to stick this disc
inside of my head,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.773 position:27% line:83% align:start
would I be able
to use your abilities too?

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.309 position:21% line:83% align:start
Although, the priest
has already started

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
making his way toward
Cape Canaveral.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.716 position:24% line:83% align:start
Only two more days
until the new moon.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.018 position:30% line:89% align:start
At this point,

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know if
I can even take control

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:00.454 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the situation anymore.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm so lost. What do I do?

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:08.495 position:10% line:83% align:start
Despite the snail apocalypse
we just dealt with,

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
Dad's disc was given
to the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.268 position:19% line:83% align:start
My old man will regain
consciousness again,

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.105 position:30% line:83% align:start
and he'll know
what needs to be done.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.006 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ECG beeps]

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.273 position:7% line:89% align:start
Should I wait for him or not?

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.044 position:7% line:89% align:start
But while I'm waiting for him,

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.378 position:10% line:89% align:start
the priest might perpetrate

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
an evil act again
in Cape Canaveral.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.451 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, Dad. What should I do?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
[sighs]
Please, Dad. Tell me.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I had never gotten inside
of that car,

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.261 position:21% line:83% align:start
Weather might still
be alive right now.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.599 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, I must go

00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:46.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
to Cape Canaveral.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:48.503 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to take care
of the priest!

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.339 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please, Dad, give me a sign.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just what is it
that I can do at this point?

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.611 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is it?

[mellow piano music]

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.053 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's so... She's so cute.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:47.387 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:50.490 position:21% line:89% align:start
How is she so cute?

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.261 position:7% line:89% align:start
And she's even cuter sleeping

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
on my shoulder like that.
Jolyne...

00:04:57.265 --> 00:04:58.666 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.935 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm finally
around Jolyne again.

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:03.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
I made a promise to myself
that, when I got out of prison

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:05.273 position:19% line:83% align:start
and finally caught up
to Jolyne,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I'd tell her
how I feel about her.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:09.376 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't have
any more time to waste.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I don't tell her now,
I won't get another chance.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.715 position:10% line:83% align:start
Fact is, my feelings for her
are genuine.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.384 position:35% line:83% align:start
After all,
I paid a whole fortune

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.886 position:27% line:83% align:start
to get my hands
on this ring

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
while I was in prison.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:21.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
When she wakes
from her slumber,

00:05:22.924 --> 00:05:24.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
all I'll ask from her is

00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:27.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
to know and embrace
how I truly feel.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.363 position:30% line:83% align:start

They think
they're so goddamn safe

00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:39.006 position:30% line:83% align:start
'cause they're
federally protected,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.008 position:16% line:83% align:start

out of us back in prison.

Hold on! Are you serious?

open up your hands

[Emporio] This is where we are,
Cape Canaveral.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.159 position:30% line:83% align:start
At coordinates
28 degrees 24 minutes North,

00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:07.261 position:5% line:89% align:start
and 80 degrees 36 minutes West,

00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:08.428 position:10% line:89% align:start
it's the section of Florida

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
that juts out
onto the Atlantic.

00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:14.068 position:16% line:83% align:start

of 34,000 hectares,

where wildlife and
ancient nature still remain.

00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:18.005 position:38% line:89% align:start
A shoal?

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a part of land which is

00:07:19.407 --> 00:07:22.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
the accumulation of sediment
from a river.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
And this place is where
we're currently headed to...

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:27.381 position:24% line:89% align:start
The Space Center.

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.449 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are no trains or buses
leading to it,

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
and you can only get there
by driving a car.

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:33.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
With their devotion
to space travel,

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.256 position:30% line:83% align:start
they focus on
launching rockets,

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.292 position:7% line:83% align:start
satellites, and space shuttles
into the great unknown.

00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:40.962 position:10% line:83% align:start
This structure right here is
the vehicle assembly building.

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:43.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that's the launching
complex and observation gantry.

00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.633 position:35% line:83% align:start
Being more
than five kilometers apart

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:47.635 position:10% line:89% align:start

must enter this way

00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.442 position:16% line:83% align:start
before they can explore
the rest of the complex.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
There, the visitors will
purchase tickets,

00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:58.379 position:10% line:89% align:start
go through security checks,

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.681 position:5% line:83% align:start

00:08:04.452 --> 00:08:06.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's most likely
that the priest

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.323 position:10% line:83% align:start
made his way into the Center
by taking this route as well.

Though I still have no idea
what his true agenda here is,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.894 position:7% line:89% align:start
he's probably going to lay low

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.663 position:27% line:83% align:start
somewhere inside
the Space Center

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:17.565 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:08:45.226 --> 00:08:49.263 position:10% line:83% align:start

Or could you be a priest?

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.599 position:33% line:83% align:start
I try to do
one good deed a day.

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:54.035 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's sort of like a personal
goal I've set for myself.

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:55.236 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you sightseeing?

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.404 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know, it's just...

00:08:56.437 --> 00:08:58.372 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm curious
why a man of God like you

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:00.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
is interested
in all this space stuff.

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:02.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because if you ask me,
you look a little out of place.

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.179 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, actually,
it kind of makes sense, right?

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
God and space
are sort of similar, you know?

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:10.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
And who can say,
maybe God is actually an alien?

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:12.586 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh, that's just a little joke.
Did I offend?

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.321 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:15.990 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you expecting me to humor

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
these ridiculous questions
with an answer?

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.326 position:44% line:89% align:start
Eh?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.995 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucci] You did your
good deed for the day.

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:22.496 position:24% line:89% align:start
Isn't that enough?

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
If this is your idea of killing
time, go do it somewhere else.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like I was
in such a hurry

00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:29.036 position:10% line:89% align:start
that I could not have waited

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:39.548 position:5% line:89% align:start
[voice-over] The trickiest part

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
of launching a spacecraft\
into outer space

00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:44.085 position:10% line:83% align:start
is the unpredictable problem
of gravity.

00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:46.854 position:16% line:83% align:start
When launching a rocket,
even the slightest variation

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
in gravitational pull
can make a difference.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.826 position:33% line:83% align:start
That is why,
when building a launchpad,

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:53.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
it is most effective
to construct it

00:09:53.828 --> 00:09:55.830 position:13% line:83% align:start
near the earth's equator.
-[monitor beeps]

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:58.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because of the centrifugal
force of the Earth's rotation,

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
the gravitational pull
at the equator

00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.636 position:10% line:89% align:start
is weaker than at the poles.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.138 position:33% line:83% align:start
[voice-over]
Perhaps Olympic high-divers

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.273 position:16% line:83% align:start
might be able to achieve
a better record

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:07.808 position:7% line:89% align:start
when they're near the equator.

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:12.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
Something's off. I feel odd.

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:14.549 position:10% line:83% align:start
[voice-over] On top of that,
here in Cape Canaveral,

00:10:14.583 --> 00:10:17.218 position:19% line:83% align:start
the sea level offshore
is quite distinct.

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.821 position:7% line:83% align:start
Typically, sea level is marked
zero meters above sea level.

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:24.058 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, scientific studies
in recent years have shown

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:26.861 position:27% line:83% align:start
that sea levels
often vary by location.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:29.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's take the Maldives of
the Indian Ocean for example.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.466 position:21% line:83% align:start
Research shows that
sea level offshore

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.702 position:19% line:83% align:start
is close to 100 meters
below sea level.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
On the other hand,

00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:39.440 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's about 30 meters above
sea level near the Sea of Japan.

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:41.375 position:30% line:83% align:start
And offshore,
here in Cape Canaveral,

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's about 50 meters
above sea level.

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:47.047 position:7% line:83% align:start
In other words, gravity isn't
the same everywhere on Earth,

00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:48.983 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it can be said
that gravity is weak,

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:51.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
-here in Cape Canaveral.
-[wheezing]

00:10:51.252 --> 00:10:53.754 position:5% line:83% align:start
[voice-over] Also, depending on
the current phase of the moon,

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:57.224 position:13% line:83% align:start
sea level can rise as high
as 100 meters above sea level.

[gurgling]

[voice-over]
It is for this reason

00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:00.995 position:19% line:89% align:start
that Cape Canaveral is

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:02.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
one of the most
optimal locations on Earth

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.232 position:7% line:89% align:start

You're filled with
an intense determination

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.591 position:21% line:89% align:start
to kill the priest,

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
and yet, it seems that
you still yearn

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:47.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
for your father
to come save you.

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:50.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
But what you don't see
is that I can protect you

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:53.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
better than Weather
or Jotaro ever could.

where on Earth am I headed now?

[Emporio] I have no idea.

I guess it could be that it got
broken in the wreck somehow.

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:14.281 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or maybe it has something to do
with the strange gravity.

I don't know.

that a rescue team will
possibly show up?
