[guard]
Greetings, everyone.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.911 position:38% line:83% align:start
I am your
cheerful chief here

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:51.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
at Green Dolphin Street
State Prison.

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:53.815 position:13% line:89% align:start
You may call me Locobaroco.

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:55.049 position:38% line:89% align:start
And also,

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:56.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
this special girl
I have with me here

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:59.721 position:24% line:83% align:start
is my one and only
trusted assistant, Charlotte.

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:00.655 position:16% line:89% align:start
[in higher voice] Hello.

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:05.026 position:10% line:83% align:start
Charlotte, dear, if you would
please give our prisoners

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.095 position:24% line:83% align:start
a brief rundown of
what their lives will

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.261 position:35% line:83% align:start
be like for
the foreseeable future.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.196 position:21% line:89% align:start
[as Charlotte] Sure!

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.164 position:10% line:89% align:start
Here in this prison facility,

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.101 position:33% line:83% align:start
we represent
the ideas of our country,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.536 position:10% line:89% align:start
placing emphasis on equality.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.338 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you wish to wander around
or partake in exercise,

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
you are free to do so
in a designated area.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.945 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can use the phones,
take a shower, or read books.

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:27.447 position:16% line:83% align:start
An exemplary prisoner can
even have a TV in their cell.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.884 position:13% line:83% align:start
Some may be allowed to work
and are given a chance

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:31.351 position:38% line:83% align:start
to study
for a college degree.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.420 position:30% line:83% align:start
You heard her,
and that's not all.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:36.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, yes, Charlotte.
Do you have a question?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.424 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just remembered.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.827 position:16% line:83% align:start
There are rules that must
be followed too, aren't there?

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why of course, Charlotte.
You're absolutely right.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.765 position:7% line:89% align:start
First, under no circumstances,

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fare you allowed to
take off the wristband

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
with your designated
prisoner number.

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
Second, there will
be no borrowing

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
or lending things
among inmates.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.908 position:19% line:83% align:start
And any metal materials
are prohibited.

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is wearing earrings
still okay?

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.778 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shut your mouth
right this instant!

00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:58.112 position:19% line:89% align:start
The chief is speaking!

00:02:58.146 --> 00:02:59.446 position:24% line:89% align:start
[nervously exhales]

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, they're not allowed,
inmate FE40536, Jolyne Cujoh.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.087 position:35% line:83% align:start
If you have
any further inquiries,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
please ask the guards,
and they can assist you.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.891 position:16% line:89% align:start
Orientation is complete.

00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:13.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
All right! Everyone, turn
and face to your left!

00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:16.229 position:7% line:89% align:start
[inmate 1] This place is huge.

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:18.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
I hear the prison
covers this whole island.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
[inmate 2] Oh, alligator.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
Welcome to your new home,
cell number 206.

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
Break time for today
has come and gone.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:47.095 position:13% line:89% align:start
The cell opens at 6:30 a.m.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:49.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
Breakfast begins at seven a.m.,

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.766 position:30% line:83% align:start
but if you wish
to sleep in you're allowed.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:55.235 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Hope you two can get along.
-[door buzzing]

00:03:58.206 --> 00:03:59.574 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:01.776 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.243 position:24% line:89% align:start
The name's Jolyne.

-My name is Gwess. Want some?
-Thank you.

But so much stuff
happened today

an appetite.

What's your prob--

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:17.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know you're new here,
but the bottom bunk is mine!

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.060 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you gonna have
a problem with that,

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:20.728 position:16% line:89% align:start
you stupid little whore?

Look, I'm not interested
in fighting you.

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
I saw your stuff
on the top bed,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.775 position:13% line:89% align:start
so I thought it was yours.

[scoffs]

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.045 position:16% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Why is that here?

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:40.081 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is wrong with you?

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now you're trying
to jack my stuff too?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, I just want to
see that closer.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:44.919 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please listen to me.

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you open that charm,
you'll find a small stone

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:49.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
and a picture of
my parents inside.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.626 position:38% line:83% align:start
It may be
the one I threw away.

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.128 position:35% line:83% align:start
Is that so?
I bought this for two bucks

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:55.663 position:27% line:83% align:start
from a new inmate
the other day.

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:57.397 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's pretty, wouldn't you say?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, sure. Just let me see!

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Get your hands off me,
you filthy bitch!

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:02.236 position:7% line:89% align:start
No way I'm letting you see it.

[grumbles]

Fine, I'll buy it off of you.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.708 position:13% line:89% align:start
Go ahead. Name your price.

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:10.511 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Two hundred bucks.
-What the hell?!

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:13.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
Didn't you hear me, dumbass?
I said two hundred.

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:14.982 position:27% line:89% align:start
You... you bitch.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.573 position:41% line:83% align:start
So many
strange things happened.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
My mind is racing
with thoughts.

About last night.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:06.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I'm really sorry.
-Huh?

[Jolyne] Morning?

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.539 position:38% line:89% align:start

-Huh?
-Don't worry.

It's fine if you look.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.345 position:38% line:89% align:start
Although,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
that pic of your parents
wasn't in there.

00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:20.348 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry, but I don't think

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.782 position:27% line:83% align:start
this is the charm
you're looking for.

See?

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.154 position:13% line:89% align:start
Was anything inside at all?

Sorry, there wasn't.

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:33.060 position:19% line:83% align:start

You see, I'm a coward.

Shouldn't you have food
prepared for everyone?

You've gotta at least
have a banana left.

Oh, Jolyne, guess
you decided to sleep in.

I'm so full.

Gwess, hold on.

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.803 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did I just see two milks
and two bananas on your tray?

00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:49.737 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.206 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would I have two?
That'd be selfish.

Oh, by the way,

Don't worry,
I'll clean it all up later.

Wow, that's so nice of you!

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
Fly over here
and take a look.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.502 position:19% line:83% align:start
I believe you can do it
with all my heart.

00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:23.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can do anything
with the power of love.

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.439 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, as long as
we trust each other,

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:27.074 position:21% line:89% align:start
anything is possible.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:29.610 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now give it a try.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:36.650 position:30% line:83% align:start

Oh, yes! Good boy!

You're so freaking adorable.

00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:40.254 position:21% line:83% align:start

it off for me.

Copy-chan, that was great!

Here, have a treat, darling.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:45.159 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning!

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, we've talked about this.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.232 position:16% line:83% align:start
You don't greet me with,
"Good morning."

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:52.466 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's, "Love you."
Remember?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.768 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now, let's try again.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's much cuter when you say
you love me, you know?

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.072 position:27% line:89% align:start
I... I love you!

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.509 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes! Good, good, good!

That's my perfect little man,
Copy-chan!

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.346 position:21% line:89% align:start

-Try flying to my finger.
-Uh...

To build trust between us,

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:11.786 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have to take risks
here and there.

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:13.054 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:15.756 position:19% line:83% align:start

Just get on with it!

What? "Whoa"?

What did you just say?

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:26.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do little birdies say, "Whoa"

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.636 position:30% line:89% align:start
I... love you!

Hey now, don't you start
messing with me.

00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:33.941 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do you got some
superficial idea

00:09:33.974 --> 00:09:35.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
about what love and trust
should be?

There's a tiny person inside,

The only explanation for this

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.850 position:21% line:83% align:start
is she has that stone
from the amulet,

At the far end
of this corridor,

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
you're going to find
a control center.

00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:50.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your objective is to get
to that switch over there.

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:53.702 position:13% line:83% align:start
It can unlock all the cells

But it's important

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.817 position:35% line:83% align:start

For this mission,

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.787 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:40.909 position:10% line:89% align:start
leads to the control center.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
And there are cameras

Is it because Gwess left?

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:28.136 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wasn't expecting you
to also have an ability.

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.236 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come here!

00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:31.139 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, wait a second!

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, Jolyne, I'm begging you.

00:19:32.507 --> 00:19:34.842 position:30% line:83% align:start
Stop strangling
my Cry Cry Dolls so tightly!

Hey, I don't wanna hear it!

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
Focus on shrinking
my body enough

00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:39.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I can squeeze out of here.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.682 position:7% line:89% align:start
But only just a little, got it?

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:43.885 position:10% line:83% align:start
Okay, okay. You can even have
the bottom bunk too.

00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:45.153 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know we've been
through a lot,

but please don't hate me.

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:49.023 position:13% line:83% align:start
Still though, I'd like you
to speak to me

all cutesy
from time to time.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.926 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just hurry and do it already!

[grunts, exhales]

00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:56.363 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh... all right.

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:58.066 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now hand over the amulet.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:59.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
That includes
the stone inside,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.936 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I wanna know
who you bought it from too.

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:03.470 position:10% line:89% align:start
Of course, whatever you say.

00:20:03.504 --> 00:20:05.139 position:35% line:83% align:start
That'll be
two hundred dollars.

00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:06.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
Shut the fuck up, you bitch!

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just tell me the name
before I kill you!

00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:09.944 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, I got it.

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.411 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, uh... I'm not sure,

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.581 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I think her name
was Ermes?

00:20:13.614 --> 00:20:14.448 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ermes?

00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:16.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Gwess] I don't know her
that well.

00:20:16.984 --> 00:20:17.919 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

Oh, Mr. Guard! Hurry, come here!

in there?

to shoot your ass!

I'd say it's just
what you deserve.

You hurt my feelings,

you're gonna die for it!

Shut up and listen.

You said everything
has a name, didn't you?

00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.717 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then I'll name
my ability too.

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:24.786 position:21% line:89% align:start
It'll be Stone Ocean.

00:21:24.819 --> 00:21:26.821 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because somehow,
I'm gonna free myself

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.089 position:19% line:89% align:start
from this sea of stone.

as much as I need to,

be giving out orders here.

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:50.511 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now shrink me down

out of this hallway.

Are you really
sure you saw her?

Well, yeah, but I only
saw her from the back.
