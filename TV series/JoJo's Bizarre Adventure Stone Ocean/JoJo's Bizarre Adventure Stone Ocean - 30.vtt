Now that his memories
have been returned to him,

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:39.547 position:5% line:83% align:start
he could even destroy the ozone
layer if he wanted to.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.583 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you get it? The ozone layer
is way up there in the sky.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:43.684 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you know what will happen

to mess with it?

Was my arm melted because
of the destroyed ozone layer?

Answer us! Are you saying
that these rainbows mean

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.042 position:27% line:83% align:start
Weather Forecast
has his memory back?

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's his subconscious.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:12.113 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Ermes and Jolyne gasp]

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:13.548 position:16% line:89% align:start
Weather Forecast's Stand

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.482 position:21% line:83% align:start
sometimes functions
unconsciously.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.418 position:16% line:83% align:start
The climate can be quite
a difficult thing to control.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.521 position:19% line:83% align:start
So there are instances
where it manifests on its own,

00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:22.056 position:13% line:89% align:start
without him even noticing.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.257 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.592 position:13% line:89% align:start
The fact of the matter is,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.195 position:16% line:83% align:start
he never should have had
his memories returned to him.

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:28.696 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now, listen.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.833 position:7% line:83% align:start
In order to stop the rainbows,
you either need to kill Weather

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:35.402 position:10% line:83% align:start
or find a way to extract his
memories from him once more.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.305 position:13% line:89% align:start
Although, I don't believe

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
you're capable of
taking Weather's life, Jolyne.

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:40.908 position:24% line:89% align:start
And if you cannot,

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:43.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
everyone here will die
before the new moon.

[Jolyne]
Weather Forecast was able to

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
make frogs rain down
from the sky

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:31.752 position:13% line:89% align:start
during a freak storm once.

00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:33.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
But this situation
is nothing like that.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.656 position:13% line:83% align:start
What does this have to do
with Weather's ability

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.958 position:16% line:89% align:start
to control the weather?

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.226 position:16% line:83% align:start
And how does it connect
to this bizarre phenomenon?

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.162 position:27% line:89% align:start
On top of that,

00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:42.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's something
really strange

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
about the people
who have snails on them.

00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.299 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's like they're zombies!

00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:08.589 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:08:09.123 --> 00:08:10.691 position:21% line:89% align:start
But you know, Ermes.

00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:13.694 position:10% line:83% align:start
It could be that Stand Users
have a higher tolerance

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:15.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
to this phenomenon
than everyday people.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.065 position:35% line:89% align:start
So Jolyne,

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:20.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
which one of them
are we going after first?

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
Who will be the first to get
their ass handed to them?

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:24.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is Weather Forecast
our new enemy,

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.674 position:35% line:83% align:start
or rather,
are we gonna continue

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
tracking down Father Pucchi?

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.778 position:10% line:83% align:start

to be fighting here?

[gasps]

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
This new Weather Forecast
who has his memories back.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.818 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's our enemy, isn't he?

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:41.088 position:38% line:83% align:start
No way!
Weather Forecast is an ally.

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:42.957 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's not an enemy!

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.525 position:21% line:89% align:start
But Versus still is.

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:46.427 position:10% line:89% align:start
Didn't you hear the priest?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.929 position:13% line:83% align:start
He said not to let Versus
get away.

00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:51.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
Digging up the past
is his Stand's ability.

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:54.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] He might be able to
excavate Weather's memory disc,

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:56.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
and put an end
to this rainbow apocalypse!

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.339 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] All right, I see.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:00.007 position:27% line:83% align:start
But if we wanna
catch up to him,

[Verus] I want it too.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:29.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, I need it! Much more
than that damn priest.

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:30.304 position:16% line:89% align:start
Before he can get to it,

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to get my hands
on the power to go to heaven.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.509 position:30% line:83% align:start
And maybe then
I can finally be happy

00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:35.910 position:16% line:89% align:start
like I've always wanted.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:40.047 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, there is only one thing
that I, Verus, need to do.

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:41.749 position:16% line:89% align:start
Dig there, Netherworld!

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:43.717 position:33% line:89% align:start
I found it.

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.653 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've excavated the memory

to the hospital.

Hey, Ermes.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.659 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seeing as how we're closer
to tracking down Father Pucchi,

00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.227 position:7% line:89% align:start
this would be the safest time.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.295 position:21% line:89% align:start
We should do it now.

00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:55.429 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:55.463 --> 00:09:56.764 position:41% line:83% align:start
Giving
the Speedwagon Foundation

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.699 position:30% line:83% align:start
the disc with
my father's memory.

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:00.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's our best bet
to give it to them

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:02.571 position:33% line:83% align:start
while I have
the priest's attention.

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.339 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have faith that Emporio
can handle it himself.

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.741 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Finally,
my dad will be back to normal.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.544 position:7% line:89% align:start
So the friend who Jolyne Cujoh

00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:11.178 position:30% line:83% align:start
was talking to
over the radio earlier

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:13.114 position:13% line:89% align:start
goes by the name Emporio.

00:10:13.147 --> 00:10:14.882 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have to find him then.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.417 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not even Father Pucchi
knew a thing

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
about this mystery person.

00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:20.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
I haven't dug up
this Emporio guy's face yet,

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:22.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I don't know
what he looks like.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:24.593 position:5% line:89% align:start
But thanks to all of this mess,

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
it's likely that
he hasn't had a chance

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
to meet with the foundation.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Versus] And that means
he's still in possession

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.898 position:19% line:89% align:start
of Jotaro Kujo's disc.

00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
And from what the priest
has told me,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.201 position:5% line:89% align:start
he learned how to get to heaven

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:35.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
by reading said disc.

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:37.438 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can get a hold of
that disc,

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.173 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to
go to heaven too!

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:42.343 position:5% line:83% align:start
And my only shot at it is while
these rainbows are still here.

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:45.980 position:7% line:83% align:start
Mark my words, I'm gonna make

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whenever they pierce each other

Weather Forecast's ability

What the hell
is going on right now?

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:53.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
[narrator] In ancient times,
what we know as oxygen

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:55.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
was created when
the first forms of plant life

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
sprang to existence
on our Earth.

00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:00.154 position:7% line:89% align:start
When an additional oxygen atom

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:02.456 position:33% line:83% align:start
attaches to
the O2 oxygen molecule,

00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.058 position:21% line:89% align:start
the gas becomes O3,

00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:06.427 position:19% line:83% align:start
which is more commonly
referred to as the ozone.

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:09.863 position:30% line:83% align:start
Unlike oxygen,
ozone is quite dense.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.398 position:13% line:89% align:start
It exists as a thick shell

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:14.168 position:10% line:83% align:start
roughly 20 to 25 kilometers
from the Earth's surface.

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.737 position:33% line:83% align:start
If, one day,
the ozone layer

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
were to be suddenly
destroyed completely,

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:20.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
what would happen to
all living things

00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.842 position:10% line:89% align:start
that reside on planet Earth?

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.981 position:13% line:83% align:start
Humans are not capable of
predicting weather anomalies.

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:30.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
As a result, they can only work
with known data and hypothesize

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:33.354 position:16% line:83% align:start

All thanks to Netherworld.

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:16.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
With Jolyne's memories,

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.926 position:21% line:83% align:start
it was simple enough
to find Emporio's phone number.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.227 position:7% line:89% align:start
That must be the phone he used

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
to tell Jolyne
which seats on the plane

were safe so she didn't die
in the crash.

00:14:24.566 --> 00:14:26.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just had to dig up the number
from Jolyne's memory

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:29.069 position:7% line:89% align:start
and now I know the number too!

it was just in his hand!

Hold on, chill out.

I can find where he hid it
by excavating his memories

I know Emporio is hiding the
disc somewhere on his person.

00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:47.996 position:7% line:89% align:start
Does he have a secret pocket?

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:50.197 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's gotta be hiding it
inside of something.

Huh? Oh, I see.
Our Stands are rather similar.

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:01.643 position:19% line:89% align:start
So his Stand's ability

00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:03.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
is storing the memories
of objects.

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:05.880 position:24% line:89% align:start
I actually did it!

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:08.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jotaro Cujoh's disc
belongs to me!

It's finally in my hands!

00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:12.319 position:41% line:89% align:start
I won!

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:15.023 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, with this, I'm one more
step closer to attaining

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:16.824 position:24% line:83% align:start
what Father Pucchi

I'm really sorry, Emporio.

00:19:21.863 --> 00:19:24.966 position:13% line:83% align:start
If this was going to work,
I had to use you.

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:26.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'll be able to
save everyone

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:27.635 position:19% line:89% align:start
because you touched me

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:30.104 position:30% line:83% align:start
and, luckily,
he touched you as well.

00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:32.840 position:7% line:83% align:start

I'm innocent regarding

are these shells.

Hmm. Even more shells.

Wow, Weather.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't know what you did to
cause these snails to show up,

00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:01.129 position:13% line:89% align:start
or how it's even possible.

00:21:01.162 --> 00:21:02.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now I'm starting
to get an idea

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:05.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
of how this phenomenon's
going to end.

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.500 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's their predators.

00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:09.036 position:5% line:83% align:start
These bugs hunt down the snails
in order to feed on them.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.303 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all grunt]

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:12.439 position:35% line:83% align:start
Naturally,
snails move slow as hell,

00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:14.976 position:24% line:83% align:start
so being devoured
is how they usually go out.

00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:17.612 position:5% line:89% align:start
So in situations like this one,

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.279 position:38% line:83% align:start
the bugs
crawl into their shells,

00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:22.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
bite into their heads
and suck on their flesh.

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:24.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it's because of this
gruesome method of eating

00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:26.788 position:13% line:83% align:start
