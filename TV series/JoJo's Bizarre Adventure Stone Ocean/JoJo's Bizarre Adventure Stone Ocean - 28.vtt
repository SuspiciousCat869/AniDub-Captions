Okay, Ermes,

how fast is this thing going
right now?

took away the disc
with his memories

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.587 position:13% line:83% align:start

But this is a fucking hospital?

This is important.

I want you to take
my father's disc,

and deliver it for me.

If you call this number,

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Speedwagon Foundation
will come get it.

I wanna go in with you.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:24.532 position:41% line:83% align:start
I know.
But before that,

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need you to make sure
the disc gets delivered.

It's all up to you.

that I'm getting closer to him.

I don't wanna be separated

your opinion

on something I'm unsure of.

One bite is enough.

After you eat it, tell me
what ingredients are inside.

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:36.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
If there's shellfish,
I can't eat it.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.470 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm allergic,
so I would get quite sick.

Hm.

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:45.580 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is whitefish.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.082 position:21% line:89% align:start
Most likely flounder.

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:51.252 position:24% line:83% align:start
It has been paired
with this flan.

A delectable pudding
mixed with asparagus

00:05:54.222 --> 00:05:56.456 position:7% line:89% align:start
and mashed-up crab meat inside.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.458 position:19% line:89% align:start
I detect no shellfish.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.928 position:35% line:89% align:start

May I have another small bite,

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
but this time with a little dab
of sauce on the side?

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:08.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a faint scent
from the sauce.

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.939 position:13% line:89% align:start
Judging by the fishy aroma,

00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:14.108 position:10% line:83% align:start
I suspect it's scallop paste
mixed with cream.

00:06:22.984 --> 00:06:25.485 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Versus] How unfortunate.
Just as I thought.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.487 position:24% line:83% align:start

You're about

Yes.

I'm quite impressed
by your ability

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:05.159 position:19% line:83% align:start
to pick out the scallop
from the sauce.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.030 position:19% line:83% align:start

Tell me, Father Pucchi,

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.813 position:13% line:89% align:start
what are you trying to say?

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:29.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're aware I haven't seen
my own ability yet,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
and plus, I can sense someone

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:35.523 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to help
in any way I can.

What should I do?

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:38.960 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:07:40.428 --> 00:07:42.296 position:21% line:89% align:start
That can't be helped.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.099 position:10% line:83% align:start
In fact, their arrival might
actually prove useful to me.

Don't struggle against things

that the new enemy that's been
hanging around the priest

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:05.025 position:10% line:83% align:start

I bet Pucchi and his accomplice

plan to escape all the way
to Cape Canaveral like this.

In three days,

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:11.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
that man is going to
develop some new ability

that will help him attain
his absurd idea of heaven.

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:17.438 position:33% line:83% align:start
But for now,
all he has is Pale Snake,

00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.840 position:7% line:83% align:start

control the memories of other.

end this for good,

to all-out battle.

It's not surprising
that she would steal a pen

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.082 position:30% line:83% align:start
We weren't able
to land the plane safely.

00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:17.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the reason
why we crashed.

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:18.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
Holy shit!

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately for us,
we all burned to death.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.625 position:10% line:89% align:start
When the plane crash-landed,

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:27.128 position:33% line:89% align:start
it exploded.

00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:28.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that was when my body...

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:30.598 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gulping]

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
Um, excuse me, sir.
Did you not hear me

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
when I told everyone
to turn off

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:36.804 position:7% line:83% align:start
all of their electronic devices
earlier?

00:20:36.838 --> 00:20:37.839 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:20:37.872 --> 00:20:39.907 position:33% line:83% align:start
Could it be?
I... I think I remember this.

00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:43.477 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was Flight 2882, to Dallas.

00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:44.712 position:7% line:89% align:start
Around six or seven years ago,

00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:47.014 position:35% line:83% align:start
it crashed
somewhere near Orlando.

00:20:47.048 --> 00:20:48.583 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're dealing with ghosts here!

00:20:48.616 --> 00:20:50.518 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, we're memories. That's all.

00:20:50.551 --> 00:20:54.354 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remnants of memories that
were recorded by the Earth.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:55.489 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you trying to tell me

00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:57.357 position:21% line:83% align:start
we're actually gonna
crash in this thing?

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.561 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:06.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can you not make this plane
crash happen any faster?

00:21:06.601 --> 00:21:08.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've been sensing
Weather Forecast

00:21:08.236 --> 00:21:09.871 position:7% line:89% align:start
getting closer to our position.

[Father Pucchi] It appears that
he is drawing

00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:22.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
ever closer toward
this hospital.

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:25.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
I swear to God, if you don't
shut the fuck up already

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
and stop confusing me.

00:21:27.255 --> 00:21:29.557 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Were you speaking to me?

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:31.391 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.264 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Versus] Netherworld's ability
is to excavate

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.698 position:16% line:89% align:start
memories from the ground.

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:40.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
And this plane is set to crash

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.237 position:21% line:83% align:start
specifically at 21:33
on the dot.

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.272 position:10% line:89% align:start
Also, try not to forget that

00:21:44.304 --> 00:21:46.574 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've capitalized
on this opportunity

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:49.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
and managed to pull Ermes
into my hole as well.

00:21:49.577 --> 00:21:51.245 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:53.380 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Versus] I have done this
all for you, Father.

00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:55.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now just leave it to me.

00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:58.753 position:38% line:83% align:start
