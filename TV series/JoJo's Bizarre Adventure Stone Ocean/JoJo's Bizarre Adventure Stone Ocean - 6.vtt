[Emporio] The Green Dolphin
Street Penitentiary,

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.412 position:24% line:89% align:start
aka the "Aquarium."

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:16.985 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Mystery" and power were both
birthed here at some point.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.754 position:30% line:83% align:start
Something which
no ordinary people can see.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.589 position:19% line:89% align:start
And for those who can,

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:24.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
the "mystery" and "power"
remain foggy.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jolyne received
an additional five years

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
for attempting to escape

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:36.538 position:7% line:83% align:start
and has been in the punishment
cell for a few weeks now.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
Everything will start
after that.

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:41.074 position:33% line:89% align:start
Everything...

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:45.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
But before that happens,

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:48.148 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's something else
I need to look into.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's another prisoner.
-[footsteps approaching]

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.287 position:33% line:83% align:start
One that goes
by the name of...

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ermes Costello.

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:02.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's my understanding

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
that she and Jolyne
have already met.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.569 position:33% line:77% align:start
[gasps] Hey!
What do you think
you're doing?

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:08.736 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.971 position:19% line:89% align:start

[opening theme song playing]

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.187 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.956 position:21% line:89% align:start
That rotten janitor.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.258 position:16% line:83% align:start
Made off with what little
I'd saved.

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:13.393 position:33% line:89% align:start
God damn it!

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:14.261 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.496 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now I remember.

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:18.265 position:10% line:89% align:start
I hurt my hand on something,

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:20.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
and got a fever.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.806 position:33% line:83% align:start
But the wound
has practically disappeared.

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:27.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
Could I have been dreaming?

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, don't get ahead
of yourself.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.245 position:35% line:83% align:start
I remember.
It's coming back to me now.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.915 position:19% line:89% align:start
A five years sentence.

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:35.683 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was in custody for burglary

00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:37.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
waiting to be transferred
to this prison.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
I picked that thing up in
the meeting room in the jail.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.691 position:10% line:89% align:start
I saw it just sitting there.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.693 position:21% line:89% align:start
But knowing my luck,

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:49.831 position:7% line:83% align:start
I cut my hand pretty bad on it,
which totally pissed me off.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:50.965 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who was it?

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
What was that woman's name?

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.969 position:21% line:89% align:start
Gwess! That's right.

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
I sold that thing to her.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.238 position:27% line:89% align:start
And that night...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.474 position:21% line:89% align:start
I somehow passed out,

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:03.177 position:21% line:89% align:start
and now... here I am.

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.680 position:33% line:83% align:start
Have I really
been sleeping since then?

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.716 position:7% line:89% align:start
And my wound is mostly healed.

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.522 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:16.657 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, what's the deal
with this sticker?

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:20.995 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:22.362 position:21% line:83% align:start
I already peeled off
the sticker

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.431 position:21% line:83% align:start
that was on the palm
of my hand.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
Am I remembering
this correctly?

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
In 1492, Columbus sailed

I'm certain of it.

What the--?! I thought
I'd already thrown it away!

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.986 position:13% line:89% align:start
Something seems different.

But what... is it...?

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:50.323 position:24% line:89% align:start

Hold on,
now there are five again!

cause astigmatism in my eyes?

But there's that sticker...
[shudders]

No, this is...

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:34.068 position:10% line:83% align:start
definitely not an astigmatism
from having a high fever!

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.837 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm definitely touching it.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.171 position:24% line:89% align:start

This sticker!

Wherever I place it,

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:42.342 position:10% line:83% align:start
it creates an exact duplicate
of the object!

that I took from

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
that sick prisoner is all mine.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:56.544 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:07:56.577 --> 00:08:00.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've hidden 5000 bucks,
and nobody has clue.

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:02.450 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wha--What am I watching?

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:08.155 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Pale Snake] McQueen,
my child.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.858 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think you could
lend me a hand with something?

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
A little something
between friends.

00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:14.428 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, what do you say?

00:08:14.462 --> 00:08:16.397 position:35% line:89% align:start

[sighs] What the hell did
that thing just show me?

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:22.703 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was like I was
watching someone's memory.

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:23.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[janitor] So...
-Huh?

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:25.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
Word's gotten 'round.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:29.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've been asking people
all about me, huh?

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.178 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have prior experience
in stalking,

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:35.049 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I've gotta say I've never
been stalked by a woman before.

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:37.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, this is a first.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:39.253 position:30% line:83% align:start
Who the hell do
you think you are?

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:40.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
Answer me!

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:43.357 position:13% line:83% align:start
Didn't you eject some discs
out of your face?

00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.625 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, discs?

00:08:53.502 --> 00:08:56.303 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't remember.
What going on?

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:59.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so pathetic.
I can't remember.

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.075 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:04.078 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, why'd you bust out
crying all of a sudden?

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
You took money from me
while I was unconscious

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
in sickbay this morning,
stupid ass!

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:10.751 position:13% line:89% align:start
Money? That's sounds right.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:14.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had thousands of dollars
stashed away in a safe place.

00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:15.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
But now...

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:16.957 position:13% line:83% align:start
[wailing] I have no memory
of where it was.

00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:19.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
Damn, are you sure
you're all right there, man?

00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:21.162 position:16% line:83% align:start
You better not be messing
with me!

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:22.063 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sniffs]

00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:25.933 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you just ask me
if I'm all right?

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:26.734 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sparkles]

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:29.070 position:16% line:89% align:start
I... I... You're so kind.

00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:32.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's been forever since the
last time I spoke with a woman.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.643 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Well, it's my first time.

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:36.811 position:21% line:89% align:start
My first time to have

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:38.846 position:10% line:83% align:start
a heart-to-heart conversation
with a woman

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.516 position:16% line:83% align:start
as staggeringly beautiful
as you are.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.019 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm very happy, honestly.

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:47.021 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someday, I hope
to meet a girl like you

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:50.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
and get the chance to
live happily together with her.

00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:50.991 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.026 position:33% line:89% align:start
Of course...

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
That won't happen
because I'm a pathetic loser.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
And why would you want
someone like that?

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:59.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's all so pointless.

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel like dying.

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:03.204 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Wait!
-[choking]

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.639 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

[grunting]

00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:13.280 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh god! Who is this guy?

00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:21.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
[buzzing]

00:10:22.524 --> 00:10:24.258 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, McQueen.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:27.661 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're truly evil
and a misanthrope, aren't you?

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.698 position:27% line:83% align:start
You worm your way
through this world

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:32.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
with no animosity,
and worst of all,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
you don't even think you're
causing anyone any trouble.

00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:39.039 position:30% line:83% align:start
You also insist
on playing the victim.

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:41.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
Although you have
no interest in others,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're hoping that someone
will come along

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.913 position:7% line:89% align:start
one of these days and save you.

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:49.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're what's referred to in
certain circles as "the worst."

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
Dragging others down
with your misfortune

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:54.922 position:16% line:89% align:start
is a truly evil approach.

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.625 position:13% line:89% align:start
Which makes me have to say,

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:59.393 position:19% line:83% align:start
"I'm quite fond of you,
McQueen."

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:01.028 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you were to come across
my enemy

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:02.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you're moving
about this prison,

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:05.933 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'd be sure to get rid of them
for me like a true friend.

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, McQueen?

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:09.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
[pained groan]

00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.372 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] Belt is around

00:11:12.173 --> 00:11:13.542 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:20.381 position:13% line:89% align:start
Help me! Please, somebody!

00:11:21.616 --> 00:11:23.384 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm passing out.

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:26.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe if I can bring
him down,

00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
this power will release me
as well!

He has a strange ability
like mine.

00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:45.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
That means I wasn't
the only one.

00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:48.709 position:38% line:83% align:start
Damn it!
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:51.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why'd you hang yourself
like that?

00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:54.415 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you really just help me?

00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:57.251 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
You're a real lifesaver.

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.621 position:33% line:83% align:start
Who the hell
do you think you are, asshole?

00:11:59.654 --> 00:12:01.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why the hell do you keep
dragging me into your problems?

00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:04.559 position:38% line:83% align:start
You have
some power too, right?

00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:06.160 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't lie to me!

00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:09.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
My power? I don't know
what you're talking about,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.699 position:21% line:89% align:start
but that'll be okay.

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
I won't ever do that again.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:14.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm fully awake now.

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:17.438 position:13% line:83% align:start
I really owe you everything
for saving my life.

Those scars on his wrist.

He's tried to
commit suicide before.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.398 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I don't think
he's realized

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
his ability affects
those around him yet.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:48.703 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's bad news.

My posture's even
the same as his!

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:53.941 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh god, I drifted
even further away from him.

Please let me die!

anything.

be murdered,

onto their exposed skin.

That's not how it works.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.754 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's all due
to electrical resistance.

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:28.823 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's why it stopped.

00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:30.324 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.594 position:35% line:89% align:start
However...

00:16:32.627 --> 00:16:35.996 position:10% line:83% align:start

electrocuting himself again,

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:37.164 position:27% line:89% align:start
then I'm thinking

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:40.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
he's probably looking
for salt water.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.102 position:27% line:83% align:start
With salt \water,
the current conductivity

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:43.905 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be almost 100 percent.

00:16:48.643 --> 00:16:50.143 position:13% line:89% align:start

Four years ago...

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:48.870 position:27% line:83% align:start

Huh?

00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:54.042 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.375 position:38% line:89% align:start
Somehow,

[McQueen] It was an accident!

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:03.751 position:30% line:83% align:start
My room was on
the tenth floor.

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:06.253 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's when a woman jumped

in an attempt to kill herself.

00:18:09.222 --> 00:18:11.325 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a matter of luck.

00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:13.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
People win millions
in the lottery.

00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:16.463 position:16% line:83% align:start
so obviously the opposite
has to happen, right?

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:19.166 position:19% line:83% align:start
She was supposed to hit
the ground

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:21.468 position:21% line:89% align:start
and die from suicide.

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.538 position:10% line:89% align:start
But instead, everyone assumes

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:26.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
that I shot and killed
that woman on the 11th floor.

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:28.509 position:30% line:83% align:start
The judge even

Wait!

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:35.917 position:16% line:89% align:start
You like panties, right?

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
Has anyone ever given you
a pair!?

00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:39.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
If a cute girl were
to give you panties,

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:41.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
you'd feel lucky,
wouldn't you?

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:42.724 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:42.757 --> 00:18:45.459 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sure, you're going through
some tough times right now.

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:47.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if you were given
freshly worn panties,

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.229 position:7% line:83% align:start
that means your luck can change

Oh, how embarrassing,

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:56.236 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:58.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
The actual pair I'm wearing
right this second.

to me?

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:06.914 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course! I made a promise,
didn't I?

00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:09.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
But listen, everybody hates

and Monday's
right around the corner.

00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:12.587 position:27% line:89% align:start
But we all think,

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
"A fun Saturday is waiting
for me at

00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:16.223 position:7% line:83% align:start
the other end of this tunnel,"
and live our lives,

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:18.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
because we know it's not
always going to be a Monday.

00:19:18.693 --> 00:19:21.062 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MNS] The day I got arrested
was Saturday.

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.864 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-It's strange.

00:19:22.897 --> 00:19:25.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying something good
that gives me courage,

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:26.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
which I appreciate.

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:29.302 position:19% line:83% align:start
But maybe you're using
all those fine-sounding words

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
because you're trying
to save yourself, right?

00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:33.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, that's part of it.

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:35.342 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you're acting like
you care,

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.645 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you're just trying
to calm me down

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:38.680 position:30% line:89% align:start
for the moment.

00:19:38.713 --> 00:19:41.816 position:24% line:83% align:start
The words you speak
are not sincere, are they?

00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:45.753 position:13% line:89% align:start
So that's how you treat me.

00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:48.488 position:13% line:83% align:start
I should've known this all
from the start.

00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:50.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
No one wants to be
with trash.

00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:52.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I'm worse than trash.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:54.095 position:16% line:89% align:start
My presence is invisible!

00:19:54.128 --> 00:19:55.328 position:16% line:89% align:start
You couldn't even find me

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
to throw me away properly!

00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa! Pump the brakes, man.

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:01.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, I'll admit that
the only reason I talked to you

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
is because I wanna
survive this.

00:20:03.004 --> 00:20:05.238 position:7% line:89% align:start
Right, I have to make you see.

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:08.142 position:5% line:83% align:start
This "Pale Snake" son of a bitch
is only using you.

00:20:08.176 --> 00:20:10.578 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's taking advantage
of your broken heart!

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.345 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if you stop thinking
about suicide,

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.413 position:21% line:89% align:start
nothing will happen.

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:15.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
He won't have power
over you anymore.

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:16.784 position:35% line:89% align:start
Maybe then,

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:18.853 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll stop thinking
only about your damn self,

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:21.756 position:10% line:83% align:start
which is just what you need,
you shit stain!

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:23.791 position:27% line:89% align:start
[abrupt silence]

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.163 position:19% line:89% align:start
Jeez, you're so great.

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:31.666 position:35% line:83% align:start
I mean it.
Your heart spoke to me.

00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:33.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have me feeling
so inspired now.

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:37.071 position:21% line:83% align:start
It really shows a guy
just how lucky he is.

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.539 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm getting the chance to meet

00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:39.807 position:27% line:83% align:start
an amazing person
such as yourself

00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:40.842 position:21% line:89% align:start
right before the end.

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:44.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
And for that I'd like
to thank you!

00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:46.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I can make sure to die
with you,

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:49.382 position:27% line:83% align:start
then we can stay
together forever.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:52.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
I never realized
I could be so happy!

00:20:52.987 --> 00:20:55.723 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
That evil little prick.

00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:58.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
He really has to be
the most loathsome,

00:20:58.325 --> 00:21:01.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
corrupt son of a bitch
I've ever met!

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:05.566 position:16% line:77% align:start
I never have to be lonely
anymore!
[cackles]

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
Asshole!

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't even think
about hitting that button!

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:10.972 position:35% line:89% align:start
[crackles]

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:13.007 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:23.651 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was too close.
That damned idiot.

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:26.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was able to put a sticker
on him.

00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:28.022 position:30% line:83% align:start
The sparks from
the electricity

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:29.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
should burn it off.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:31.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
And when the sticker
is burned off,

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.261 position:16% line:83% align:start
and then the object that
the sticker

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.395 position:16% line:89% align:start
split in two is gonna...

00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.832 position:21% line:89% align:start
merge back together!

00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:38.900 position:35% line:89% align:start
[squelches]

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:47.975 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ermes groans] Damn it.

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:51.579 position:10% line:89% align:start
The shock made me remember...

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:54.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
This moron hid a bunch
of money around here somewhere.

00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:56.316 position:35% line:89% align:start
Five grand.

00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:59.486 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll take that money
as payment, you asshole!

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.156 position:10% line:89% align:start
And as for you... Pale Snake.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
I suffered a lot
because of you.

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:06.326 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the hell
are you scheming?

00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:14.302 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need to see her.

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:17.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've got questions,
Jolyne Cujoh.
