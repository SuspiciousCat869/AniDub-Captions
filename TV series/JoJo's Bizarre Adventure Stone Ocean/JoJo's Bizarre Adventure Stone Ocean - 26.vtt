the Stand User
isn't in this town.

If they were going to launch

so that I can prove
you were always innocent.

So please, come back to me!

[breathing heavily]

00:19:52.627 --> 00:19:53.528 position:27% line:89% align:start
[exhales deeply]

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.771 position:13% line:83% align:start
Awesome, you got the keys
to his car. [chuckles]

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.274 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hello?
Yes, my name is Romeo Jisso,

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:08.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I live in Palm Beach.

00:20:08.943 --> 00:20:10.578 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is this the police?

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd like to report
an escaped convict.

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:16.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, her name is Jolyne Cujoh.

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:18.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like I thought.

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:20.621 position:10% line:83% align:start
Aren't you glad I told you
to plant one of my stickers

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:23.157 position:30% line:83% align:start
on that pendejo
and split it in two?

00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:26.460 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's already calling the cops.
That snitch.

00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:28.295 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Romeo] No, you're mistaken!

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.665 position:10% line:83% align:start
She never came to my house.
She couldn't have.

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:32.533 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm calling in to report

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
because I just received
a call from her.

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:36.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's all.

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:38.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
She was begging for money,
but I turned her down.

00:20:39.707 --> 00:20:41.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think she said
she was headed for Mexico.

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:42.977 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.680 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course, if she calls again,
I'll let you know.

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:48.482 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes. Goodbye.

00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:51.119 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, damn, look at that.

00:20:51.152 --> 00:20:53.688 position:5% line:89% align:start
He didn't betray you after all.

00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:56.023 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Romeo] If only she could
forgive me one day.

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:57.491 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd do anything for her.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.529 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Hey, check it out.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.198 position:30% line:83% align:start
Isn't it cool?
Your ex is loaded.

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.833 position:24% line:83% align:start
What do you think
he gave you?

00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:08.503 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sure, his car keys are here,
but that's not all.

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look at that thing.

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:12.707 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gentle music]

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:16.844 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are we really allowed
to take that one?

00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.478 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wanna try steering.

00:21:18.513 --> 00:21:21.048 position:19% line:83% align:start
Flying the real thing
must be way different

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:22.717 position:27% line:83% align:start
from just reading
about it in books.

00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:28.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
Romeo, you've changed.
I believe you.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:35.428 position:7% line:83% align:start
But let's peel it off anyway.
Just in case.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:37.297 position:41% line:89% align:start
Damn.

00:21:38.766 --> 00:21:40.768 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Romeo screaming]

00:21:40.802 --> 00:21:41.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's get outta here.

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:43.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne]
If we take the helicopter,

00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.438 position:27% line:83% align:start
we can get there
in a few hours.

00:21:48.142 --> 00:21:49.911 position:24% line:83% align:start
["Distant Dreamer"
by Duffy playing]

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.001 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rikiel] Father,

00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:22.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
I understand that my mission
will be protecting you.

00:23:24.005 --> 00:23:27.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
But before that,
will you please open my eyes?

00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:29.277 position:7% line:89% align:start
You see, one of my eyelids...

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.312 position:13% line:89% align:start
it keeps on drooping down.

00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:33.014 position:13% line:89% align:start
And it doesn't go back up.

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:36.584 position:13% line:89% align:start
It only goes up sometimes.
