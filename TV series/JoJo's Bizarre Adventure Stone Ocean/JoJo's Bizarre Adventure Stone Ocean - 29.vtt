[guard] Back up. Keep going.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who is it that you sensed
nearby, Weather?

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.582 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you saying that
Jolyne's the one

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:15.917 position:16% line:89% align:start
that's near the hospital?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.219 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or do you mean the priest is
the person that's already here?

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:22.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
Actually, I can sense
three people, Anastasia.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jolyne is one of them,
the priest is here too.

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:27.327 position:13% line:89% align:start
But there is somebody else.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.631 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] We gotta find them,
but where are they?

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:31.533 position:21% line:83% align:start
Could they be inside
one of these buildings?

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.503 position:24% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, ladies.

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:37.070 position:30% line:89% align:start
Welcome aboard.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.373 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, this plane
is expected to lose control

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
and crash into the ground
at approximately 21:33

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.846 position:24% line:89% align:start
on July 21st, 2005.

-[Jolyne grunts]
-Hey, hold on!

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you think
you're doing, Jolyne?

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're not planning
on opening that door, are you?

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wasn't able to find
the exit on the ceiling,

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.360 position:7% line:83% align:start
so the fastest way to end this
is to find the Stand User

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
-and attack him directly.
-[gulps]

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.165 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Ermes, hold on tight
to my rope again.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
And strap yourself in
somewhere.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:08.970 position:7% line:89% align:start
And you, flight attendant lady,

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.237 position:24% line:83% align:start
switch the settings
on this door

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.639 position:7% line:89% align:start
so that I can open it manually.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? Yo, hang on.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.044 position:10% line:83% align:start
It ain't exactly a good idea
to open the door

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
when the plane's still moving,
you know.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.346 position:13% line:83% align:start
-The air pressure would...
-[door clicking]

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Nah, never mind.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.754 position:35% line:89% align:start
Go for it!

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.157 position:10% line:83% align:start
Use the air pressure to slam
into those motherfuckers!

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.191 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Stone Ocean] Oraa!

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.093 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.700 position:19% line:89% align:start
[pilot] Mayday. Mayday.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
It looks like we just got hit
by a damn MiG.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.270 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've lost all control.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.807 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess finishing them
will be easier than I thought.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
[pilot] Hm? Hey, who are you?

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway, I think the back of
the plane took a serious hit.

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:54.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can you go check out
how bad the damage is?

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.383 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.694 position:27% line:89% align:start
[strained groan]

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:08.896 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, shit!

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.265 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jolyne!

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.468 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stone Ocean!

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:16.804 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Versus] Hm.

00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:18.405 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is officer McCoy here.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
We just arrived at the scene.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.175 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not sure what happened.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't tell how deep it is
from the surface, but...

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:25.647 position:21% line:89% align:start
there's a large hole.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.481 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yelps]

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:29.684 position:30% line:83% align:start
As I told you,
Jolyne Cujoh's skills

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:31.119 position:16% line:89% align:start
were sharpened in prison.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
She already anticipated
what would happen

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.723 position:10% line:83% align:start
in the event that her initial
attack was a failure.

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:38.392 position:21% line:83% align:start
Clearly, this is why
she got out of the airplane.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.995 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was waiting
for the police to arrive

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
so that they would
use their radio,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.231 position:7% line:89% align:start
giving her a chance to grab it.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now she can contact her allies.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:48.168 position:10% line:89% align:start
Depending on frequency range,

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
that radio can be used
to call cell phones as well.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shut the fuck up already.
Enough.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.743 position:33% line:83% align:start
Does it look
like I'm losing here? Huh?

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.444 position:16% line:89% align:start
Answer me, Father Pucchi.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm still winning
this damn battle, aren't I?

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.951 position:33% line:89% align:start
[theme music]

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.143 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Versus] Growing up,
I never knew

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:37.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
who my real father was
or what he did.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I got so sick
of my mom and stepdad,

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:42.049 position:21% line:83% align:start
who blatantly favored
my half sisters,

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.651 position:27% line:89% align:start
then I ran away.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:44.685 position:38% line:89% align:start
I was 13.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.854 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't have any cash,

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:48.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
so it was only gonna be
for a few days,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.825 position:16% line:83% align:start
but as I was looking for
a place to spend the night,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
a pair of spiked shoes
came falling from the sky.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.030 position:13% line:89% align:start
They were baseball spikes.

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:58.266 position:7% line:89% align:start
And they had a real nice smell.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I looked up to see
if someone threw them

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:01.269 position:16% line:89% align:start
from the building above.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.469 position:19% line:89% align:start
But they looked so new.

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.707 position:33% line:83% align:start
The shoe size
was 28.5 centimeters.

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:08.709 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though they were
way too big for me,

00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.443 position:13% line:83% align:start
I liked the clacking sound
the spikes made

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.146 position:7% line:89% align:start
when I walked down the street.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.916 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I decided to keep them on
for a while.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
It wasn't long until some cops
came and arrested me.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.554 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gavel clanging]

00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:22.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
This hearing today
is not a formal trial.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just want to ask
some questions.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:26.194 position:35% line:89% align:start
Understood?

00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:29.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did you steal those shoes
you were wearing?

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.132 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Versus] Turns out,
those spikes were signed

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:32.700 position:33% line:83% align:start
by the famous
baseball player, Ichiro,

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.536 position:16% line:83% align:start
and donated to a facility
for children with disabilities.

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:38.506 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you sold them
to a collector,

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
they would have gone
as high as ten grand.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:43.443 position:24% line:83% align:start
So everybody wanted
to get their hands on them.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:46.147 position:27% line:83% align:start
Like a dumb kid,
I told the truth.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
They came falling
out of the sky.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
How dare you steal
from children less fortunate!

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.688 position:30% line:83% align:start
You need to be
straightened out.

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:57.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Go spend some time
in juvenile detention facility!

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.259 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Versus]
The judge found me guilty

00:05:58.292 --> 00:05:59.459 position:13% line:89% align:start
on circumstantial evidence

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
and sentenced me
to six months in juvy.

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.631 position:24% line:83% align:start
And even my parents
agreed to it.

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:06.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
Four months later,

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:07.935 position:10% line:89% align:start
the actual culprit confessed.

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.104 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since Ichiro's spikes
were so famous,

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:11.505 position:7% line:89% align:start
the thief knew they'd be found

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.608 position:10% line:83% align:start
and threw them in an air vent
to be rid of them.

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:15.910 position:13% line:83% align:start
And somehow, they ended up
outside of the building.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.349 position:10% line:83% align:start
By the time it was discovered
that I was wrongly condemned,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was already crippled
in mind and body.

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:26.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
To the point where I was
too weak to even walk straight.

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:29.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
One day, I fell into
a random hole in the fields.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.892 position:30% line:83% align:start
In the moment,
all I could think about

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.393 position:21% line:83% align:start
was breaking my fall
by extending my hand out.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that's when I saw
a knife in a plastic bag

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.031 position:13% line:89% align:start
that had been buried there.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.431 position:7% line:89% align:start
It went right through my hand.

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:39.533 position:38% line:83% align:start
[inmate]
What do you think you're doing

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.535 position:16% line:89% align:start
causing me trouble, kid?

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was hiding that knife there
for a reason, you know.

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:46.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Versus] The next day,
a guy three years older than me

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
kicked my ass. He was

00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:50.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
a gangster's little
bitch that did his dirty work.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even though my hand
was treated by a doctor,

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:55.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
two weeks later, my wound
was still expelling pus

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
and worms even started
crawling out of it.

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:00.288 position:16% line:83% align:start
After that, I nearly died
from a high fever.

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.157 position:7% line:83% align:start
Since then, I've tried to live
a bitter life of solitude.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.360 position:10% line:83% align:start
Keeping away from the public
eye as much as possible.

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:07.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
[urine pattering]Then
one day, when I was takin

00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:09.764 position:50% line:83% align:start
g
a piss by some garbage cans,

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
the wall started to crumble

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:12.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
and revealed
the skeletal remains

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.602 position:35% line:83% align:start
of a woman
who died years ago.

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.071 position:10% line:89% align:start
And now, after all this time,

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.540 position:7% line:83% align:start
the reason why my life has been
so utterly fucked up

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:22.043 position:7% line:89% align:start
is finally crystal clear to me.

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:25.579 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's my ability, Netherworld!

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:28.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
But still, just because
I can control my power now,

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:31.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
am I really supposed to
be grateful to Father Pucchi

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.754 position:19% line:83% align:start
for helping me realize
my full potential?

00:07:33.788 --> 00:07:35.356 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hell no.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
The blood that's been
running through my veins

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:38.491 position:24% line:89% align:start
all along is Dio's,

00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:39.927 position:35% line:89% align:start
my father.

00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:41.395 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, priest,

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:44.598 position:7% line:83% align:start
do you honestly believe you're
that important to all of this?

00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:45.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you not think that I would

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
throw your ass
onto that plane as well?

00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:52.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't even failed yet.
I haven't done anything wrong!

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:54.675 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's just like that old bitch
of a judge

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:56.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
who only values
her own opinion.

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm really starting to
lose my patience

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.781 position:10% line:89% align:start
with this so-called holy man.

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:03.351 position:33% line:83% align:start
I am the one
who is invincible here.

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:05.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anything is possible
if I use Netherworld!

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:17.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why is he the only one?
On the new moon,

00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:20.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
maybe it should be me
who comes out on top.

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
What if I'm the one who
acquires Dio's power instead,

00:08:23.371 --> 00:08:25.106 position:16% line:89% align:start
and not that damn priest?

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:26.440 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have every right to it.

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:28.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
After all, I am Dio's son!

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:29.844 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps softly]

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's Weather Forecast's
memory disc.

00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:38.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe this can be used
to put things in my favor.

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:41.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
The only one who gets
to attain heaven should be me.

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.125 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jolyne!

[wind whooshing]

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:49.897 position:13% line:83% align:start
[breathes heavily] Come on,
Emporio, pick up the phone!

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.499 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now, Emporio!

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:54.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hey Mr. pilot, what kind
of jet fighter is this?

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
And how the hell
do I get outta here?

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be some way
to break loose,

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.540 position:7% line:89% align:start
even if I'm still sitting down.

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:01.308 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've seen it in lots of movies.

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.644 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hurry the fuck up
and tell me how!

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:06.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
The seat has a lever
you can pull to eject yourself.

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:09.950 position:13% line:83% align:start
But in my case, I never got
the chance to escape.

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:12.486 position:21% line:83% align:start
My jet hit the ground
before I was able to pull it.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:13.587 position:24% line:89% align:start
That is the truth.

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:17.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why nobody is gonna
be getting off this aircraft.

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.294 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's already too late to pull
the ejection lever in time.

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:22.096 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:23.731 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] Jolyne,
is something wrong?

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
calling so soon?

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.868 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen, Emporio!

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.271 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Right now, we're in a
big hole in the hospital floor

00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:32.973 position:7% line:83% align:start
and Ermes is riding on a plane
that's gonna crash!

00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:35.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm in a fighter jet
that's also about to crash!

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.311 position:27% line:83% align:start
Find a way for us
to get outta here!

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:39.280 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:41.949 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Versus] Father Pucchi,

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:44.785 position:16% line:83% align:start
do we need Jolyne's body
intact after this?

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:46.087 position:10% line:89% align:start
They weren't able to retrieve

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.788 position:7% line:83% align:start
all of the jet fighter pilot's
remains

00:09:47.822 --> 00:09:49.423 position:19% line:89% align:start
after the jet crashed.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:52.493 position:7% line:89% align:start
You see, he was blown to bits.

00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:55.564 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on.
Just calm down, Jolyne.

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:57.566 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand
what you're saying at all.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.266 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll head back to the hospital
right away.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, don't come here, Emporio.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.870 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're trapped
in an incident from the past!

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:04.972 position:35% line:83% align:start
This crash
is already predetermined.

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:05.973 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne]
The only way to survive it

00:10:06.006 --> 00:10:07.576 position:7% line:89% align:start
is to escape from the cockpit,

00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:08.676 position:19% line:89% align:start
but I have no idea how.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:09.844 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Ermes]
It's no use.

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
We ain't gonna make it.
We're out of time.

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's less than
a minute remaining

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:17.351 position:7% line:83% align:start
and the fighter jet Jolyne's on
is gonna crash even sooner.

Wait, the jet fighter didn't...

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:27.995 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're absolutely right.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.798 position:44% line:83% align:start
It...
it didn't blow up, Emporio.

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.466 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even though I crashed the jet
into the plane,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
it didn't explode!

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.636 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Emporio]
There's no way it would.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.638 position:10% line:83% align:start
If it crashes into the ground
in the past,

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:39.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
then it won't blow up
until that happens.

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:41.610 position:35% line:83% align:start
Until then,
no matter what you do,

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:43.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
neither of the planes
will explode.

00:10:43.512 --> 00:10:45.980 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yo, Jolyne!
-[Jolyne] I'm back!

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:48.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Emporio, help me
figure out what to do next?

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:49.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's see.

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:52.621 position:7% line:89% align:start
In a miraculous turn of events,

00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:55.456 position:33% line:83% align:start
six years ago
on Flight 2882 to Dallas,

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
two of the passengers
survived somehow.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:00.529 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm looking the story up
right now on my ghost computer.

00:11:00.562 --> 00:11:02.597 position:7% line:89% align:start
You need to get to their seats!

00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:04.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
Escaping from that airplane
is impossible,

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:07.368 position:7% line:83% align:start
but if this is really an event
that occurred in the past,

00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.870 position:10% line:83% align:start
you should be able to survive
if you sit in those seats.

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:13.440 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Hurry Emporio!
Find out which seats they are!

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:15.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, that's Jolyne Cujoh
for you.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.879 position:10% line:83% align:start
She always figures out a way
to create her own path.

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:21.148 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now then,
do you think you're capable of

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
getting the job done?
Huh, Versus?

00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:25.554 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Versus] Shut your mouth!

00:11:25.587 --> 00:11:27.288 position:33% line:83% align:start
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.092 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Found it, Jolyne!

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:33.928 position:27% line:83% align:start
An old newspaper
recorded the seats

00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:36.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
the survivors were sitting in
at the time of the crash.

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:38.365 position:33% line:83% align:start
It looks like
they're in Economy class,

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
seats 51D and 51F.

00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:42.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
From all the way in the back.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
And you should know
they weren't lying

00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:46.073 position:13% line:83% align:start
about the time of the crash
being 21:33.

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:47.107 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's the truth!

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:47.808 position:27% line:89% align:start
Run, Jolyne, run!

00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:51.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
The enemy's inside
the plane with us!

00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:53.113 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's trying to get to
those seats before we do.

00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:55.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
He wants to destroy them
so we can't sit.

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:57.351 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Netherworld] Thirty-two
seconds until impact.

It's not that big of a deal.

[Jolyne panting]

00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.557 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Netherworld]
Just prevent them from sitting.

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.358 position:38% line:83% align:start
Doing so
will bring about their end.

Luckily,
those two seats endured

I won't let you dig up

You lose, Pucchi!

Come on, Jolyne, kill his ass
before he gets away.

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.839 position:19% line:89% align:start
When did you steal it?

blown away by Jolyne's punch?

You must return it.

Until now,
I've spent my life in shame

and unable to

why I was born into this world.

You don't understand
a single solitary thing.

00:20:00.535 --> 00:20:03.971 position:7% line:83% align:start
It is imperative that that man
does not retrieve his memory.

At least
not for another three days.

to kill me anymore.

He's going to get
his memory back.

00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:26.627 position:7% line:83% align:start
I know this because I just read
the contents of his disc.

00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:28.428 position:19% line:83% align:start
And when he does regain
his memories,

your so-called friend
will not be your ally.

that poor Weather Forecast

has had to deal with.

your Netherworld
