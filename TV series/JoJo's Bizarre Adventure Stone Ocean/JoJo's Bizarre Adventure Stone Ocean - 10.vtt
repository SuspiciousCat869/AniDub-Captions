All right! I finally found
obtained the disc

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:10.477 position:10% line:89% align:start
that contains Star Platinum!

Jolyne Cujoh.

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is it possible she
defeated that incompetent guard

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
and took the disc all
by herself?

I'm gonna get my dad's disc
out of this prison.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that includes the one
Pale Snake's holding onto.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:29.697 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just watch.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.700 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Pale Snake] Of course,

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
I erased all knowledge
of myself

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.436 position:10% line:89% align:start
from Miraschon's memory disc.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.272 position:24% line:89% align:start
An obvious choice.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.509 position:30% line:83% align:start
And therefore,
nobody can reach me.

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:43.410 position:13% line:83% align:start
The true difference between
a human

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
and an animal is
nothing less than

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
whether or not they desire
to go to heaven after they die.

[crunch]

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.285 position:7% line:83% align:start
People should live their lives
in such a manner

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.153 position:24% line:83% align:start
that they'll be let
into heaven.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.656 position:30% line:89% align:start
For that is...

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:58.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
the beauty inherent
in the nature of humankind.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.236 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Hey, move it.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to use
the phone now, right?

00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:52.272 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you insane, girl?!

This is all I could find.

Just listen for one second.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:37.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm an inmate incarcerated

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.453 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the Green Dolphin Street
Prison in Florida,

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.756 position:10% line:89% align:start
and my name is Jolyne Cujoh.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.759 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please connect me to somebody
who knows what that means.

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:47.161 position:33% line:89% align:start

[clicks] Sorry for the wait.

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.871 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you the daughter
of Professor Jotaro Kujo?

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:57.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
And you are?

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.508 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm just
a foundation representative.

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:03.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
Also, so you know,
I'm not a Stand User.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.179 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:07.380 position:19% line:83% align:start
Still, you clearly know
about Stands though.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you happen to know
anything about discs?

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.057 position:10% line:83% align:start
After Dr. Jotaro Kujo's body
was retrieved from the UUV,

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
he wasn't transferred here
to Dallas.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.228 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nevertheless, rest assured,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.429 position:13% line:83% align:start
his body is being sheltered
in a safe area.

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:24.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
[sighs] However...

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's really rather unfortunate,
you see,

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
but there are, well...

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.972 position:27% line:83% align:start
no signs of life,
medically speaking.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Shit...

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:36.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
Would you believe me
that he could be revived?

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:40.148 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm merely a scientist.
I can't.

00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:42.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've obtained one disc.
I have it.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
He'll come back to life.

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:45.352 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm certain that

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.655 position:16% line:83% align:start
my father will definitely
regenerate with this.

[man sighs]

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
I want to give the foundation
this disc

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.260 position:19% line:89% align:start
by any means necessary,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.195 position:21% line:89% align:start
but I don't know how.

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.164 position:24% line:83% align:start
You need to come up
with an idea.

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:58.365 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to get the disc
out of this prison.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
Immediately.

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:01.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, miss, but

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.905 position:7% line:83% align:start
isn't this call being recorded
by the prison?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, it probably is.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
Trust me, I'm fully aware
of that possibility,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.343 position:16% line:89% align:start
but I have no time, sir.

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.880 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's extremely urgent.
It's now or never.

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:15.249 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm in an unbelievably
dangerous situation.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:17.018 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't safely hide the disc
anywhere.

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.519 position:35% line:89% align:start
[man sighs]

00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:20.922 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be a way
for this to work.

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:22.322 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just so you know, though,

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.292 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not allowed
to have any visitors.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.293 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.661 position:27% line:89% align:start
If you insist...

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:30.231 position:19% line:89% align:start
Meet in the courtyard.

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:32.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
In the courtyard?

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
You talking about
the one sandwiched

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.503 position:24% line:83% align:start
between the women's
and men's prisons?

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:36.871 position:16% line:89% align:start
Exactly. That's the one.

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.906 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you can meet us there
in 20 minutes,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.708 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think I have an idea.

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.778 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait, get there
in twenty minutes?

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.645 position:30% line:89% align:start
From right now?

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.080 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes. It's urgent, isn't it?

00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:49.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you want us
to collect the disc,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.986 position:33% line:83% align:start
we will do so
with the utmost effort.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.722 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you say he'll be revived,
then we believe you.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.324 position:38% line:89% align:start
However,

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.425 position:24% line:83% align:start
you must understand
that we're an unarmed

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.864 position:33% line:83% align:start
As a result,
the Speedwagon Foundation

00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:04.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
cannot help you escape
from the prison

00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
or protect you from any harm.

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.704 position:7% line:83% align:start
Still willing to take the risk
and come to the courtyard?

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:12.139 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'll go.

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:15.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
So... how exactly
do I get it to you?

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:18.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
We shouldn't discuss
that matter over the phone.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
All I can say is,

00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:22.183 position:30% line:83% align:start
please look for
"Savage Guardian."

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:24.518 position:19% line:89% align:start
It'll make sense there.

00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:28.455 position:19% line:83% align:start
How about we call this
"Operation Savage Guardian"?

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.697 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is that a thing? Or a person?

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:39.600 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whatever. I'll figure it out.

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.135 position:33% line:83% align:start
I gotta head
to the courtyard.

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:44.305 position:13% line:89% align:start
From floor one's cafeteria,

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:45.907 position:30% line:83% align:start
in order to get
to the courtyard,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.109 position:24% line:83% align:start
first I have to go
through that gate,

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
then walk upstairs
in the back.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:52.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
And finally, cross over
the connecting corridor

00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:54.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
on the second floor

Huh?

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.197 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hm? [grunts]

[music intensifies]

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Jolyne!

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Emporio.
-Here!

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:22.009 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't touch the baseball.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.548 position:38% line:89% align:start
[silence]

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.284 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I can't let anyone see me.

00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:31.419 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:34.956 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:36.891 position:21% line:89% align:start
[mechanical rumbling]

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.705 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Emporio,
who are those guys?

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.441 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, don't worry.
They're not enemies.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.775 position:7% line:83% align:start
He'd prefer to sleep in a bed,
of course,

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.177 position:13% line:89% align:start
but unfortunately for him,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.446 position:19% line:83% align:start
there simply isn't one
to be found in this room.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.414 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, naturally,
he's got no other choice

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:01.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
but to sleep
in the grand piano.

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:07.688 position:33% line:89% align:start
[door opens]

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.858 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Jolyne.

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.127 position:13% line:83% align:start
This spot is the ghost room
I call home.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the place where I live.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:16.998 position:21% line:89% align:start
A ghost room? Wait...

00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:20.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Are you a ghost?
-Of course not, Jolyne.

00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:21.535 position:16% line:89% align:start
Neither of us are ghosts.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:23.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
We're both
actual living humans.

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:24.772 position:19% line:89% align:start
Go ahead and touch me!

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:26.774 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have a body temperature
and a pulse.

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:28.576 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen carefully.

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:31.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not like this room
is inhabited by a ghost.

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.280 position:10% line:89% align:start
Rather, the room is a ghost.

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:35.850 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:38.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you understand if
I say they're ghost objects?

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.856 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Green Dolphin Street Prison
caught fire in 1984

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then underwent
a huge renovation.

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:45.659 position:19% line:83% align:start
This room was one part
of the prison

00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:47.828 position:10% line:89% align:start
which completely burned down.

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:49.930 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're inside
"objects of the past."

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:52.133 position:33% line:83% align:start
The ghost of
the music room itself.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:54.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Wait, so...

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
Emporio, wouldn't this mean
that you're a...

00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:58.239 position:27% line:89% align:start
that you are a...

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.441 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was born like this,

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:03.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the ability
to use these ghost objects.

00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:05.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
Interacting with them
is my Stand power.

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:06.547 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
Although, they're
the only things I can use.

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:10.785 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, for example,

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:13.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
even this chocolate bar
and Florida orange juice...

00:09:15.423 --> 00:09:16.424 position:35% line:89% align:start
[splashes]

00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:18.492 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't actually
eat either of them.

00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:21.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can taste them, though.
They're pretty good.

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:23.164 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.435 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps] The heck?

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.437 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Don't worry, Jolyne.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
That little clock got stopped
when the prison was burnt down.

00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:36.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
There is still time until
that meeting in 20 minutes.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.144 position:35% line:89% align:start
However...

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:39.647 position:13% line:89% align:start
You discussing how to sneak

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.582 position:13% line:83% align:start
the disc out of the prison
over the phone.

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:43.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
How could you be so dumb?

00:09:43.552 --> 00:09:45.986 position:16% line:83% align:start
I understand that you're
in a difficult situation,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.588 position:30% line:83% align:start
but Pale Snake
is definitely going to

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.023 position:10% line:89% align:start
learn about your scheme now.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:51.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then please, Emporio...

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:52.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need you to tell me
a shortcut

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:53.961 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get me to the courtyard.

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:55.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't misunderstand me,
Jolyne.

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:58.065 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's not as if this ghost room
is connected everywhere,

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
all throughout
the prison complex.

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:01.435 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm just employing
the ghost items,

00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:02.803 position:30% line:83% align:start
which I can use
my Stand power

00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.573 position:16% line:83% align:start
to interact with in order
to move around

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:06.974 position:19% line:83% align:start
without getting caught,
like this. See?

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:09.844 position:33% line:83% align:start
Nonetheless,
I know we have to do this.

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.745 position:21% line:83% align:start
He wants to tag along
with you.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.917 position:7% line:83% align:start
It'd be a good idea to let him.
He'll be a great help.

00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:20.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
I forgot to mention.
His name is Weather Forecast.

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:24.892 position:38% line:89% align:start
[rumble]

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.396 position:33% line:83% align:start
So this is...
the present day music room?

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:33.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can let your guard down
with Weather Forecast.

00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:35.570 position:30% line:83% align:start
The reason why
he doesn't talk much

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.506 position:35% line:83% align:start
is because
he lost his memories.

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:38.405 position:38% line:89% align:start
Memories?

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:41.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
He doesn't have any memory
of his childhood

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
or even how he ended up
inside of the prison.

00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:46.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
But he has to serve
a sentence of six years.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.182 position:19% line:89% align:start
He likes to stretch out

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.283 position:21% line:89% align:start
and walk on his toes.

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:52.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
He loves reading TV guides,
but he doesn't watch TV.

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:53.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whenever he does speak,

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
he doesn't open
his mouth very wide,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.225 position:16% line:83% align:start
so he tends to talk right
in front of your face.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:00.595 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, and nose breath is warm.

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:03.097 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, so does this mean
Pale Snake

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
stole Weather Forecast's
memories?

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.535 position:38% line:89% align:start
Probably.

00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:09.837 position:10% line:83% align:start
So because of this, he wants
to find out who he really is.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
Also, Weather Forecast wants
to help figure out

00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:15.042 position:10% line:83% align:start
why your father's memory disc
was stolen from him.

00:11:16.677 --> 00:11:18.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
[whispers] My Stand isn't
from a disc.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.114 position:35% line:89% align:start
He said...

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
He isn't the sort
of Stand User

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
who has been created
with a disc,

00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:25.052 position:27% line:89% align:start
so it sounds like

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:27.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
Weather Forecast
was born a Stand User.

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:29.223 position:33% line:89% align:start
His power...

[bubbles, thunders]

weather phenomena.

00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:38.199 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's named...

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
Weather Forecast!

00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:47.908 position:44% line:89% align:start

you didn't notice. Pretend.

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:11.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, seems someone
was surprised

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
by the sound and
looked inside of the room.

00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:17.838 position:13% line:89% align:start
I was able to confirm this.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.541 position:21% line:83% align:start
It would appear that
there's somebody

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:21.643 position:38% line:83% align:start
who knows
you're making a move,

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:23.410 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they've come here
to check up on you.

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:24.713 position:38% line:89% align:start
And now,

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.981 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've seen the enemy's face.

Oh, shit.

I had no idea he was already
this close to us all.

00:12:50.672 --> 00:12:51.939 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if that guy is
a Stand User,

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.107 position:16% line:89% align:start
then we're going to have

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
to take care of it
right now this instant!

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't do it, Jolyne!
It's better to hide from him.

00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:58.379 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
Keep on running!

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:00.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
He doesn't know that
you're trying

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:02.383 position:27% line:83% align:start
to make your way
to the courtyard!

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:04.519 position:30% line:83% align:start
Think about it.
He only came to find us

00:13:04.552 --> 00:13:05.654 position:16% line:89% align:start
because he must not know

00:13:05.687 --> 00:13:07.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
what you talked about
on the phone!

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:08.322 position:30% line:83% align:start
If he knew what
your plan was,

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
then he would have headed
directly to the courtyard.

00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:13.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why he's chasing
after us right now

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:15.062 position:27% line:83% align:start

Who... who the hell
is that freak?

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:22.737 position:10% line:89% align:start
We've gotta turn that corner!

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.572 position:41% line:83% align:start
Hurry!
Before he catches up to us!

[tense music playing]

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:44.958 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] I was correct.

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:48.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
Apparently, hiding
was a really good idea.

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
That weird man doesn't seem
to have any clue

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:52.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
about where it is
you're heading to.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.935 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what the hell was going
on with that guy, anyways?

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.304 position:30% line:83% align:start
The way he ran
on all fours was so strange.

00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:58.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
We were pretty lucky.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.308 position:10% line:83% align:start
Good thing the dude was still
slower than us regardless.

00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:02.009 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hm, still.

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:03.210 position:10% line:89% align:start
You should make your way over

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:05.479 position:27% line:83% align:start
to that courtyard
as soon as you possibly can.

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:07.816 position:19% line:83% align:start
The phone call you made
to the Speedwagon Foundation

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.283 position:16% line:89% align:start
was definitely recorded,

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:10.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I get the feeling
Pale Snake

00:14:10.785 --> 00:14:11.985 position:7% line:89% align:start
hasn't actually heard that yet.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.388 position:30% line:83% align:start
Quicker you go,
less dangerous it'll be.

00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:17.424 position:13% line:89% align:start
Medical wing's over there.

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:19.460 position:19% line:83% align:start
Once you make your way
past the medical wing,

00:14:19.493 --> 00:14:22.096 position:7% line:83% align:start
there's a gate for the corridor
around the corner.

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.665 position:10% line:89% align:start
It leads towards the factory,

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:24.965 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then to the men's prison

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
across the courtyard
you're trying to reach.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
Both the men and
the women prisoners

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.970 position:10% line:89% align:start
can access the medical wing.

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:30.739 position:7% line:83% align:start
And given that Weather Forecast
is a guy,

00:14:30.772 --> 00:14:32.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
[theme song playing]

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:34.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
if he tells the guards
on duty that

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.309 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's going back to
the men's prison,

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:37.111 position:16% line:83% align:start
then he can definitely go
to the factory entrance

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:38.212 position:21% line:89% align:start
through the corridor.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.214 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or at least
that's what he said to me.

00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:41.448 position:35% line:89% align:start
You first.

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:43.016 position:16% line:89% align:start
Okay, sounds like a plan.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.452 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I'd just need
to bribe the guards, right?

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:46.420 position:24% line:89% align:start
Fifty bucks enough?

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sure, but tell them
that you need

00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:49.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
to repair your boots
at the factory.

00:14:49.858 --> 00:14:51.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
No matter what, though,

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:52.827 position:13% line:89% align:start
even if you were able to go

00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:54.428 position:16% line:83% align:start
through the medical wing
of the prison,

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.964 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll have to get
into the courtyard by force.

00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:58.566 position:24% line:89% align:start
Security is light,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.535 position:19% line:83% align:start
but if you get caught,
they can shoot at you.

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:03.772 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'll get yourself another
five years for prison-breaking.

00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:06.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
You think I have
to force my way in?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
Guess I'll just have
to roll with it.

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:10.411 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have no choice.

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:12.614 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, what's an additional
five years

00:15:12.647 --> 00:15:13.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
to my prison sentence?

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:15.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's essentially nothing,
you know?

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.751 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thanks for all
your help, Emporio.

00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:17.652 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sure...

00:15:18.653 --> 00:15:19.920 position:19% line:89% align:start
but I can't go further.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:21.656 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, revive him.

00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:25.693 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want your father
to come back to life,

00:15:25.727 --> 00:15:27.094 position:19% line:89% align:start
back to consciousness.

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
Because if he does so,

00:15:28.863 --> 00:15:30.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I think we can
start to see

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.533 position:33% line:83% align:start
some hope in
our world again.

get me a new one now, inmate.

00:15:50.317 --> 00:15:52.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
As if. No way I'd touch that.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only thing I touched
was your little saucer plate.

Hm...

It's a bit of a safety hazard.

So I'd really like to get it
repaired at the factory.

in your cup for you?

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:06.614 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't go any further away
from me!

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:09.017 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can you hear me?
I'm being attacked again!

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.518 position:10% line:89% align:start
[muffled] He stole the disc!

00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:13.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we can't catch him here,
everything is over!

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.422 position:16% line:89% align:start
Everything will end here.

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:17.457 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't let him go!

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:19.727 position:44% line:89% align:start
No...

00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:21.729 position:13% line:89% align:start
My voice doesn't reach him.

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.369 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:29.403 --> 00:19:32.540 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ugh, somebody got in the way.

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:34.676 position:10% line:83% align:start
And here I was thinking that
I was only going to have

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
to kill that woman,
Jolyne Cujoh.

00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:37.945 position:38% line:89% align:start
[buzzing]

[whirring]

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:42.784 position:35% line:83% align:start
Prepare for
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:45.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
Weather Forecast, listen!

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
His Stand power is
gravity removal!

00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:50.357 position:16% line:83% align:start
And don't touch whatever
it is he shoots at you.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
Try to dodge it, or else
you'll become weightless!

00:19:52.894 --> 00:19:55.462 position:10% line:89% align:start
[whirring] Zero-gravity zone.

00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:57.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you truly are
a Stand User,

00:19:57.565 --> 00:20:00.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
then you should be fully aware
what it is this means.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:02.904 position:30% line:83% align:start
So do you think
you can you figure that out?

00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.773 position:19% line:89% align:start
[whirring intensifies]

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.143 position:41% line:89% align:start
[crash]

00:20:09.177 --> 00:20:11.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
What you've just thrown
at me...

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.380 position:35% line:83% align:start
looks like
a piece of garbage.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:17.217 position:13% line:89% align:start
This Weather Forecast guy.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.087 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's apparently very powerful,

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.922 position:13% line:83% align:start
but his ability to control
the weather

00:20:20.955 --> 00:20:22.422 position:16% line:89% align:start
is still a mystery to me.

00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:25.193 position:10% line:83% align:start
That cloud cover he summoned
is probably working

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.861 position:16% line:89% align:start
as an atmospheric layer.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:28.196 position:16% line:89% align:start
He simply reflected away

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
our enemy's attack with
that resistance.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that man's arm spin
has centrifugal force!

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since it's weightless,
it can accelerate forever

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.005 position:16% line:89% align:start
with that spinning force.

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:39.073 position:27% line:89% align:start
Which would mean,

00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:41.175 position:30% line:83% align:start
since the core
of his body stays still,

00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:43.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
he can accurately aim
with strong power!

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:49.217 position:24% line:89% align:start
Jumpin' Jack Spark!

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.318 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! Weather Forecast!

Fire? Where did this fire
come from?

00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:58.192 position:16% line:89% align:start
Air resistance friction?

00:20:58.226 --> 00:20:59.493 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is seriously not good.

00:20:59.527 --> 00:21:01.294 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's spreading all over
my body now!

00:21:01.328 --> 00:21:02.597 position:16% line:89% align:start
Release the zero gravity!

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
[squelches]

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is the end for you!

[woman over speaker]
The abnormality alarm

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:12.039 position:24% line:83% align:start
has been activated
in hallway 7B.

00:21:12.073 --> 00:21:13.373 position:38% line:83% align:start
I repeat.
The abnormality alarm...

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:16.376 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, shit.
Must've been the impact.

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:18.411 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've retrieved the damned disc
and yet...

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
The gate is closing!
What should I do?

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:24.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's getting even harder
to go to the courtyard now.

00:21:24.118 --> 00:21:25.553 position:10% line:89% align:start
But we have no other choice!

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
The enemy will be trapped
in here too.

00:21:27.588 --> 00:21:29.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's my chance to get
the disc!

Everything that you touch,
if I'm right...

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
It becomes weightless.
Am I correct...

Still, though...

00:22:13.801 --> 00:22:16.270 position:33% line:83% align:start
Where is that
anti-gravity wielding thief?

00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:18.506 position:10% line:89% align:start
I need to get the disc back.
