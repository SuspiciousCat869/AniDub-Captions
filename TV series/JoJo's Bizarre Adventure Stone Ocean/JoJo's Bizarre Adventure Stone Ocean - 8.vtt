[Ermes] Don't act like
you're innocent.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.193 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm talking about the one
that killed that guard

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.962 position:19% line:89% align:start
and tried to drown us!

to figure out which

one of you bitches
is the impostor,

Are you serious? Psycho.

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:37.005 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know you heard me,
you dumb bitch!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.506 position:13% line:89% align:start
And if I recall correctly,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
didn't the chica
who blew up say something

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.910 position:27% line:83% align:start
about not knowing
who you were?

[Ermes] You two,
can you back that up?

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
Do you remember seeing her

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.115 position:30% line:83% align:start
when we formed
this search party?

We don't remember
who you are either.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, you do know that
I was with you all

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.290 position:16% line:89% align:start
from the jump, don't you?

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:57.825 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry to say this,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.527 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I can't say
that I remember you.

Shut it! Nobody knows who
your scrawny ass is either!

Yes you do!

I'm the one who just
called for help on the radio.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe you only did that
to trick us.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.070 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute.
You there, with the black hair.

Why did your nose
just start bleeding?

I couldn't see
all that well, but Ermes...

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:21.248 position:7% line:83% align:start
when I punched the enemy Stand
in the face,

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
one of these three
stumbled a bit.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.453 position:24% line:89% align:start
Get back right now!

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.990 position:16% line:89% align:start
Stay away from the water!

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:30.725 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, you've got it all wrong!

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:31.559 position:21% line:89% align:start
My nose is bleeding,

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:33.061 position:16% line:83% align:start
'cause that bitch hit me
in the face

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.662 position:21% line:89% align:start
when she grabbed me!

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:36.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
See, look! Her bloody hand.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.765 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's proof that she did it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

[annoyed grunt]
Are you for real?

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:43.004 position:27% line:89% align:start
I didn't hit her.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:44.706 position:19% line:83% align:start
My finger just scraped
her teeth.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was most definitely here
from the start.

If anyone's the killer,
it's gotta be one of you!

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:50.945 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah!

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.145 position:13% line:89% align:start
Remember what happened when

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.581 position:19% line:83% align:start
the chief was chatting
with his gator?

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:55.482 position:24% line:83% align:start
You were over there
talking mad shit!

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.317 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ain't that right,
little miss bitch?

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.086 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.252 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.589 position:30% line:83% align:start

seem pretty suspicious too!

It's true!
So the black hair did do it.

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:13.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
But how the hell
did you figure out it was her?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, to tell the truth,

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.639 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have no idea
if it actually was her.

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:20.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why, I'm just gonna
knock out all three of you!

do you think you are?

Now my plan's ruined.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:34.622 position:35% line:83% align:start
I wanted to
kill you separately.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:36.223 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was gonna get you
into the water

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.258 position:19% line:89% align:start
and tear you to shreds.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
[in demonic voice] But your
little trick surprised me.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:41.529 position:21% line:89% align:start
I really didn't think

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.230 position:33% line:83% align:start
you could get
out of that situation,

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.533 position:7% line:83% align:start
but that thread power of yours
is a pain in the ass.

Wha-- what the hell
is going on with them?!

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.404 position:7% line:83% align:start
It can't be all three of them,
can it?

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.541 position:10% line:83% align:start
This doesn't make any sense.

were actually here

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:15.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
from the very beginning

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:18.733 position:10% line:83% align:start
were the ones with the black
hair and the shaved head.

They decided to go
near the tractor,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.744 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I decided to kill them and

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
take over their bodies
and intellect.

On the other hand,
thNis body of mine is...

[both grunt nervously]

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.385 position:27% line:83% align:start

from the scraps of flesh
left over

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.856 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the missing prisoners!

That strange black goop

My once divided body
is now whole again.

If it is to protect
the "power" and "memory"

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
that Pale Snake's discs most
graciously bestowed upon me,

I am willing to do
anything it takes.

To repay the great debt
I owe him,

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.419 position:30% line:83% align:start
it's my mission
to get rid of anyone

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:54.622 position:16% line:83% align:start
who approaches the discs
in the storehouse.

Damn it!

Where the fuck is
the actual Stand User hiding?

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:00.261 position:24% line:89% align:start
Think again, Ermes.

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:01.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
The User is...

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.030 position:24% line:89% align:start
that thing itself!

00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:03.831 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:05.032 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's alive.

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:09.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
See, this thing is a living
organism born in the water,

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:11.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
and from the discs,
it gained power.

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:12.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
And the one guarding
those discs

00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.642 position:30% line:83% align:start
was never human
to begin with.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.510 position:19% line:89% align:start
A... a living organism?

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:17.745 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you talking about

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:20.848 position:30% line:83% align:start
all those tiny
killer plankton things?

00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:22.415 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Since the storehouse
doesn't have

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
a constant supply of water,

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.020 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's probably moving
by consuming water

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:29.857 position:7% line:83% align:start
from the bodies of its victims
in order to protect the discs.

00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:32.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
It exists on land
by multiplying itself.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.493 position:21% line:89% align:start
But there's a catch.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:35.630 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just like gas for a car,
it needs to

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:37.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
to replenish its water
when it runs out.

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.301 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we want to get the discs
back from this creature,

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:41.602 position:21% line:89% align:start
we have to make sure

00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
it doesn't get close
to the water,

A famous astronomer
by the name of

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.555 position:13% line:89% align:start

"It is wrong to assume,

that living organisms were

on this Earth."

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:11.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
"The power of intellect

a pre-existing force
in this universe,

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:15.369 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it is that intellect

To put it another way,

it can be said intellect
preceded even the Big Bang,

let me get this straight.

00:18:05.887 --> 00:18:07.055 position:33% line:83% align:start
When you say
"live in her body",

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.255 position:30% line:83% align:start
does that mean
you're planning

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:11.025 position:16% line:83% align:start
to go back to the prison
pretending to be her?

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:14.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, my new mission
is to protect you.

00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:15.228 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:17.031 position:21% line:89% align:start
And it's no big deal.

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:18.766 position:33% line:83% align:start
I have access
to all of her memories.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's Atroe, and her
prisoner number is FE39423.

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:25.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
Back when she was just
a little kid,

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:27.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
she always dreamed
of being kidnapped.

00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:29.409 position:19% line:89% align:start
So... when she grew up,

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:32.312 position:21% line:83% align:start
she kidnapped a child
the way she wanted to be.

00:18:32.346 --> 00:18:34.949 position:21% line:83% align:start
She didn't even do it
for ransom money or anything.

00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:36.517 position:16% line:89% align:start
She sort of just did it.

00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:39.921 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh hey, it looks like both
of your arms are bleeding.

-[exhales]
-[exhales]

00:18:42.857 --> 00:18:44.124 position:27% line:89% align:start
So does it hurt?

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:46.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
I really wish I could
heal you, but I can't.

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.162 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[slurping]
-[both gasp]

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:50.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
Get your tongue off of me,
you freak!

00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:52.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing?
Don't lick us!

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:56.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
[gasps] It's water!
Tasty water!

00:18:56.571 --> 00:18:57.939 position:35% line:89% align:start
[slurping]

00:18:57.972 --> 00:19:00.041 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, you sure ain't human.

00:19:00.074 --> 00:19:01.241 position:16% line:89% align:start
Before you go to prison,

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:03.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
there're some things
you gotta learn.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.679 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd say drinking with a cup

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:07.015 position:38% line:83% align:start
would be
a pretty good place to start.

00:19:07.048 --> 00:19:08.049 position:41% line:89% align:start
A cup?

00:19:08.082 --> 00:19:10.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you say so?
That's easy!

00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:13.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
Drinking water out of a cup
is nothing!

00:19:13.087 --> 00:19:14.522 position:27% line:89% align:start
[disgusted groan]

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:16.958 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
about what I said earlier.

00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:18.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wanna ask you more
about Pale Snake.

00:19:18.893 --> 00:19:21.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do they make a habit of
coming out to this storehouse?

00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:22.764 position:16% line:89% align:start
[refreshed exhale] Nope.

00:19:22.797 --> 00:19:24.966 position:21% line:83% align:start
They rarely, if ever,
come near the tractor,

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.035 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I've never seen
the User either.

00:19:27.068 --> 00:19:28.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
The pile of discs here

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.838 position:33% line:83% align:start
are the ones
that Pale Snake doesn't need.

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:32.172 position:33% line:83% align:start
You probably
know this already,

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:33.741 position:33% line:83% align:start
but no matter
how strong a Stand is,

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:35.275 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you don't have
the constitution for it,

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:36.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
it'll reject you.

00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:38.579 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's why
this is the junk pile.

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:40.782 position:38% line:83% align:start
To them,
they're completely useless.

00:19:41.683 --> 00:19:43.618 position:16% line:83% align:start
The important discs with
all the memories

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:45.720 position:30% line:83% align:start
must be stored
somewhere else.

00:19:45.753 --> 00:19:47.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why you won't
be able to find

00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:49.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
the memory disc
you're looking for.

00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:50.525 position:24% line:89% align:start
[speechless breath]

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:52.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
The thing Pale Snake
wanted to steal

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
from your father
wasn't his ultimate Stand,

00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:57.165 position:19% line:83% align:start
but most likely, it was
the memories inside his head.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know what
he has in there,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.268 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it's gotta be
a really important secret.

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:02.704 position:35% line:89% align:start
A secret...

00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:03.571 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sirens blaring]

00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:06.574 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:08.776 position:13% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] The guards are here.

00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:11.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's the plan, Jolyne?

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:14.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
What are you gonna do
with Star Platinum's disc?

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:16.884 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, before
I can do anything else,

00:20:16.918 --> 00:20:17.785 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've gotta figure out

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:19.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
how to get the disc
out of this prison

00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:23.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
and to the foundation
that's sheltering my father.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.292 position:10% line:89% align:start
If we don't revive him soon,

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:28.129 position:24% line:83% align:start
his body will begin
to deteriorate.

00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:30.732 position:13% line:83% align:start
Eventually, I'll take back
his memory disc,

00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:32.533 position:16% line:89% align:start
no matter what it takes.

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:34.969 position:38% line:83% align:start
You wanna
get it out of prison, huh?

00:20:35.002 --> 00:20:36.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's gonna be
a lot harder

00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:37.939 position:27% line:83% align:start
than if you were
bringing something in.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
And when the guards get here,

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:42.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
they're definitely gonna
inspect us from head to toe.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
Give the disc to me.

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:50.283 position:13% line:83% align:start
[muffled] All I gotta do is
bump my boobs a few cup sizes.

00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:54.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
There!

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:56.657 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sirens ringing]

00:20:57.992 --> 00:20:59.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
F.F., raise your hands
in the air

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:00.895 position:10% line:89% align:start
so that they won't shoot you.

00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:01.829 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ermes,

00:21:01.863 --> 00:21:03.798 position:33% line:89% align:start
same for you.

00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:07.502 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our story is that an alligator
viciously attacked the guard,

00:21:07.535 --> 00:21:09.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
and it was us who saved him.

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:12.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, we don't know
about the other prisoners.

00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:14.175 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just follow my lead, okay?

[Pale Snake] She played
her role as bait well.

Jotaro's daughter was
only meant to lure him in.

00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:38.365 position:30% line:83% align:start
I never thought
she'd become someone

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:40.268 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd need to worry about.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.803 position:33% line:89% align:start
Jolyne Cujoh.

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:44.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is it possible she defeated
that incompetent guard

00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:46.674 position:27% line:83% align:start
and took the disc
all by herself?

00:21:46.707 --> 00:21:48.876 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps,
these other two prisoners

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
who survived were there
to lend Jolyne a helping hand

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.581 position:19% line:89% align:start
in thwarting my plans.

that worried about

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:08.062 position:33% line:83% align:start
the prisoners
that went missing?

A while longer.

After all, I am on
