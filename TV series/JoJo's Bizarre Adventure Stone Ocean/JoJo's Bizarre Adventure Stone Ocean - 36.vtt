that's giving him
the advantage?

Good afternoon, everyone.

The accident on State Highway

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:28.296 position:5% line:89% align:start
with casualty numbers estimated

to be between
one and two thousand,

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:32.633 position:19% line:83% align:start
was initially thought
to be caused by a collapse.

since military vehicles

were blown away or whatever.

Yo! Did no one else
see anything like that?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.496 position:7% line:83% align:start
My guess is that we were moved
by the reversed gravity.

Good theory, but not likely.

already worn off back there.

And besides,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.206 position:33% line:83% align:start

So I'd like to ask you
for your blessing

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.618 position:16% line:89% align:start
to marry your daughter.

00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:50.491 position:7% line:83% align:start

Please, Mr. Jotaro.

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:53.595 position:33% line:83% align:start

I want to marry your daughter.

[hopeful music]

00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:58.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know now is not
the best time,

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:01.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
but all you have to do
is give me your permission.

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:04.438 position:33% line:83% align:start
If I may...
have her father's approval,

00:15:04.471 --> 00:15:06.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
it'd mean more to me
than you'll ever know.

00:15:08.242 --> 00:15:10.177 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't expect it to be easy,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
and it's not like
I've always felt

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:13.981 position:7% line:89% align:start
worthy enough to marry Jolyne.

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:16.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
And sure, I have been branded
a murderer,

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.152 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I'm well aware
that there's no way

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.954 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jolyne would fall in love
with me right away.

00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:23.825 position:10% line:83% align:start
But, the sheer determination
and pure soul

00:15:23.858 --> 00:15:26.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
which Jolyne inherited
from you, her father,

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.631 position:7% line:83% align:start
is the light that shines upon
the darkest part of my heart.

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it's that heart that
could collapse at any moment.

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:36.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
She is exactly what I need.

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.573 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.675 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please, sir.

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:43.310 position:38% line:83% align:start

is all I need to hear.

marry her

And we're fine for now,

but... who knows
if this will even work?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
And since he was able
to complete his ability,

00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:28.222 position:13% line:83% align:start
he's not just gonna let us

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:30.725 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, he wants

'Cause he knows

to fight against that?

It may seem like we've
been cornered up here,

00:16:59.954 --> 00:17:01.756 position:16% line:83% align:start
but getting on the roof
was the right decision.

00:17:02.957 --> 00:17:05.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
His new ability
is to speed up time,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
and he's the only person
who can move through it.

00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:10.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it doesn't mean
that we can't see him at all.

00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:12.466 position:19% line:83% align:start
According to the speed
at which

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
the hands of my watch
are moving,

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:17.104 position:10% line:83% align:start
the minute hand indicates
that it takes about two minus

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.273 position:13% line:89% align:start
for a full hour to go by.

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:22.242 position:5% line:83% align:start
In other words, someone running
at 10 kilometers per hour

00:17:22.276 --> 00:17:23.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
would seem to us as
if they were running

00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:25.547 position:27% line:83% align:start
at the same speed
as a bullet train.

00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:30.484 position:7% line:83% align:start
However, we are still able to
see an approaching bullet train

00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:31.351 position:21% line:89% align:start
with our naked eyes.

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:33.855 position:19% line:89% align:start
Stay calm and observe.

00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:36.189 position:7% line:89% align:start
We can at least see his moves.

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.158 position:33% line:83% align:start
Try to sense
where he's going next.

00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:40.427 position:24% line:89% align:start
But that's so fast.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
That means if a car is going
60 kilometers per hour,

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.966 position:13% line:89% align:start
it would feel like 1,800.

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:47.835 position:13% line:89% align:start
And 100 would be Mach 2.4.

00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:49.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jotaro] Exactly.
But lucky for us,

00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:51.873 position:7% line:83% align:start
the priest is still reluctant
to climb up here

and join us on this roof.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:55.810 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's being cautious
because of me

00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:59.079 position:10% line:83% align:start
and my ability to stop time
for several seconds.

that none of us know...

How will his ability evolve
from this point on?

You just used your Stand...

00:19:52.827 --> 00:19:55.195 position:19% line:83% align:start
and dove into my body
at the last second.

[coughs]

00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:57.932 position:27% line:89% align:start
In that moment,

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
you let your Stand
take the brunt of the attack.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:03.370 position:10% line:83% align:start
all so that I wouldn't have
to suffer a fatal wound.

[Jotaro] It's still too short.

00:20:22.657 --> 00:20:25.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stopping time for just
five seconds isn't enough.

00:20:25.727 --> 00:20:28.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm not able
to stop time consecutively!

00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:32.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
After I stopped time for five
seconds using Star Platinum,

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:34.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have to take a moment
to catch my breath.

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:37.972 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's the only way that I can
stop time again so soon.

stand up to him is me

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.378 position:30% line:83% align:start
when he's in
a close-enough range.

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only chance I've got
to take him out

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.349 position:33% line:83% align:start
is right now

the one who'll be
the first in line to die

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:20.181 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be Anastasia instead,

00:21:20.214 --> 00:21:22.250 position:27% line:89% align:start
and not Jotaro.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.651 position:24% line:89% align:start
But you know what?

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:25.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
Although it's something so vast

00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:27.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
you will not be able
to fathom it,

00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:29.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll make this clear
once and for all.

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:31.726 position:13% line:89% align:start
Time will keep racing by.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.662 position:10% line:89% align:start
But, for your clarification,

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:36.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
I did not obtain this ability

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:38.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
just so I can dispose
of you all,

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:40.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
nor did I do it
to become the most powerful.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
The true purpose of
this ability

00:21:45.273 --> 00:21:46.674 position:19% line:83% align:start
is to guide the masses
of humanity
