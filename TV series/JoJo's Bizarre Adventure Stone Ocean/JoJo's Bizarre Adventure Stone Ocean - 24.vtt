[Jolyne] I know
I need something, but what?

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.575 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's important? What's
something I cannot forget?

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.810 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have something important
to tell Jolyne.

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:44.311 position:30% line:83% align:start
I got to go.
She needs me!

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
[man] Wait a minute!
What the hell was I doing?

Why would he go

Take the remote from her!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.809 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know what the fuck
is happening anymore.

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.511 position:19% line:83% align:start
And drag her dumb ass
out of here!

[Jolyne] Huh?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.847 position:7% line:83% align:start
Fine! I won't watch it, then.

man. Hope we can get along!

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.527 position:10% line:89% align:start
They call me Ron the Viper.

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:37.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh... yeah, of course!
Appreciate it!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
And that spider over there is
on the brink of death.

00:01:40.068 --> 00:01:41.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, what's up, bro?

supposed to be funny?

I don't get it at all.

Uh, where am I?
The rec room?

00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:54.414 position:7% line:83% align:start
I must have had a good reason
to come in here.

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:01.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Oh, yeah.
I have to go see Emporio.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.957 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm here to find another way

00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:04.792 position:10% line:83% align:start

somehow.

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:14.068 position:30% line:83% align:start
Emporio's room
is off that staircase.

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:16.203 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's usually
a walk in the park,

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.372 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they've beefed up
security today.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
So how do I get to Emporio
in one piece?

Shit! It's a Stand.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.400 position:24% line:83% align:start

I've seen it before.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.936 position:35% line:83% align:start
The enemy!
I've got to go after it.

two guards there a second ago.

Who cares?
Doesn't matter right now.

how did I even get here?

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.372 position:13% line:89% align:start

Find her!
Go, move your ass!

There's no way
she just disappeared.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's got to be hiding
somewhere close by.

00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
[guard 2] Maybe she ran
towards the stairwell.

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:10.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
[guard 3] Not a chance!
She would have had to

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
pass right by us.
We'd have seen her.

Oh, yeah! I spilled the water
and it went everywhere.

There's something
I need to tell Jolyne.

I have to get to her
before it's too late!

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.445 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] But I have to write
somewhere else,

before I forget it all again.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:56.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need to make sure
she sees the mug shot.

Or else, I won't be able

Since you can only retain
up to three memories at a time,

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
even if there are four guards
chasing after you,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll only be able
to remember three of them.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.306 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, your eyes will be
able to see all of them,

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:19.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
totaling more than four,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.176 position:10% line:83% align:start
but your brain will outright
reject them as a memory.

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:28.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
Go see Emporio.

Oh, that's right.

00:08:28.943 --> 00:08:30.544 position:24% line:83% align:start
I came to see you
and it's urgent.

00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:32.747 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I have no idea why.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.783 position:7% line:83% align:start

[Emporio] "Print it out."

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.220 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, I've got to print it out.

[Mew Mew] Oh, I get it.

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.411 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, last time we met,

00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:06.213 position:30% line:83% align:start
that little rat
was there with you, too.

He saw my face and my Stand,
and he heard my name.

That Emporio was inside
the wall in the solitary cell.

Usually, I'd leave him alone.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Mew Mew] Her Stand,
Stone Ocean, is too strong,

00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
so these bullets
will be useless against her.

But I know
you won't remember this.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.683 position:24% line:83% align:start
That if I had shot
four bullets at you,

you would have no clue

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:28.996 position:10% line:83% align:start
even those fervent emotions
will be

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
That'll give them
more of a reason

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.140 position:7% line:89% align:start
to put a bullet in your head.

those big strong arms,

[Mew Mew]
My official, sworn duty

00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:51.458 position:10% line:83% align:start
is really only to make sure
Stand Users get put away.

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:53.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I'm rather excited
you're getting more than that.

00:14:57.164 --> 00:15:00.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Knowing you're about to die
makes me giddy.

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:02.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
If anyone deserves it,
it's you.

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:04.471 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is all because
you refused to behave

00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:05.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
and be a good little doggy.

the fact that you can only see

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.546 position:7% line:89% align:start
three guards in front of you.

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:14.081 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's driving me wild with joy.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
[all yell] She's at

You're never getting past

Hey, Jolyne!

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:27.394 position:19% line:89% align:start
When did you get here?

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.464 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know you! You're Emporio!

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:31.900 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, Jolyne,

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:35.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
you gotta know,
this needs to be printed out,

00:15:35.235 --> 00:15:37.505 position:7% line:83% align:start
or else I was gonna forget it
in no time.

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:39.574 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Print what out?

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:41.008 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] It's in binary code.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
The language only uses
ones and zeros.

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.580 position:7% line:89% align:start
I think I calculated it right.

00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:46.848 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'd be able to print it out

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
how you'd be able
to understand it.

00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:50.050 position:24% line:89% align:start
What I'm saying is

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:52.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
you're the printer
who can memorize it.

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:52.986 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.790 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stone Ocean!

00:15:55.824 --> 00:15:57.692 position:13% line:89% align:start
[uplifting music playing]

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.031 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Binary is universal.

00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:07.201 position:7% line:83% align:start
All things can be represented
with numeric sequencing.

00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:11.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
If your thread can draw the
ones and zeros exactly right,

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
then Stone Ocean
will become the printer

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:14.509 position:5% line:89% align:start
that will express it digitally.

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:23.383 position:19% line:83% align:start

to be the enemy?

Well, are you... my enemy?

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.287 position:44% line:89% align:start

There's no way you can see me.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.964 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, say your last goodbye.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:38.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for that!
You just confirmed it for me,

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:40.735 position:27% line:89% align:start

[woman] What the hell is wrong
with these eggs?

[Father Pucchi] My Stand...

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't the vaguest idea
what it is,

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:11.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it's painfully clear
that it's no longer Pale Snake.

00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:14.709 position:7% line:89% align:start
What is it? What could it be?

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:18.513 position:27% line:89% align:start
I feel terrible.

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:22.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
Something is quickly raging
out of control inside of me.

00:21:22.517 --> 00:21:24.152 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's some kind of
independent power

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:26.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
that's ignoring my will.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.524 position:35% line:83% align:start
But oddly,
I feel hope in this power.

00:21:29.557 --> 00:21:32.660 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hope, in fact, is the one
and only thing I feel from it.

Dio's note recorded
in Jotaro's memories.

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:39.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perhaps that is what I need
to control this power, then.

00:21:40.201 --> 00:21:41.836 position:24% line:89% align:start
The time and place.

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:44.672 position:27% line:83% align:start
North latitude,
28 degrees, 24 minutes.

00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:48.509 position:27% line:83% align:start
West longitude,
80 degrees, 36 minutes.

00:21:48.543 --> 00:21:52.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
Delightful, heaven appears
to be there after all.

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:55.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
And that place
is at Cape Canaveral.

00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kennedy Space Center
to be precise.

The time is the new moon.

Six days from now.
