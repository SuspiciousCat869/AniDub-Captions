I've obtained one disc.
I have it.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
He'll come back to life.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm certain that my father
will definitely regenerate.

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:15.249 position:30% line:83% align:start
[man] How about
we call this

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.986 position:10% line:89% align:start
"Operation Savage Guardian"?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
You ought to let him
tag along.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.188 position:19% line:89% align:start
He'll be a great help.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:25.125 position:21% line:83% align:start
I forgot to mention,
his name is Weather Forecast.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.327 position:10% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Jumpin' Jack Spark!

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.531 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! Weather Forecast!

[gasps]

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:38.940 position:10% line:83% align:start
Still, though, where is that
anti-gravity wielding thief?

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.675 position:10% line:89% align:start
I need to get the disc back!

[female voice]
The abnormality alarm

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.650 position:24% line:83% align:start
has been activated
in hallway 7B.

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
[guard 1] Yes, that's right.
It's passage 7B.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.021 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're currently confirming
the situation.

00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:34.889 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] Did something
unusual happen?

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[guard 2]
We're not certain yet.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, passage 7B
is only meant

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.928 position:27% line:83% align:start
for going to and
from the factory.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:44.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no possibility that
it's a fire or a prisoner riot.

00:02:44.132 --> 00:02:45.298 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no need to worry.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Pucchi] No, I'm not worried.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.336 position:13% line:89% align:start
I maintain the utmost trust

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the Green Dolphin
Street prison

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
and its prisoners.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.808 position:33% line:83% align:start
It was really
just quite noisy,

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.243 position:7% line:83% align:start
so I got unnecessarily curious
and inquired.

00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:57.745 position:35% line:89% align:start
You do know

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
that there hasn't been
even one successful escapee

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.250 position:27% line:83% align:start
from the Aquarium
in the past 20 years, correct?

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
Plus, outside the passageway
is the courtyard.

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
There won't be anyone trying
to escape from this location.

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:09.524 position:24% line:89% align:start
[reassured exhale]

00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:11.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're certainly right
about that.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll handle it.
Thanks, Father.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.829 position:16% line:89% align:start
Right, very well, then...

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.265 position:19% line:89% align:start
[ominous music playing]

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.806 position:30% line:83% align:start
Another quick,
unnecessary question?

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is that clock hanging up
in the corner accurate?

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hm? Yeah, of course, it is.

ROARING

00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:41.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Pucchi] At 11:51,
there was an outgoing call

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.256 position:10% line:89% align:start
to the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:47.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've got my usual ask.

00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:49.831 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to listen
to this recording.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.900 position:30% line:83% align:start
Play the audio
of this one outgoing call.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
From the women's prison
phone stand, number 16.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.472 position:33% line:83% align:start
The call from
about seven minutes ago.

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.842 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, Weather Forecast.

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.544 position:7% line:89% align:start
Since you made contact with me,

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:06.246 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're now also controlled
by zero-gravity.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.286 position:30% line:83% align:start
That weird guy
isn't anywhere to be seen.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.523 position:30% line:83% align:start
We need to get
that disc back quickly!

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:17.525 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't panic.

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:21.195 position:10% line:83% align:start
The thief has to be somewhere
inside this washhouse.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
He must be hiding.

Courtyard's on the other side

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
of that door.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your objective lies
just beyond that doorway.

00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:32.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, the door appears
to be locked.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.108 position:30% line:83% align:start
You might need
to blast it away,

00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:35.710 position:16% line:89% align:start
or force it open somehow.

00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:37.344 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.914 position:35% line:83% align:start
There's...
a little bit of a problem.

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.417 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's sort of hard
to say it out loud.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.453 position:33% line:83% align:start
The thing is,
it's a personal matter.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.355 position:38% line:83% align:start
Although,
I am at a physical limit,

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.590 position:27% line:89% align:start
so I'm troubled.

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:50.925 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um... and...

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't know why it
became a problem so suddenly.

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:56.931 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh... well... but, um...

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
I do think it happens
to everyone sometimes.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:00.902 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.270 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.304 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's like I was saying!

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.807 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's related to
your lower half!

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.941 position:27% line:89% align:start
Begins with "u"!

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:08.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's the biological urge
you have

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
when you're thinking
to yourself,

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:11.779 position:35% line:83% align:start
"Thank god
it isn't number two!"

00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:14.314 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, do you need to take
a piss?

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.883 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't lean in close
to say that.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.786 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's... it's getting
really bad.

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.990 position:19% line:83% align:start
You would have to do it
somewhere over there.

00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:25.560 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, geez,
I never should've asked,

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:27.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
you know, a man, of course.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.131 position:19% line:89% align:start
Already did it myself.

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.066 position:27% line:83% align:start

[gasps]

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Weather Forecast] When you
find yourself in zero-gravity,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
the blood in your body will
suddenly collect at your head.

00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:42.109 position:13% line:83% align:start
That blood is usually down
in the lower parts of the body

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:43.611 position:24% line:89% align:start
because of gravity.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:45.646 position:13% line:83% align:start
Between your skin and bones
is flesh that's squishy

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.015 position:19% line:89% align:start
and swollen with blood.

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:49.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It's called "moon face."
-[gasps]

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:53.554 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, it can be dangerous

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:56.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
when too much blood
goes into your head,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.826 position:21% line:83% align:start
and thus your kidneys
automatically begin working

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
to lessen the amount
of blood in you.

00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:03.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why there's
a severe diuretic effect.

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:06.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
it removes sodium content
through piss,

00:06:06.334 --> 00:06:07.735 position:16% line:89% align:start
and thins out the blood.

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:10.403 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Wait, hang on a second!
-Hey, don't worry.

[grunts in pain]

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:07.028 position:7% line:83% align:start
Everything that I make contact
with enters zero-gravity.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:09.563 position:24% line:89% align:start
I touched the door,

00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:11.065 position:21% line:89% align:start
I touched the floor,

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
and I touched the wall.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.671 position:10% line:83% align:start
That means, this room itself
has become zero-gravity!

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.606 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.444 position:7% line:83% align:start
It'll get pulled by surrounding

[panting]

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.949 position:13% line:83% align:start

Or at this rate,

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:31.552 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll suffocate if
we don't seal them quickly!

is not suffocation,

our blood will boil,

The high speed of
my rotation bullets

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.604 position:10% line:89% align:start
would easily be flicked away

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:31.038 position:16% line:89% align:start
as you defended yourself.

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
I prepared this for
that reason.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
I looked all over
for them everywhere!

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
I captured them and
hid them away.

00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:42.116 position:19% line:89% align:start
There's a lot of them.

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:44.084 position:13% line:89% align:start
Rodents! And they're alive!

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
Could it possibly be?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.154 position:35% line:89% align:start

There we go.

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
I didn't think you would
be able to push

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:01.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
through my zero-gravity power
this much.

00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.404 position:13% line:89% align:start
But you're defenseless now!

00:15:03.437 --> 00:15:06.273 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's over!
Final blow, Jolyne Cujoh!

I'm glad to have gotten
into this prison.

I've obtained
enormous power here.

I'm gonna hand over
the disc to Pale Snake,

and then defeat him too
if I deem it necessary.

00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:43.611 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll do it with my own hands!

Oh, I knew it.

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:02.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was so certain
you would do it.

your screw bullets,

Also, since you don't have
a cloud suit of your own,

00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:43.337 position:19% line:89% align:start
your blood will boil up

That crime I committed,

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:04.391 position:10% line:83% align:start
which got me into this prison
in the first place.

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.194 position:30% line:83% align:start
How many times
did I stab that woman?

00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:09.229 position:33% line:83% align:start
When I killed
my college professor,

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:13.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
the prosecutor said I stabbed
that lady precisely 69 times.

00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:15.937 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is the same feeling
as then.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
I feel it again,
after so long!

Add peroxide

and a chemical reaction occurs,
and oxygen is produced.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
Exactly like the oxygen
in this bottle,

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.789 position:10% line:89% align:start
it keeps on spewing outwards!

that feeling

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.194 position:10% line:83% align:start

With those fresh cuts

I got sent to this prison

If I release the zero-gravity,

00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:08.116 position:16% line:83% align:start
You could've escaped from

On the other side of the door,

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:54.062 position:21% line:89% align:start
there's a passageway.

00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:55.663 position:16% line:89% align:start
Alongside the right wall,

00:19:55.697 --> 00:19:58.331 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are windows that
look out to the courtyard.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:02.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
There, you'll be able to see
a revolving door's gate.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.839 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's the gate
to the courtyard.

During daytime hours,

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:07.809 position:21% line:89% align:start
the gate is unlocked,

00:20:07.842 --> 00:20:09.476 position:21% line:89% align:start
and it's free access.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
But, the problem is...

00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:14.247 position:16% line:83% align:start
how are we going to open
this double door?

00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:16.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I'll have a guard open it up.
-Huh?

00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:18.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have this guy's
work permit card.

00:20:20.054 --> 00:20:21.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll trick them into
opening it.

00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.424 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:25.827 position:30% line:83% align:start
Once they open
this double door,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
you're going to beat up any
and all guards in your path

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:29.964 position:24% line:83% align:start
and force your way
out there, right?

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:32.466 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good plan.

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:35.536 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not only will you have
the crime of attempting escape,

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you'll also be put
in isolation for half a year.

00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:41.843 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'll be left in a small cell
where you can't even exercise.

00:20:42.944 --> 00:20:44.512 position:30% line:89% align:start
Doesn't matter.

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:47.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm going to the courtyard

over to

and only objective.

Sh!

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:04.264 position:24% line:89% align:start
A guard is coming.

00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:07.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, go hide somewhere
over there.

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:09.771 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll go on by myself
from here.

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:11.506 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your wound is horrible.

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:14.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
Also, they could lock
the gate right away

if they see your blood.

I get it. You're right.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.118 position:16% line:89% align:start
[guard] Something wrong?

00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:25.887 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why are you hitting the door?

He said, "It's you."

Rangler, what's wrong?

00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:38.498 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why are you making noise?

00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:40.835 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on.
I'll open the door now.

I'd like to speak with you.

00:21:57.285 --> 00:21:59.419 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? It's not a guard?

Hm?
