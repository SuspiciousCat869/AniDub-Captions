[Dio] Hey, Pucchi,
were you aware

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:15.249 position:10% line:83% align:start
an average of 40,000 people
visit the Louvre per day?

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's the most
sought-out museum on Earth.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
It opened August 10, 1793.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.257 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, this guarantees
that every single day,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.093 position:21% line:83% align:start
before they decide
to leave the museum behind,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.494 position:33% line:83% align:start
40,000 humans
will choose to see

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.496 position:33% line:83% align:start
the Mona Lisa
and Venus de Milo.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fascinating, no?

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.168 position:10% line:83% align:start
When you say "fascinating",
do you mean the numbers?

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.104 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Dio] Let me clarify.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm marveling about
how brilliant artists

00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:40.775 position:13% line:89% align:start
can imbue their very souls

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
into something seen
as merely cold and inanimate.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:47.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
As if they're Stands
that travel beyond time itself.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.482 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Dio] Wouldn't you agree?

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
An intriguing thought, I admit.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, you're implying that
Leonardo Da Vinci

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.658 position:13% line:83% align:start
and Alexandros of Antioch
are Stand Users?

00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.060 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes, I'm talking
about you as well, Pucchi.

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:01.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
Your Pale Snake has the ability

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
to holy manifest souls
and preserve them.

[gasps]

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:09.938 position:13% line:83% align:start
What I'm saying is are you
going to betray me some day?

00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.640 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why haven't you
attacked me yet?

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:14.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
You do know that
my weakness is the sunlight,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.012 position:10% line:83% align:start
which is why I sleep all day
in darkness.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.314 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Dio] You could easily
kill me in my sleep.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you take The World
by turning it into a disc,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
you can be King
almost instantly.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:26.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
Go ahead!

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
[tense music playing]

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.226 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's never crossed my mind
even once before.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have only admiration
for people

00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:38.332 position:10% line:89% align:start
who help nurture my growth.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Young Father Pucchi]
You are the king of kings.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.037 position:30% line:83% align:start
When it's over,
where will you be?

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:44.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to see it through
to the end.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
I love you with the same
reverence and passion

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.209 position:30% line:89% align:start
as I love God.

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Dio] Forgive me, it's quite
obvious now, I've insulted you.

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:10.698 position:27% line:83% align:start
I never imagined
I would one day meet a human

00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:14.669 position:5% line:83% align:start
who could so effortlessly
put me at ease in conversation.

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
You must understand
I was afraid of losing you.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll become a noble priest
one day. I'm certain.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.077 position:30% line:83% align:start
Take that disc,
and do as you will.

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:24.712 position:24% line:89% align:start
A token of apology.

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:27.515 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Dio] I have released it
from my body to you.

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:30.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
No matter where you may be,
you can be secure

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:33.220 position:27% line:83% align:start
in knowing I will
always give you power.

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:40.494 position:30% line:89% align:start

Jolyne!

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.009 position:13% line:89% align:start
Listen to me, Pale Snake.

00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:58.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
Read the memories on that disc

Or can't you hear me?

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:12.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Pale Snake] Why's the radio
randomly sitting here?

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.030 position:19% line:83% align:start
Who's the guy talking?
I need to know.

It's a situation

Five twenty-three.

their past actions.

who I really am.

If I die,

it, too, will certainly
perish forever.

to remove it from my body,

but you must do this.

I want you to use my intellect

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:01.475 position:13% line:83% align:start
and whatever small flicker
remains of my life.

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:03.377 position:27% line:89% align:start
Use everything!

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:06.581 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's all yours now.

00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:08.816 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're going to use that
to reach inside my body

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.220 position:19% line:83% align:start
and take the disc out,
because Jolyne needs it.

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:15.657 position:16% line:83% align:start
Only you, the plankton,
can do this.

00:19:16.423 --> 00:19:20.160 position:16% line:89% align:start
F.F., please, answer me.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.798 position:38% line:83% align:start

You and I made a deal.

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:27.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
That you would hear and obey
all my orders.

I won't let you
break our promise.

You're going to live on.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.341 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't care what you do
to my body.

You have to hurry!

Please, don't worry!

00:19:53.695 --> 00:19:56.064 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's not what you think.

00:19:56.097 --> 00:19:57.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look at the disc.

00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.332 position:24% line:89% align:start
Anastasia did it.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.537 position:19% line:83% align:start

It's back.

F.F., wait! Was that you?

Are you the one
doing the talking?

00:20:09.043 --> 00:20:10.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] I think
what I was most afraid of

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:13.715 position:24% line:83% align:start
was having to leave
my friends behind

without even having any chance
to say goodbye to them.

when the end finally came,

I found the strength
and courage to do it.

What are you telling me?

This is crazy!
I don't believe you!

Jolyne, it's all right!

What you see right now is me!

This is my intellect, my soul.

back from that priest.

No matter what! I promise you!

You'll come back to life
