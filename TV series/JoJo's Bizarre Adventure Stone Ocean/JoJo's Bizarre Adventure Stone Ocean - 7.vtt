00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.042 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Why?

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.546 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why the hell did your heart
stop beating, Dad?

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.014 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't believe
my father is actually dead.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.952 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think he'll be okay
if I can get his Stand back.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.888 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can help you.

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.122 position:33% line:83% align:start
I can explain
these new abilities.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.125 position:33% line:83% align:start
What you have
is called a Stand Power.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.227 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need to see her.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.696 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've got questions...

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.732 position:33% line:89% align:start
Jolyne Cujoh.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.605 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] I see.

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.140 position:10% line:89% align:start
So... Ermes has a Stand too.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.644 position:19% line:83% align:start
-And about the discs...
-[affirming grunt]

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:44.244 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know it sounds crazy,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:45.647 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I'm telling you the truth.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
When Ermes put the memory disc
back into McQueen,

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:50.317 position:21% line:83% align:start
he suddenly came back
to life.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.452 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's like he regenerated!

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:55.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we can somehow
retrieve those discs, Jolyne,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
then I have complete faith
your father will surely...

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.061 position:35% line:89% align:start
So tell me,

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.096 position:10% line:83% align:start
what'd you do with the discs
that were in that man?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.999 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm keeping them safe
with me.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:06.333 position:16% line:89% align:start
They're both right here.

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
If Ermes were to take them
into her cell,

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:11.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
the guards would
definitely find them

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.540 position:19% line:89% align:start
during the body check.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:14.943 position:27% line:83% align:start
I won't be giving
the Stand disc back to him,

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.578 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'll return the disc with
his memories

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.078 position:19% line:89% align:start
after some time passes.

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:22.115 position:16% line:89% align:start
McQueen's memory disc...

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:24.484 position:35% line:89% align:start
On this CD,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
there are memories that
can give me

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
some idea of
who's behind Pale Snake.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.691 position:33% line:89% align:start
And maybe...

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:32.694 position:10% line:83% align:start
even memories about the discs
from my old man.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.113 position:24% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Hurry up!

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
Help! Help me with the door.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.819 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was minding my business,
doing my job.

00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:00.187 position:10% line:89% align:start
All I did was touch the tire!

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.222 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why is this happening?
[whimpers]

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.191 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasping] Just hurry!

Get your ass in here!

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
We gotta close the door!
Get up and help me out!

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Yeah.

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:19.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
Give it your all!

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're almost there!
Keep pulling!

-What's wrong with you?

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.615 position:16% line:83% align:start
Pull harder or we're both
gonna die in here!

[squelches]

Bro, those ain't my arms.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.588 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:35.188 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know...

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.359 position:13% line:83% align:start
The one who wasn't pulling
hard enough was me.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
Get outta here
before it's too late!

[Locobaroco exhales] What nice
weather we're having today.

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:47.054 position:7% line:89% align:start
Although, little Ms. Charlotte,

00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:48.388 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hear there's been
some commotion

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.024 position:33% line:83% align:start
happening on
the grounds lately.

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:51.159 position:10% line:89% align:start
Would you mind telling us why

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:52.660 position:30% line:83% align:start
we've gathered
everyone here today?

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
Earlier this morning,
two inmates who were working

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:57.732 position:21% line:83% align:start
on the farm suddenly
disappeared without a trace.

00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.233 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you serious?

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:01.636 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, wow!
That is absolutely awful!

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.070 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Charlotte]
It's unthinkable that

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:05.106 position:27% line:83% align:start
these two inmates
were able to escape.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
Could they have fallen into
the marshland and drowned?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.177 position:13% line:89% align:start
Or been bitten by a snake?

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
Regardless, we have to do
everything we can

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:12.847 position:10% line:89% align:start
to find those two right now!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Why aren't you
considering the possibility

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:17.618 position:13% line:83% align:start
that an alligator could've
had them for breakfast?

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:19.452 position:13% line:89% align:start
Might've been a female one.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold it! Which one
of you said that nonsense?

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.258 position:10% line:89% align:start
No way! I did no such thing.

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:27.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
My diet is criminal free,
thank you!

00:05:28.663 --> 00:05:30.832 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hm, well, on to business...

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're putting together
a search party,

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.235 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I'll be needing
a select few of you ladies

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:35.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
to do the deed.

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:37.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
You will not
receive compensation,

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
nor will any time be docked
from your sentences.

00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:41.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm merely requesting
you help us

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
out of the kindness
of your hearts.

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:45.613 position:30% line:89% align:start
Any volunteers?

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.514 position:41% line:89% align:start

[stiffly exhales]

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.329 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you doing, Jolyne?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.531 position:33% line:83% align:start
You literally
just got out of solitary.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:06.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why are you trying to tire
yourself out even more?

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.769 position:33% line:83% align:start
Maybe because
you're not going to be there.

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:09.670 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:12.740 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now, let's see.
Five of you should do.

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
Guard, I'll leave
the precautions to you.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.145 position:24% line:83% align:start
In order to prevent
attempts at escaping,

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:19.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
we've got these
nifty bracelets.

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.083 position:27% line:83% align:start
All inmates going
to the farm must wear them.

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:24.685 position:7% line:89% align:start
We call them "Like a Virgins,"

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.655 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they're also known
as "invisible bars."

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.389 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you hit these
with any type of force,

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.194 position:21% line:83% align:start
try taking them off,
or even destroy them,

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.762 position:7% line:89% align:start
they will explode immediately.

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:38.666 position:13% line:83% align:start
Also, I have the base unit
on my wrist.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you go any more than
50 meters away,

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:41.836 position:27% line:89% align:start
they'll detonate.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let me tell you,
it's gonna be real hard

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
to wipe your ass
if you don't have a wrist!

Wait just a second! Hey!

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.344 position:27% line:83% align:start
Okay! From here,
we'll split up

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
and search in every direction!

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:27.949 position:13% line:83% align:start

over there is a marsh,

Safe to say it's not in here.

00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:44.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Why'd you volunteer

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
for this scavenger hunt,
Jolyne?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.469 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though, I am glad
you decided to come along.

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've got a few questions
for you,

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:52.807 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I'd like some answers.

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:55.609 position:27% line:83% align:start
About this whole
disc situation,

00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:56.811 position:21% line:89% align:start
and more importantly,

00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:59.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
this Pale Snake guy
I've heard so much about.

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.682 position:16% line:89% align:start
Before that, answer this.

00:08:01.716 --> 00:08:03.551 position:35% line:83% align:start
Did you see
what was on that disc?

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.453 position:19% line:83% align:start
The one from the inmate
named McQueen.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.788 position:35% line:83% align:start
Huh? Yeah,
I gave it a look over,

00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:10.490 position:13% line:83% align:start
but messing with that thing
made me feel horrible.

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:11.692 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whenever I touched it,

00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:14.095 position:27% line:83% align:start
this awful smell
assaulted my senses.

00:08:14.128 --> 00:08:15.796 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, you didn't notice it then.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.697 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:18.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you take a closer look
at the footage

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.967 position:24% line:89% align:start
that was recorded,

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.669 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll see there's a clue
that could reveal

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:23.371 position:16% line:89% align:start
Pale Snake's intentions.

This disc is perfect for you.
It'll suit you well.

00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:37.284 position:19% line:89% align:start
It shall be yours now.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.787 position:19% line:83% align:start
Take this Stand ability
and prosper.

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.626 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] He's got more of
these stockpiled

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.695 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the farm tractor's tire?

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:51.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
There had to be at least
two dozen more discs

00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:52.633 position:21% line:89% align:start
hidden away in there!

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:54.935 position:30% line:83% align:start
Understand what
he's trying to do now?

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:57.038 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's probably
been robbing Stand Users,

00:08:57.071 --> 00:08:58.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
taking their memories
and abilities

00:08:58.706 --> 00:09:00.341 position:10% line:89% align:start
for his personal collection!

[gasps]

00:09:01.776 --> 00:09:04.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
With the amount of discs
that he's gathered together,

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.447 position:10% line:83% align:start
he'd need to make sure other
inmates and guards

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.548 position:19% line:89% align:start
couldn't discover them,

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
hence the secluded
hiding spot.

00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:12.486 position:13% line:89% align:start
No one'd ever check a tire.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:14.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
My dad's might be there too.

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.690 position:10% line:83% align:start
The discs with Star Platinum
and his memories

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.559 position:13% line:83% align:start
have got to be hidden away
with the rest.

00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.327 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Your dad?

00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:22.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
So the whole reason
you're doing this

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:23.532 position:19% line:89% align:start
is to find your dad's?

Sorry, but that's about
all I know

00:09:28.636 --> 00:09:30.171 position:16% line:89% align:start
regarding this situation.

we're on a farm,

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:47.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
there are probably gonna be
a lot of them.

you're out here for, a picnic?

and get to searching!

Actually, we were just
about to check

that building over there.

Nah, not particularly.

00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:21.822 position:27% line:83% align:start

my solemn vow

to run around this farm and

you know?

It was a coincidence
that my baton was swinging

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.508 position:10% line:89% align:start
They should be in that tire.

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:56.544 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we can remove it,
we'll find the discs inside.

00:12:56.578 --> 00:12:58.078 position:27% line:89% align:start
Listen carefully!

00:12:58.112 --> 00:13:00.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
We will now be moving
our search to the marshland!

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:02.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's possible that
our missing convicts

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:03.917 position:19% line:89% align:start
were attacked by gators

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:06.521 position:16% line:83% align:start
or drowned in the water!
Now, get swimming!

00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:13:08.022 --> 00:13:10.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who exactly do you think
is getting in that water?

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:11.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
'Cause it ain't gonna be me.

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:13.327 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
[inmate 4] He can ride that
on land and water?

00:13:16.564 --> 00:13:17.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:19.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we step foot in that marsh,

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:21.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're just asking
for diseases.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.803 position:35% line:83% align:start
[inmate 2]
This is so annoying.

00:13:23.404 --> 00:13:24.739 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's take it off.

00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:26.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now's our chance
to remove that tire.

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:29.143 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, Jolyne. You feel that?

00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:31.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
Something real strange
is going on here.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
I mean,
this is definitely bizarre.

00:13:33.715 --> 00:13:36.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. If we don't remove
the tire right now,

00:13:36.417 --> 00:13:38.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
the guard will keep moving
farther away from us.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.254 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's not what I'm saying.

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:41.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you remember
what the chief said

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:42.823 position:27% line:89% align:start
when we started?

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:44.358 position:16% line:89% align:start
He mentioned five people.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:44.892 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right?
-[gasps]

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:46.193 position:30% line:89% align:start
Before we left,

00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:48.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
he definitely said,
"Five of you should be fine."

00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:51.031 position:10% line:89% align:start
But now, there are six of us!

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:53.967 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jolyne. What the hell
do you think is going on?

00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.103 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you include
the two of us...

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
there are six of us here!

00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure when
we took off earlier,

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.210 position:21% line:89% align:start
there were only five.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:06.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I never took a good look
at the other girl's faces.

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:09.584 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, do you see
the same thing?

00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:11.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't say for sure.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.287 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was so focused on running.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Although, everyone
is wearing a handcuff.

00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:18.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
[inmate 4] This is weird.

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:21.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
Were there always...
six of us here?

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.430 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[both gasp]
-I mean, from the beginning?

00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:25.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yo! What'd you just say?
So you noticed it too, huh?

00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:27.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
[exhales nervously]

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're thinking that
when we all first started,

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:30.505 position:13% line:83% align:start
there were only five of us,
aren't you?

00:14:30.538 --> 00:14:32.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea
when and who came in?

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:33.775 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:35.242 position:10% line:89% align:start
And I might just be mistaken.

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.811 position:38% line:83% align:start
Besides,
it doesn't really matter

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:38.145 position:24% line:89% align:start
how many there are.

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:39.313 position:35% line:83% align:start
[inmate 1]
I can vouch for her.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.382 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was with me
from the beginning.

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:44.184 position:30% line:83% align:start
I remember her.
Her name is Atroe.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:46.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
I always see her
getting bullied.

00:14:46.654 --> 00:14:48.021 position:30% line:83% align:start
You volunteered
for this search

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.791 position:21% line:83% align:start
because your bullies
didn't come along.

00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:50.859 position:35% line:89% align:start
That right?

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.494 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, but I have no idea
who you are.

00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:55.028 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hey!
-[beeps]

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.464 position:19% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Wait, hold on,
what's happening?

00:14:57.498 --> 00:14:59.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't do anything.
Why is my handcuff beeping?

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:02.469 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[beeping]
-[gasps] Mine is too!

00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:03.437 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, same here!

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:05.640 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hey, what the hell?

00:15:05.673 --> 00:15:06.841 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now everyone's cuff
is beeping!

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:09.343 position:19% line:83% align:start
The motorbike went more
than 50 meters away!

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:12.012 position:38% line:83% align:start
But how?
It shouldn't be that far!

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:15.149 position:19% line:83% align:start
[gasps] The...The guard
isn't there anymore!

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.984 position:16% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Where did he go?

00:15:17.652 --> 00:15:20.154 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:24.692 position:16% line:83% align:start
The motorbike is covered
in blood!

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:25.993 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wh--Why though?

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:28.362 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think I know why
all the cuffs keep beeping!

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's gotta be because
the guard's body

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:32.099 position:19% line:83% align:start
is moving farther away
from where we are!

00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
Could he have fallen into
the water

00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:34.869 position:16% line:89% align:start
and is being washed away?

00:15:34.903 --> 00:15:36.905 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ugh, just find
that stupid prick!

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:39.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wherever he is, he's more
than 50 meters away!

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:39.973 position:27% line:89% align:start
This ain't good!

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:41.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
[beeping quickens]

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:42.976 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh. Hey, you guys!

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.513 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is bad!
Mine is getting really fast!

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:49.983 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all screaming]

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.251 position:30% line:89% align:start
There's no way!

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.891 position:10% line:89% align:start
[inmate 1] Sh--She's dead...

00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:58.025 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Could it be...

00:15:58.058 --> 00:16:01.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
the additional person
decided to attack?

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:03.263 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is it because we got
too close to those discs

00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:05.098 position:35% line:83% align:start
hidden away
in the storehouse?

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:07.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
[inmate 1] Look 50 meters
in the opposite direction

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:08.736 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the girl that blew up.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.105 position:13% line:89% align:start
[panting] He's over there!

00:16:12.907 --> 00:16:14.208 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let's get to
the guard, hurry!

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we're close to him,
this beeping will stop

00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:18.078 position:16% line:89% align:start
and we won't explode too!

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:19.814 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, watch your back, Jolyne.

00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:21.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
No doubt the enemy
has got to be

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:25.018 position:10% line:83% align:start
one of those three girls and
an enraged psychopath!

00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:27.454 position:13% line:83% align:start
Personally, I already know
who I'm suspicious of.

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.223 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet it's that chick
with the undercut.

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
I mean, the girl
who blew up did say

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
she didn't know who she was!

00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's gotta be her,
I'm tellin' you!

00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:36.698 position:24% line:83% align:start
She used her Stand
to take out the guard!

00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:38.933 position:16% line:83% align:start
And before she kills us,
we gotta get the bitch.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.134 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hold on a second, Ermes.

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.805 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's say our culprit
is who you think it is.

00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
If that were the case,
doesn't that mean

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.208 position:13% line:83% align:start
she would've been guarding
the discs in that storehouse

00:16:48.242 --> 00:16:49.511 position:13% line:89% align:start
since before we showed up?

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:51.980 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I guess
that's just about right.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.080 position:19% line:89% align:start
But that's impossible.

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:54.816 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's still a prisoner,

00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:58.252 position:10% line:83% align:start
and there's no way a prisoner
can guard something 24/7.

-[gasps]

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:07.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jolyne, stand back!
Something is in there!

00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:08.161 position:33% line:89% align:start
What? Where?

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.264 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stay the hell away
from the water!

00:17:10.297 --> 00:17:12.132 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's somethin'
in this bucket!

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.007 position:35% line:83% align:start
Ermes, hey.
Did you really see something?

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:19.674 position:44% line:89% align:start
No...

00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:25.112 position:21% line:89% align:start
Guess it was nothing.

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:28.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
But still, I won't be going
in this marsh ever again.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:29.751 position:24% line:89% align:start
Stay close, Jolyne.

00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:32.520 position:10% line:83% align:start
The last thing we need is to
get separated from each other,

00:17:32.554 --> 00:17:35.489 position:16% line:83% align:start
especially since we have
no idea who the enemy is.

00:17:35.523 --> 00:17:35.690 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.424 position:24% line:89% align:start
And we've still got

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.359 position:13% line:83% align:start
these troublesome handcuffs
to deal with.

00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:41.529 position:13% line:83% align:start
In order to take the discs
from the storehouse,

00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:43.163 position:21% line:83% align:start
we have to make sure
we stay within

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:44.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
50 meters of the guard's body,

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
and the other three prisoners.

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:18.619 position:10% line:83% align:start
They were hiding in the water
of the bucket I kicked.

00:20:18.653 --> 00:20:21.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then when I turned around,
they dragged me in!

I understand that.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm asking you
not to stand up.

00:20:25.159 --> 00:20:27.628 position:19% line:83% align:start
You gotta grab onto it

As the Stand moves farther
away from its user,

it should become weaker
