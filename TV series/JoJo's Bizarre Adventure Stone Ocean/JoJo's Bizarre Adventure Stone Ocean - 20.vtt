Do you want to kiss or not?

[Jolyne] He's an automatic
pursuit-style Stand.

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:10.217 position:10% line:83% align:start
He obediently follows orders
like a slave,

effed up little trick.

00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:17.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's a Stand that

for the moments when
we're most off-guard,

of lard, blood and brains.

It's a wonderful beauty secret.

I can catch ten more

then it makes sense that

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.162 position:21% line:83% align:start

to his attacks.

I stretched my thread
over my skin

leave D an' G to the medics,
