00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
you absolutely cannot go

[Jotaro] Johngalli A.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's the one
who plotted everything.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
In other words, Johngalli A.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.705 position:24% line:83% align:start
is most definitely
a Stand User.

All you need to understand

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.875 position:21% line:83% align:start
is that you're being
targeted right now.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.667 position:35% line:83% align:start
Don't move!
He's begun his assault.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.003 position:21% line:83% align:start
So it was reacting to
the air currents

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:12.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
in order to predict
our location.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't move until we know
the mechanism of the snipes.

-Don't move.

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
And be sure not to
raise your voice.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
It will keep
scouting our location.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.510 position:10% line:89% align:start
Johngalli A. is able to read

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.913 position:30% line:83% align:start
the flow of air
with that thing.

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
It could even be able
to react

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.215 position:30% line:83% align:start
to mild changes
in our breathing.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:57.852 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that Stand
is a satellite.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:59.386 position:19% line:89% align:start
His sniping satellite,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.188 position:19% line:83% align:start
where he aims his rifle
at the Stand,

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.123 position:21% line:83% align:start
which then redirects
the bullet.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.292 position:30% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. is
in the men's prison.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no way we can
attack him from this room,

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.099 position:24% line:83% align:start
so instead we have
to smash his satellite Stand.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.101 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because any damage inflicted
on the Stand

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.802 position:21% line:83% align:start
is passed through to
the User as well.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.470 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I know.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:20.240 position:19% line:83% align:start
But... the problem is,
when we move to strike it,

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.475 position:33% line:83% align:start
the change in
the air current

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.077 position:10% line:89% align:start
will give him our locations,

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:24.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
and he'll attack us
immediately.

I can hardly afford

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.936 position:10% line:89% align:start
to place my faith in muscles.

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.872 position:16% line:83% align:start
When the skin is exposed
to the wind,

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:06.406 position:19% line:89% align:start
muscles become stressed

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
and cause subtle expansions
and contractions.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.279 position:21% line:83% align:start
These minor movements
are ones

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
that the body cannot control.

The bone embraces
the certainty of the ground,

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.523 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the gun unifies with it.

00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:24.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
I place my trust
in that stability.

Meteorologists say

00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:29.096 position:30% line:83% align:start
wind movements
are unpredictable,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.631 position:19% line:89% align:start
and they have a point.

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:33.167 position:21% line:83% align:start

it's impossible.

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:40.641 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hardly.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:43.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
This fly is guided
by the smell

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
and flow of the air
as it flies.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.849 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.102 position:35% line:89% align:start
That hurt.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.105 position:33% line:89% align:start
This thing...

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:33.808 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right.
You gave this to me earlier.

00:14:33.842 --> 00:14:35.677 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.211 position:10% line:89% align:start
Looks like some kind of bone.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:39.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why did you hand this to me?

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:41.181 position:21% line:83% align:start
You told me not to go
to the visiting room.

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:43.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
How do you know
so much about me?

00:14:43.718 --> 00:14:44.586 position:33% line:89% align:start
[small gasp]

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:46.253 position:27% line:89% align:start
I want an answer!

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:50.124 position:35% line:83% align:start
In time...
things will be... revealed.

00:14:50.157 --> 00:14:51.793 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just hold onto
what I gave you,

00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:52.960 position:30% line:89% align:start
no matter what.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:59.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
The smell... is that your doing?

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:02.069 position:35% line:83% align:start
I captured
Johngalli A.'s sniper Stand.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
He wasn't so tough
when I had it in my net.

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.609 position:41% line:83% align:start
And so,
I smashed it to pieces.

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:08.108 position:21% line:89% align:start
[theme song playing]

00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:09.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:10.812 position:7% line:83% align:start
It would appear you've already
grown accustomed

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:13.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
accustomed to fighting
using your Stand.

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.382 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's not like
I wanted to. [gasps]

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:20.387 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.024 position:21% line:89% align:start
[breathes nervously]

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:27.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's in here! Behind that!
I just saw him moving!

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.299 position:7% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Hide! He has a rifle!

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:34.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's up there
behind that pipe!

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:36.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
He crawled up above
that tank.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.305 position:16% line:89% align:start
That would be impossible.

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:39.841 position:33% line:83% align:start
He fired from
the men's prison,

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:42.209 position:10% line:83% align:start
which is two to three hundred
meters away.

00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:44.813 position:10% line:89% align:start
Add in dozens of steel bars,

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:46.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the fact that
the man is almost blind,

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.650 position:19% line:83% align:start
how in the world would
he have been able

00:15:48.683 --> 00:15:49.717 position:19% line:89% align:start
to get here so quickly?

00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:52.953 position:19% line:83% align:start
No idea, but I saw him
in here with us!

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:54.488 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get down! [gasps]

00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:58.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's in the crawl space
above you!

00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.663 position:19% line:89% align:start
Very well. I trust you.

00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:03.330 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ora!

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:04.532 position:35% line:89% align:start
[crackling]

00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:06.233 position:27% line:89% align:start
Prepare yourself.

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.603 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure enough gas
has accumulated by now.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:17.344 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:18.646 position:38% line:89% align:start
[clanks]

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.013 position:35% line:89% align:start
We did it!

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.617 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, the coast is clear now!
Huh?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.518 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.286 position:16% line:89% align:start
The kid... where'd he go?

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:29.557 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, you can come out.

00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:31.358 position:10% line:89% align:start
We took care of the bad guy!

00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:33.828 position:33% line:83% align:start
Come out and
tell me what's going on!

00:16:33.862 --> 00:16:35.597 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, what are you doing?

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.798 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm looking for the kid!

00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you happen to see
which way the little boy went?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.770 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand
what you're asking.

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.772 position:30% line:83% align:start
Who's this boy
you're talking about?

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:46.073 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:16:46.975 --> 00:16:48.275 position:24% line:89% align:start
There was this kid.

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:50.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
How could you not see him
in his baseball gear?

00:16:50.812 --> 00:16:51.980 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's who I was talking to

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.681 position:30% line:83% align:start
when we were in
the visiting room.

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:54.649 position:27% line:89% align:start
It was this boy.

00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:57.117 position:10% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. was even trying
to kill this kid

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.520 position:19% line:89% align:start
for getting in his way.

00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:00.320 position:38% line:89% align:start
Kill him?

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:03.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
Seriously, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
You came all the way down
to this room on your own.

00:17:06.928 --> 00:17:09.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I decided to
follow you down.

00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:11.933 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Hang on.
That doesn't make any sense.

00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:14.401 position:24% line:83% align:start
You should've heard
the boy's voice at least.

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.738 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
you wouldn't have heard him!

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:17.906 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's the one who told us

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:19.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
about the secret passage
in the first place.

00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:22.175 position:10% line:89% align:start
We talked about it, remember?

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.111 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you hear a ghost talking?

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.046 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't know anything
about secret passageways.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.147 position:27% line:89% align:start
Damn it, old man!

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.650 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why are you trying to mess
with my head

00:17:28.683 --> 00:17:29.651 position:21% line:89% align:start
at a time like this?

00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:31.753 position:21% line:83% align:start
You came here through
that secret passageway

00:17:31.786 --> 00:17:32.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
just like I did!

00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:34.054 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.125 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait a second...

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:41.829 position:19% line:83% align:start
S--Something about you
just seems off...

00:17:41.863 --> 00:17:43.363 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your wound.

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:45.900 position:19% line:83% align:start
What the hell happened
to that bullet wound you had?

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
A wound?

00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:49.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
Johngalli A. shot you
in your left shoulder.

00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:50.638 position:38% line:89% align:start
I saw it.

00:17:50.672 --> 00:17:54.107 position:27% line:83% align:start
And yet your arm
isn't bleeding... at all.

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:56.376 position:19% line:89% align:start
[gasps] What? Mine too!

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
My gunshot wound
just disappeared!

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.848 position:16% line:89% align:start
[gasps] And who is this?

00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:04.351 position:5% line:89% align:start
[gasps] That isn't Johngalli A.!

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.153 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's one of the guards!

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.288 position:7% line:83% align:start
But... I thought he'd been shot
in the head

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:09.624 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the visiting room!

00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:11.559 position:13% line:89% align:start
No sign of a wound at all.

00:18:11.593 --> 00:18:13.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
What gunshots are
you talking about?

00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:15.964 position:21% line:83% align:start
And who the devil is
this "Johngalli A."?

00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:17.230 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:21.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
What the hell is happening?
This can't be right.

00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:22.670 position:13% line:89% align:start
It doesn't make any sense!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.371 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:28.076 --> 00:18:30.177 position:13% line:89% align:start
What the hell is going on?!

00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:40.722 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know that something
even more unfortunate

00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:42.557 position:19% line:89% align:start
than death will occur.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.892 position:30% line:83% align:start
No matter what,
you absolutely cannot go

00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:45.960 position:21% line:89% align:start
to the visiting room.

00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:47.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
The visiting room...

00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:50.497 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's right. It was odd
right from the start!

00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.165 position:33% line:89% align:start
My handcuffs.

00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:54.068 position:16% line:89% align:start
When did they disappear?

00:18:54.102 --> 00:18:56.403 position:24% line:83% align:start
And that bullet...
I'd been shot!

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.405 position:24% line:83% align:start
But did any of that
really happen?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.042 position:30% line:89% align:start
Neither myself

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:02.510 position:13% line:89% align:start
nor Dad are even wounded...

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.479 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did Johngalli A.
even attack us?

00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:07.515 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't keep things straight
anymore.

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:11.653 position:33% line:83% align:start
How strange.
None of this makes any sense!

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.324 position:24% line:89% align:start
This isn't reality!

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:20.528 position:16% line:89% align:start
I must be hallucinating.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:23.163 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or else...
it's someone else's doing!

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:24.364 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:26.166 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it!

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:30.071 position:35% line:89% align:start

A dream?

Was that all... a dream?

00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:49.423 position:41% line:83% align:start
But...
When did I start dreaming?

[oozing]

00:19:53.528 --> 00:19:56.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like I really did
beat up that guard though.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:57.899 position:21% line:89% align:start
I guess that's real.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.869 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a photo of
Johngalli A...

00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:06.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's the same one
that Dad showed me.

00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:09.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
He told me about
the accident

00:20:09.177 --> 00:20:10.878 position:21% line:89% align:start
with the hitchhiker.

00:20:10.912 --> 00:20:12.847 position:27% line:83% align:start
How Johngalli A.
set it all up...

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:14.716 position:33% line:89% align:start
back then...

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:16.517 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's real.

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:19.987 position:21% line:89% align:start
After that, I got up

00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:22.355 position:10% line:89% align:start
and tried to leave this room.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.992 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's when I realized
my handcuffs were gone.

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.260 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ever since then...

00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:30.198 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.166 position:19% line:83% align:start
if we're still sitting
at this table,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
it happened before that.

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.904 position:19% line:83% align:start
I haven't stepped foot
out of the visiting room

00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:38.405 position:27% line:89% align:start
since I got here.

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:40.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
That means...

00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:43.611 position:19% line:89% align:start
My mind made it all up?

00:20:44.212 --> 00:20:45.747 position:21% line:89% align:start
Johngalli A.'s Stand?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.315 position:27% line:83% align:start
All that bullshit
about air currents?

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:54.088 position:19% line:89% align:start
The secret passageway,

00:20:54.122 --> 00:20:55.857 position:21% line:89% align:start
and what followed...

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
From the moment we stepped
into this visitation room,

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:00.795 position:24% line:89% align:start
we fell into a trap

00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:04.264 position:33% line:83% align:start
and have been
hallucinating ever since...

00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:07.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
Slowly, but surely,

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:09.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
as if we were sitting
in a huge snake's stomach,

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:12.039 position:21% line:89% align:start
we were melting away!

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.441 position:27% line:83% align:start
The boy hiding in
the trash can,

00:21:14.474 --> 00:21:15.910 position:16% line:89% align:start
who gave me this bone...

00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:17.779 position:35% line:89% align:start
He's real!

00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.582 position:38% line:83% align:start
I woke up
from this nightmare

00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:24.819 position:19% line:83% align:start
because I hurt my hand
on this bone.

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:27.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
Without this sharp pain,

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:29.257 position:16% line:83% align:start
I would've stayed asleep
and died!

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.423 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.293 position:16% line:89% align:start
This power of illusions.

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:35.930 position:33% line:83% align:start
This must be
Johngalli A.'s actual Stand!

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
[screams in pain]

00:21:40.101 --> 00:21:41.102 position:38% line:89% align:start
[hisses]

00:21:41.135 --> 00:21:43.604 position:35% line:83% align:start
My thread.
I can't keep it together!

00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:47.340 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, shit!

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:49.777 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:50.711 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it.

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:53.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm tired,

00:21:53.047 --> 00:21:54.982 position:7% line:89% align:start
but I can't go to sleep again.

00:21:55.016 --> 00:21:55.883 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:21:56.684 --> 00:21:58.619 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not going out like this.

00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:03.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to escape from
this god damn room!

00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:07.762 position:21% line:89% align:start
[grunting in effort]

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.097 position:35% line:89% align:start
