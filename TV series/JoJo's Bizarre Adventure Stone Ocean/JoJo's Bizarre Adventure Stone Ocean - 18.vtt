00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.076 position:33% line:83% align:start
Criss-cross,
are you available to help us?

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.146 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Okay! I'll help you.
-[gasps]

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
If you really want,

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:15.750 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll protect Jolyne.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:17.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
[F.F] I'm gonna take
this creepy old geezer out.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.089 position:13% line:89% align:start
Direction facing southeast,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
127 degrees,
30 minutes, 20 seconds.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:29.597 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gunshots]

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.299 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just be aware,
you won't survive this time.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.233 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
West-southwest,
225 degrees, 0 minutes.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.240 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, F.F.,
he's right behind you!

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you your real enemy
is that insane old man.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:50.952 position:41% line:83% align:start
No way!
Now, his arm is flying

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
right to the back
of F.F.'s head.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.588 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.892 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[both gasp]
-[Drake's Dream] Huh?

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:00.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] There is no freaking
way that was a coincidence.

00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:02.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
That inmate's glasses flew
straight at F.F.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:04.832 position:19% line:83% align:start
and launched themselves
in her face?

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unfortunate direction.
[sighs]

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.770 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm starting to understand.

00:01:08.803 --> 00:01:10.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's Feng Shui in action.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.974 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's geomancy
for the East Asians.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:14.474 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
With that dragon Stand,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kenzou can perfectly control
the direction of his attacks.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Drake's Dream] F.F.,
next unlucky spot is here.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right above your left ear.
Feel it?

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.352 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes, that did just happen.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
My Stand attack has merged
with the course of your death.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.237 position:38% line:89% align:start
No! F.F.!

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.711 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is bad! Really bad!

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:50.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Don't touch them!
-[gasps]

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:52.346 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no point.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.016 position:10% line:83% align:start
The unlucky direction exists
in our bodies, too.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.584 position:10% line:89% align:start
That can only mean one thing.

00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:59.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
It means that once
the direction's chosen,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.455 position:35% line:83% align:start
no organism
can defend themselves

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
or escape the cruel
inevitability of dying.

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.425 position:13% line:89% align:start
His next target will be...

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:07.595 position:33% line:89% align:start
you, Jolyne.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.697 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hiyah!

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:10.898 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:17.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
You misunderstood.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:20.207 position:35% line:83% align:start
When I said
this is bad just now,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.342 position:30% line:83% align:start
it wasn't about
the giant hole in F.F.'s head.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
To be totally honest,
the plain fact that

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:28.281 position:10% line:83% align:start
they're injuries and bleeding
is more of a relief.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Here's the bad thing.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:32.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's barely
any blood at all.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
Her wounds are so severe

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
that there's not enough
fluids left to keep her alive.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.560 position:10% line:83% align:start
All the F.F.s in her body are
almost completely wiped out.

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:43.330 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ugh, I'm so happy
none of it spilt.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
But still,
that's unlucky for sure.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:47.935 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.910 position:10% line:83% align:start
What? Come back here, dragon!
How dare you?

00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:40.581 position:35% line:89% align:start
Son of a--

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.255 position:16% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] You're losing
your touch, old man!

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.322 position:33% line:83% align:start
Never again!
[grunts]

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.491 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll never be careless and
step away

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:53.027 position:7% line:89% align:start
from the safe direction again.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
I knew better than that,
and I am better than that.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.132 position:19% line:89% align:start
[F.F. breathes heavily]

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:02.402 position:10% line:83% align:start
Agh! Son of a... He got away
from me to a safe direction.

00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:04.304 position:33% line:89% align:start
But still...

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.207 position:7% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Speaking of directions,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.909 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm learning something
valuable here,

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:09.043 position:13% line:89% align:start
how I can best breach them.

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:13.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
A mirror!
I need a mirror right now!

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:15.448 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I can create
a mirror midair,

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.685 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can beam the dragon's
reflection off its surface,

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.320 position:13% line:83% align:start
and fool Kenzou into moving
away from his safe space.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.690 position:33% line:83% align:start
That gives me
the perfect window

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.826 position:30% line:83% align:start
to beat up that
rotting bag of skin.

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:27.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
[breathes heavily]
What I need the most is water.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.765 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:34.802 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can use water
to make a mirror.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:38.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
Obviously, I need it to recover
from my injuries, too.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.042 position:19% line:83% align:start
But the only way I can
possibly make a mirror midair

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:42.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
is if I can get some water.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.412 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Kenzou groans]
In a not-so-distant past,

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.950 position:13% line:83% align:start
some 30,000 loyal disciples
of mine worshipped me,

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:50.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
eagerly learned my teachings

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
and rapidly followed
in my footsteps.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:56.123 position:19% line:83% align:start
But not now! Ever since
being incarcerated here,

00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:59.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
their love and loyalty
has turned into fueled disgust.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everyone looked down on me,
laughed and turned away.

00:06:02.597 --> 00:06:05.132 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even degenerates that
abducted children

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
and did unspeakable things
to them

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
saw me as beneath them.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.105 position:30% line:83% align:start
Forty years...
[sniffles]

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.307 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Kenzou] Forty long hard years!

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:16.476 position:41% line:83% align:start
Honor!
It was true honor, I tell you.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
Forty years ago,

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:21.481 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was at the top
of the world, a shining star.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kenzou] And my former glory
will return. I swear!

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.354 position:10% line:89% align:start
My wisdom on Feng Shui which

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
rendered me the only survivor
of that fire

00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:30.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
appeared in the form
of a Stand.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.660 position:7% line:83% align:start
As soon as I am floating here,
glaring at you,

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:35.229 position:27% line:83% align:start
people will soon
call me Founder once again.

00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:36.898 position:10% line:89% align:start
And they will all follow me,

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
even if I never see outside
this prison again.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only thing I have left
to do now is finish you off.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.640 position:7% line:89% align:start
For the last time, you show me.

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:47.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
I command you now,
Drake's Dream.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:49.377 position:27% line:83% align:start
You will show me
the precise direction

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.512 position:19% line:89% align:start
of my finishing attack.

00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:57.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Over there, F.F. On the
other side of the stairs.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.021 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a fire hose!
Run and grab it, hurry!

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.491 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathes heavily]

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.032 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, asshole!

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:13.668 position:7% line:83% align:start
Instead of just standing there
watching and giving commentary,

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.468 position:21% line:89% align:start
you can help out F.F.

00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:16.971 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're a Stand User, right?

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
The two of you can beat
that old bastard together.

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.343 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
I'll help if F.F. dies.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:23.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.246 position:24% line:89% align:start
Before I came here,

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
helping F.F. was never
part of the deal.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:30.184 position:24% line:83% align:start
The sworn agreement
was to protect only you.

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:35.523 position:7% line:83% align:start
And besides, F.F. said themself
not to step in for them.

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:38.025 position:7% line:83% align:start
They saw that you were injured
when we got here,

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.895 position:13% line:83% align:start
and asked me to protect you
from other dangerous enemies

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.164 position:33% line:83% align:start
who are still
in the punishment cells.

00:07:43.197 --> 00:07:44.464 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Oh, where is it?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
I gotta get the water
running now.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where the hell is the faucet?

00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:54.208 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:58.079 position:5% line:83% align:start
Be careful what you touch.
This is your unlucky direction.

00:07:58.112 --> 00:08:00.147 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must protect it fiercely.

00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:03.483 position:7% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, its definite attack
will head your way.

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:04.919 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no time to be doing

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
something silly like
drinking water.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:20.935 position:10% line:83% align:start
F.F.! No! What are you doing?
Please, stop!

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.604 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] An attack has already
been decided, get it?

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is not going
to end well for you.

00:08:27.408 --> 00:08:28.242 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hiyah!

00:08:30.244 --> 00:08:31.112 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.583 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.053 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:43.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-Rather than a decided attack

00:08:43.457 --> 00:08:45.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
or being led into bad luck,

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.561 position:24% line:83% align:start
it looks like more
than anything else.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
What F.F. really needs
is water.

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:51.665 position:19% line:83% align:start
They purposely removed
their arms

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:53.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
to fit their body
into the hose.

00:08:56.837 --> 00:08:58.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, they did it!
They managed to get--

00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:01.809 position:33% line:89% align:start
[F.F. grunts]

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.317 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is your arm. Feng Shui
Assassination has now begun.

00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:12.420 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ah, it's obvious
you wanted to

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:13.988 position:24% line:83% align:start
get some water and
clearly you need it,

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:15.689 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I'm delighted to
inform you

00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:17.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
that nothing will go
your way anymore.

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:19.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
My attacks will continue
to become

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.495 position:27% line:83% align:start
your bad fortune
from here on out.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.065 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's Feng Shui Assassination.

00:09:24.098 --> 00:09:26.535 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kenzou] Drake's Dream!

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:30.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's all pre-determined.
You can not stop destiny.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
[gasps] They almost
got water, but then couldn't.

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:33.808 position:33% line:83% align:start
He won't even
let them touch it.

00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:36.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's gonna happen now?

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.579 position:27% line:83% align:start
Directly beneath
the Discipline Cell here

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:39.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
is the execution room.

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:42.551 position:19% line:89% align:start
Remember, it's Florida!

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
Capital punishment is
a big thing here.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:46.654 position:7% line:89% align:start
Two or three people every year

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:49.190 position:10% line:83% align:start
are executed by electrocution
in the chair

00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:50.658 position:21% line:89% align:start
down in the basement,

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.827 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it uses 2,800 volts.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.627 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.597 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.333 position:35% line:89% align:start
[clanking]

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:05.372 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.178 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ugh! It sucks!

00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:14.148 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can't believe I missed it!
I was so close to the water.

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:16.250 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I was able
to break the faucet off.

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:18.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll just have to get
the water from up there now.

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:21.055 position:7% line:89% align:start
If... If things don't change...

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:22.356 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-[thuds]

00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:26.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] The planktons
would certainly

00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:28.062 position:27% line:83% align:start
be annihilated in
less than a second.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:29.930 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:32.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, holy shit!
Is that the chair?

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.703 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:36.704 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[beeps]
-[gasps]

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.375 position:30% line:83% align:start
What the hell?
It's counting down.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:42.643 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is it already live?

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.746 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or does that mean
it turns on when it hits zero?

00:10:47.616 --> 00:10:49.350 position:7% line:89% align:start
Not if I can help it, it won't!

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.822 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:57.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kenzou] I was curious.
After I unleashed my attacks,

00:10:57.658 --> 00:11:00.461 position:30% line:83% align:start
what's the end
going to look like for you?

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
That situation...
Anyone could perfectly

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.932 position:27% line:83% align:start
predict what was
going to happen.

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:08.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] He could kiss my ass!

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll get the water dripping
from above before that!

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.773 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense music]

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.922 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:31.158 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:11:32.594 --> 00:11:34.862 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
it's already been decided.

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:37.599 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to be sitting
in that chair. Don't fight it!

00:11:37.632 --> 00:11:39.967 position:30% line:89% align:start
[grunts, yells]

00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.474 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hiyah! You'll never get
your water, so give up!

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:49.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
And the timing's
absolutely perfect.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.780 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kenzou] That precise time,
I'll be finishing you.

00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:15.202 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Oh, god! F.F.!

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:17.639 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kenzou] Yes, the definitive
direction of attack

00:12:17.672 --> 00:12:20.374 position:19% line:83% align:start
and a perfect direction
of protection.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
Feng Shui Assassination.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.178 position:10% line:89% align:start
It took 40 years to achieve,

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:27.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
but this can only mean
that I finally mastered it.

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.719 position:35% line:83% align:start
The Founder
has been resurrected at last!

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:33.187 position:19% line:83% align:start
With this, I'll go down
in history as a Buddha

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
equivalent in power
and glory to Shakyamuni.

00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:38.225 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.961 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm neutral, old man.

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:44.231 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, it's not like I'm gonna
help you out or anything.

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
But you see...

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:50.538 position:7% line:83% align:start
F.F. did manage to obtain water
mere moments ago

00:12:50.572 --> 00:12:51.772 position:7% line:89% align:start
in fact, when you kicked them.

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.108 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wanna know how?

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:58.580 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because a 78-year-old like you
ran around hysterically,

00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:00.147 position:16% line:89% align:start
you perspired abundantly

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.117 position:21% line:83% align:start
because F.F. made you
run around.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your sweat's the water
they used, and you missed it.

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:09.023 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:13.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
It appears that F.F.
can create mirrors using swea.

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:15.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
All it takes is about
a third of a glass

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:16.930 position:16% line:89% align:start
to make a functional one.

00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:20.000 position:33% line:83% align:start
You provided
more than enough for them.

00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:23.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
In other words, if you're
looking at a reflection of me,

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:25.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
that's not at all
your safe direction.

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:27.274 position:10% line:89% align:start
In fact, quite the opposite.

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:28.942 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:31.312 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's an official tie.

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:33.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
The only thing that
has sealed away

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.049 position:35% line:83% align:start
the perfect
Feng Shui Assassination

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.150 position:38% line:89% align:start
is a tie.

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:39.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
F.F. made their resolve
specifically for this.

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:40.888 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:43.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Take this
and choke on it!

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:46.193 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I can share
some bad fortune with you...

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
[voice shaking]
My safe direction!

00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:50.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
[groans in pain]

00:13:56.203 --> 00:13:57.471 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Right!

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:01.408 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-Well, it's over.

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's going to happen next?

00:14:03.812 --> 00:14:05.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll keep looking
for the bone, right?

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.115 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's really what
you should be focused on now.

00:14:08.783 --> 00:14:09.917 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] Silver lining.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:10.884 position:16% line:89% align:start
At least, there's no way

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:12.721 position:38% line:83% align:start
Kenzou's
Feng Shui Assassination

00:14:12.754 --> 00:14:15.255 position:19% line:83% align:start
can attack you anymore,
despite the sacrifice for it.

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:19.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
We know it was indeed
an invincible Stand.

00:14:19.594 --> 00:14:20.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.431 position:38% line:89% align:start
F.F.! No!

00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:30.237 position:33% line:89% align:start
Preposterous.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jolyne Cujoh, what do
you think you are doing?

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:35.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
The damage your body
has suffered

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:37.612 position:19% line:83% align:start
is far more severe and
extensive than you realize!

00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:39.446 position:21% line:83% align:start
Also, you should know
by now that

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.448 position:7% line:83% align:start
the planktons inside F.F. were
already killed

00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:43.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
by the 2,800-volt shock
through them.

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:45.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
You couldn't possibly
repair that.

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:49.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne whimpers]

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.324 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] The dragon...

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:57.030 position:13% line:89% align:start
The dragon is still there!

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:59.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, if they let go
of Kenzou's hand too early,

00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:01.068 position:10% line:89% align:start
I guess this happened because

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.138 position:19% line:83% align:start
planktons can't handle
electricity like humans can.

00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:07.609 position:7% line:89% align:start
Kenzou, how is he still alive?

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:09.176 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:12.647 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.014 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:16.116 position:16% line:83% align:start

and then I'll be back

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.544 position:19% line:89% align:start
as the Founder at last.

Now, it's patently clear.

That's his safe direction.

00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:48.850 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:50.652 position:10% line:89% align:start
You were trying to figure out

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
the place Kenzou
just escaped, too.

If you can track down

00:15:54.722 --> 00:15:57.291 position:13% line:83% align:start
the actual safe spot that's
protected from all attacks,

00:15:57.324 --> 00:16:00.060 position:7% line:83% align:start
then the F.F.s that scattered,
along with the sweat

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
that they used to create
the mirror

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
should still be safe
and intact there.

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:08.937 position:5% line:83% align:start

even from the 2,800-volt surge.

you've beaten me?

that pathetic attempt?

00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:45.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're already lying

of my Feng Shui Assassination.

my Feng Shui Assassination is
definite and true.

By the way, about your legs,

00:18:50.898 --> 00:18:52.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
they look very strange.

There must be something

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
When you were
kicking Jolyne before,

00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:59.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
did they perhaps do something
to your legs?

Could it possibly be the Stand

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
that's emerging from
inside Jolyne is...

00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:15.422 position:33% line:89% align:start
Diver Drive.

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:18.458 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I'm sure it dove
into her body itself.

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:21.629 position:13% line:83% align:start
See? If a particular attack
on Jolyne has been decided,

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
then that just means
I protect her

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.067 position:13% line:83% align:start

He slipped his own powerful
Stand into my body,

00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:56.463 position:38% line:83% align:start
and then,
it permanently destroyed

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
both of Kenzou's legs
like that.

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:00.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
He basically turned
his flesh and bones
