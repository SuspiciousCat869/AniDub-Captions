was telling the truth.

is five seconds at most.

I will make this clear
once and for all.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.250 position:13% line:89% align:start
Time will keep racing by.

But, for your clarification,

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.822 position:7% line:89% align:start
I did not obtain this ability

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
just so I can dispose
of you all,

nor did I do it
to become the most powerful.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
The true purpose of
this ability

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.732 position:33% line:83% align:start
is to guide
the masses of humanity

The reason for my disposing
of you all

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:28.208 position:7% line:89% align:start
is for the future of humanity.

but to pick each of us off
one at a time.

At the exact moment

I'm gonna give you a signal.

When I do,
stop time immediately

and kill that fucker
before he gets away!

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:44.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
As for the timing,
you're gonna want to stop time

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:47.215 position:7% line:83% align:start
at precisely the same instant
that his attack hits my body!

Don't stop it any earlier
than that. Do it after.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.388 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is all
gonna happen quickly.

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.325 position:16% line:89% align:start
The timing is important.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll have to grab him
while he's in mid-attack.

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:02.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
And to do that,
your Star Platinum is the key.

Yo, wait a second.

Anastasia, that's a good idea.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.375 position:16% line:83% align:start
But although Pucchi said
he'll end you first,

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.111 position:7% line:89% align:start
he might not act on his words.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:24.118 position:10% line:83% align:start
Thinking about it a bit more
logically, he'll end me first.

that, but it isn't accurate.

With your speed,

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
you can probably catch up
to this dolphin easily.

can you keep on swimming for?

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:10.170 position:10% line:89% align:start

than a dolphin
without getting tired?

00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:17.879 position:19% line:83% align:start
That has nothing to do
with the flow of time.

00:16:17.912 --> 00:16:19.246 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's still the same distance

whether you're picking
something up or swimming.

That doesn't change!

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:24.686 position:35% line:83% align:start
And plus,
it has to be at a distance

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:27.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
where you can swim back
