00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.477 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] Wow, so this is how
the autopilot works.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:11.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
Isn't this awesome?

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.648 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't go getting
carried away now.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
Didn't the book say
there's a chance that

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.985 position:30% line:83% align:start
the helicopter
can fall out of the sky?

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.153 position:10% line:83% align:start
Emporio, it's further west.
Head that way.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you mean? If we
keep heading in this direction,

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:25.392 position:5% line:83% align:start
we'll make it to Cape Canaveral
in 30 minutes.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.294 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne]
I can sense his presence.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.163 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't really understand why,
but it feels like

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's in three or four
different locations.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
For now, head west.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm positive the priest is
somewhere near Orlando.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.038 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll just have to trust me.

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:40.742 position:35% line:89% align:start
[zooming]

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:42.209 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:46.814 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Emporio]
Something's not right.

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:48.348 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ermes grunts]

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ermes, it's my eyes, they're...

-[zooming]
-[gasps]

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.056 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Ermes] Huh?
-What the...?

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.391 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's happening to my eyes?

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.760 position:7% line:89% align:start
They're closing by themselves!

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:01.763 position:38% line:83% align:start
Jolyne,
some weird shit's going on!

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:03.363 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne groaning, screams]

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.599 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:06.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[intense dark music]
-[Ermes groans]

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:08.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] Now it's my eyelids!

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:10.905 position:19% line:89% align:start
[helicopter whirring]

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.907 position:24% line:89% align:start
I can't open them!

00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:15.208 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey Ermes, did you see
what happened?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.578 position:13% line:89% align:start
What the hell is going on?

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:17.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ermes] I don't know!

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:18.680 position:13% line:89% align:start
But one thing's for sure,

00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:20.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
there's something
in this chopper with us.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.282 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:25.853 position:10% line:89% align:start
[intense suspenseful music]

00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:28.790 position:30% line:89% align:start
[theme music]

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.783 position:5% line:83% align:start
You need to get back in control
right now, Emporio!

00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:02.617 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] Yeah, I know!

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm trying to put it
on autopilot,

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:06.087 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I can't see anything!

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
We must be under attack
by an enemy Stand!

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
But still,
what did they do to us...

00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:12.827 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne grunts]

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.697 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're tilting way to the right.
Hurry up and straighten us out!

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] I'm trying!

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:20.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
My eyelids are glued shut
and they're not opening.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.402 position:19% line:83% align:start
Something's definitely
on this thing with us!

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
[angry grunting]

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Are you sure
something's in here?

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've got my threads spread out

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.913 position:30% line:83% align:start
and nothing's
even grazing them.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.481 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's here! It must have slipped
through a small window.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.151 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] It's just moving so
damn fast and we can't feel it.

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:39.087 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.922 position:33% line:83% align:start
How the hell
is it attacking so quickly?

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
If only we knew where
the little shit was going.

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:47.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
So if we know where
it's headed, we can stop it.

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.564 position:7% line:83% align:start
We just gotta figure out which
direction it's going, right?

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.899 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's right.
There's no other way.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:52.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] Fine then.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:54.569 position:19% line:89% align:start
[helicopter whirring]

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:55.770 position:33% line:89% align:start
Okay, Ermes,

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:58.106 position:10% line:83% align:start
how fast is this thing going
right now?

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.941 position:35% line:89% align:start
170? 200?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.341 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're getting off
of this thing. Emporio!

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.849 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Ermes grunts]
What the hell?

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.318 position:24% line:89% align:start
Jolyne, you idiot!

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
What were you thinking
pulling us out of there?

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.223 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[zooming]
-[gasps]

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.761 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look, it's coming! I got
you now. Sayonara, sucker.

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.498 position:30% line:83% align:start
There it goes.
We crushed the little bastard.

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:25.199 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
[zooming]

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.436 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] Oh shit! There's more
than just one of these things!

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.672 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hang on, Ermes. I've got you!

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:33.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] I won't let us
hit the ground!

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:36.077 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

[all panting]

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] You okay, Emporio?

00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:54.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, my eyelids
are back to normal.

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.532 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] I can see again.

00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
What just happened to us?

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:02.570 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let's stay alert. The enemy's
attack is far from over.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] I saw a lot more
of them up there.

00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:07.340 position:33% line:83% align:start
And besides,
this thing ain't even a Stand.

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:08.743 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's some kind of creature.

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:09.744 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.579 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] What the hell
am I looking at?

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't know, but maybe
controlling these creatures

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.448 position:7% line:89% align:start
is the enemy Stand's ability.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.586 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hold on. Yeah. I think
I've seen one of these before.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.154 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[engine revving]
-Huh?

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:20.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.625 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rikiel] You know, before this,

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.063 position:7% line:83% align:start
I could hardly do anything for
myself. Not even drive a car.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.065 position:38% line:83% align:start
But now,
my ability to concentrate

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
is a whole lot better.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
And attacking a helicopter
is child's play.

00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:38.072 position:24% line:89% align:start
[soft tense music]

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:40.641 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] It must be him.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:42.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's one of the entities
that I've been tracking.

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:44.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is he working for the priest?

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:49.784 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Father Pucchi] Rikiel,

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:52.452 position:27% line:83% align:start
focus your mind
on the man named Dio.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.023 position:21% line:89% align:start
[breathing heavily]

00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:57.725 position:7% line:89% align:start
Center yourself and think hard

00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:59.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the bloodline
you come from.

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're one of three sons
who grew up not knowing

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:04.098 position:16% line:89% align:start
who your own father was.

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.399 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groans]
Both of my eyelids...

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:07.535 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't know why,

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.770 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they always
droop down on me randomly.

00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.404 position:27% line:89% align:start
[groaning pants]

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.440 position:7% line:89% align:start
It happens to me all the time.

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.510 position:33% line:89% align:start
My checkups,

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:20.081 position:7% line:83% align:start
the doctors claim that there's
nothing wrong with my body.

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:21.448 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's what they always say.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:24.451 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it's been happening
since I was 16.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:27.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
It all started when I was
taking my final exams.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.557 position:38% line:83% align:start
Damn it,
it was hard to breathe!

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
And everyone around me
was staring,

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
saying shit like,
"Oh, poor kid,"

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.428 position:21% line:89% align:start
or just ignoring me.

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.832 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which just made me freak out
even more!

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
After that, I stopped going
to school and never went back.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:45.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
My eyes, they're all fucked up
and I can't breathe!

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.508 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Rikiel] Oh man,
I need to wipe my palms.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're drenched with sweat.

00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:52.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
This kind of shit happens
every time I get stressed out.

00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:54.548 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Rikiel sobbing]

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.784 position:38% line:89% align:start
Rikiel.

00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:59.086 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Rikiel] I don't have any
abilities that can help you!

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.055 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not capable of anything!

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.791 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wrong. You do have an ability.

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
You just haven't
realized it yet, Rikiel.

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:09.496 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whirring]

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.066 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Live rods," have you ever
heard of organisms

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
by this name before?

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
In some regions, they are
also known as "skyfish."

00:07:16.237 --> 00:07:16.871 position:21% line:89% align:start
[breathing heavily]

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.640 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi] They are one of
those so-called

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:21.441 position:16% line:89% align:start
"unidentified species."

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.476 position:16% line:83% align:start
A group of skydivers say
they encountered them

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:26.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
while exploring a hole,
but they have no proof.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.783 position:16% line:83% align:start
Later, a TV camera crew
tried catching the rods

00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.419 position:5% line:83% align:start
but due to the remarkable speed
at which they travel,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
catching a physical form
was impossible.

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.557 position:10% line:83% align:start
Given the fact that they're
untraceable to the naked eye,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
the only way to document them
was via video camera.

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.362 position:19% line:89% align:start
So imagine my surprise

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.297 position:16% line:83% align:start
that when I was studying
your disc

00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.666 position:13% line:83% align:start
to discover what abilities
you may possess,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.703 position:7% line:83% align:start
I learned that the rods reside
here in Florida as well.

you're talking about, Father?

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:02.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
The ones up there?

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:07.188 position:7% line:89% align:start
They're here, I can see them.

[zooming]

00:08:08.456 --> 00:08:11.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now that my eyes are open,
I can see clearly.

00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:13.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
These organisms
are under my control.

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:14.729 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's my ability, right?

00:08:15.463 --> 00:08:17.398 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi]
So they were always here.

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:20.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did they just touch me?

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:23.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
No, they never physically
touched me, but...

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:24.538 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.640 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.579 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think these rod things have
been surrounding me all along.

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:33.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi] You need
to leave right away, Rikiel.

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:38.085 position:5% line:83% align:start
Your Stand is quite formidable.
I shall name it Sky Guy.

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:41.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
Research them well,
the rods' characteristics

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:42.623 position:7% line:89% align:start
and utilize them effectively.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:45.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I got it.
I feel alive again!

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:50.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Rikiel] I'm no longer a loser,

00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:52.833 position:7% line:83% align:start
panting and sticking my tongue
out like a damn dog.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.569 position:38% line:89% align:start
"Rods"?

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:58.005 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] Yeah. And if these
things really are rods,

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.608 position:10% line:83% align:start
it means that their strength
comes from what they eat.

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:02.143 position:27% line:83% align:start
These creatures
are so mysterious,

00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:03.377 position:7% line:89% align:start
no one has the slightest clue

00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:05.079 position:24% line:83% align:start
what kind of food
they feast on.

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:07.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
The unique way they fly
without ever touching anything

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.284 position:7% line:83% align:start
must have something to do with
how they hunt for their meals.

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:12.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stay here, Emporio,
we'll take care of this guy.

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.456 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Rikiel]
Yes, keep coming closer,

00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:17.925 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jolyne Cujoh and Ermes.

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.629 position:5% line:83% align:start
With the rods' precise attacks,
your bodies will be in tatters.

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just have to lure them
over here.

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:25.633 position:13% line:83% align:start
Best not to get too close
to him, Ermes.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.068 position:33% line:83% align:start
Before that,
we should learn more

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:29.236 position:21% line:83% align:start
-about his ability.
-[Rikiel gasps]

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.571 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Since he went through
the trouble of

00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:32.306 position:19% line:83% align:start
showing himself to us
like this,

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.607 position:10% line:89% align:start
his Stand's attacks must be

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:35.876 position:21% line:83% align:start
a lot more accurate
at close range.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.412 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Ermes] Yeah,
plus the jackass attacked us

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:39.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
while we were cooped up
in that chopper

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.948 position:21% line:89% align:start
with nowhere to go.

00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which probably means
his attacks ain't so accurate

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:45.119 position:10% line:83% align:start
when there's a lot of ground
for them to cover.

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.721 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Rikiel] Don't freak out.

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.490 position:13% line:83% align:start
The range of their Stands
are most likely

00:09:49.524 --> 00:09:51.358 position:13% line:89% align:start
one to two meters at most.

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:52.527 position:13% line:89% align:start
So they can't take me out

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.228 position:16% line:83% align:start
unless they come closer
to me anyway.

he deflected them in mid-air

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.048 position:13% line:89% align:start
or did anything from here.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I've got no clue
how he's doing it.

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.219 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you know, Emporio,

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:20.221 position:13% line:83% align:start

when the astronaut Armstrong

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:21.916 position:16% line:89% align:start
The day was historical.

about some dude

my life for the first time,

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
I finally realized
why it was so important.

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.871 position:13% line:89% align:start
It wasn't about the dude.

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:46.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
The moon landing was an
achievement for all humanity.

That day, we humans

[sighs]

00:12:42.263 --> 00:12:43.897 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's inside her body.

00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
The only way her ankle
could twist around like that

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:48.402 position:27% line:83% align:start
is if something
did it internally.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.870 position:16% line:89% align:start
From inside of the body.

00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:53.374 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Emporio] I see.

00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:55.843 position:5% line:83% align:start
Now I'm beginning to understand
what's happening.

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] Jolyne!
I figured out their secret.

00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:00.281 position:27% line:83% align:start
The rods survive
by feeding on body heat!

00:13:00.582 --> 00:13:01.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:02.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
The blood in my urine
means that

00:13:02.751 --> 00:13:04.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
there was an attack
to my kidney.

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:06.120 position:16% line:83% align:start
The kidney on this side
is undamaged

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.522 position:7% line:89% align:start
thanks to your father's disc,

00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:08.922 position:7% line:89% align:start
but the other side feels cold

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:10.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
because all my body heat
got sucked out.

00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:14.562 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Emporio] In the ghost room
that I used to live in,

00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:15.697 position:33% line:83% align:start
I read about
something like this

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
in one of the books
on the right shelf.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
When you look at human organs
in a thermography,

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
the diseased part
of the body's temperature

00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:24.938 position:30% line:83% align:start
is much lower
than the healthy areas.

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
If the heat in your fingers
were to be drained,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
the joints would bend
by themselves

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
and eventually start to rot.

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:33.147 position:16% line:83% align:start
Drain the heat from your
eyelids, your eyes will shut.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
And if it's drained
from your kidneys,

00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:36.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
they malfunction
and you pee blood.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
So these rods, in order
to survive, they feast on

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:43.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
other organism's body heat
and use it to fuel themselves.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.660 position:21% line:83% align:start
They come near you,
but never touch you.

00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:47.828 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you don't realize that
your body heat was absorbed

00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.330 position:10% line:89% align:start
until you've been infected.

00:13:49.363 --> 00:13:52.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yo, brat. You're a smart
little shit, aren't you.

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.202 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're exactly right.

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.937 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I didn't make
you chucklefucks sick

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
so that you would perish
from the disease.

00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:02.242 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was to make sure
you couldn't move around.

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that I can finish you
with pinpoint precision.

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:07.348 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a hard target to hit,

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.417 position:13% line:83% align:start
but there's one area where
temperature loss is fatal.

00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:13.521 position:13% line:83% align:start
The main motor and sensory
control center of the body.

00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:15.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's known as the brain stem!

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
They'll snack on the first
cervical vertebra on your neck.

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:20.729 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Rikiel] And they've locked
onto their target!

from there! Go under the water.

I've gone through

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:48.790 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:50.090 position:27% line:89% align:start

What can I target?

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.344 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which part of her body
can the rods

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:12.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
suck warmth out of

I have no clue who you are,

but I'm willing to bet

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
that if I wanna learn
where the priest is hiding,

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can just pummel

[Father Pucchi]
Center yourself and think hard

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.835 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the bloodline
you come from.

00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:35.870 position:21% line:83% align:start

[Rikiel] It's true.

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:45.780 position:21% line:83% align:start
If your entire body
is engulfed in flames,

00:15:45.814 --> 00:15:48.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
the rods don't know where
to absorb your body heat from.

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:51.251 position:10% line:89% align:start
However, if there's any way

00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:52.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
that I am going to
overcome you,

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:56.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to put myself
in the same situation!

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that I can understand
where your weaknesses are

by feeling the pain
that you're feeling!

What's the matter,

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can you not keep up
with where I'm going?

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
After the flames
overtook my body,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
I located one spot
that I could still target.

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.097 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Rikiel] And that's
the inside of your mouth,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
which you had to open
in order to take a breath.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
The hypothalamus,
which happens to be

00:16:42.637 --> 00:16:43.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
above the roof of the mouth,

00:16:43.972 --> 00:16:46.340 position:24% line:83% align:start
is also connected
to nerves in the eye.

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:48.843 position:21% line:83% align:start
And as you breathe,
the rods can enter your mouth

00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:51.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
and sap away your body heat
from inside.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
With your hypothalamus
now damaged,

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:56.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
I made it so you would
keep seeing me in places

00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:58.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
when I'm not even there

at the inside of my mouth?

Her persistence

even though
you're just saying it

filled the void within my soul.

going through a change.

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:36.303 position:16% line:83% align:start
His beliefs and the will
of the man named Dio

00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:38.740 position:19% line:83% align:start
are mixing and flowing
into his body.

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.240 position:16% line:89% align:start
And it's that spectacle

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:43.678 position:16% line:83% align:start
that's attracting us all
to Father Pucchi's side.

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:46.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everything we've done is
to guide the priest

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:48.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
and raise him up to
his ultimate destiny

You're making your way
to Cape Canaveral

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
merely to serve
the priest's desires.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
I finally realize that.

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:05.166 position:13% line:89% align:start
You said it was dumb luck.

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:07.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
You admitted
that you kept punching my face

without removing my hands
from the back of your neck

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:11.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
by coincidence, right?

00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:14.876 position:10% line:83% align:start

who the victor is.

That kind of coincidence

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.482 position:13% line:83% align:start
is exactly what the priest
is in search of.

aided you up to this moment.

backing you up in your corner.

Or was it always you?

00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:36.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm starting to believe
the priest

00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:40.001 position:16% line:83% align:start
only ever wanted someone
with fate on their side.

who's special.

00:21:53.047 --> 00:21:56.449 position:10% line:83% align:start
He must be, since the priest
took away his memories

to find where you are.

to ride without a helmet,
