[Dio] For this to work,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.614 position:27% line:83% align:start
what you need is
the power of my Stand.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.082 position:35% line:89% align:start
The World.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
Beyond the powers
my Stand shall bestow upon you,

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.888 position:10% line:89% align:start
lies the path you must travel

00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.724 position:27% line:83% align:start
in order to find
the gates of heaven.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:27.261 position:7% line:83% align:start
What you will need once on the
path is a trustworthy friend.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:31.533 position:7% line:83% align:start
Someone capable of controlling
their own selfish desires.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:37.005 position:7% line:83% align:start
A person who shares no interest
in sex, fame, wealth, or power.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.239 position:30% line:83% align:start
And above all,
they must be someone

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
who chooses the will of God
before the law of humans.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.145 position:21% line:89% align:start
The question remains.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:48.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
Will I ever cross paths
with someone like this one day?

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:50.852 position:33% line:83% align:start
Additionally,
you'll need the souls

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.854 position:19% line:89% align:start
of more than 36 humans

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
who have committed
atrocious sins.

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:57.725 position:30% line:83% align:start
That is because
those who have sinned

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.762 position:10% line:89% align:start
harbor a strong power within.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:05.065 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of equal note, there are 14
words you need to keep in mind.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
Their significance
is vital to this plan.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, I will engrave them
onto my Stand

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:12.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
to ensure that
I never forget them myself.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.277 position:19% line:83% align:start
What is most necessary
is courage.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.846 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm loathed to do so,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I must have the courage
to relinquish my Stand once.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:26.153 position:7% line:83% align:start
As it gradually disintegrates,
my Stand will take form

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
and absorb the souls
of the 36 sinners,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.060 position:24% line:83% align:start
and will give birth
to something entirely new.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.828 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whatever is born will awaken.

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.233 position:13% line:83% align:start
And once these 14 words are
uttered by my trusted friend,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
the newborn will express
a keen interest.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.813 position:30% line:83% align:start
In this moment,
my friend will trust me

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:53.748 position:27% line:83% align:start
as I'll befriend
this new entity.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.151 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lastly, you'll need
an appropriate location.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:01.589 position:30% line:83% align:start
North latitude,
28 degrees, 24 minutes,

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:04.859 position:30% line:83% align:start
west longitude,
80 degrees, 36 minutes.

00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.226 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:14.602 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go there! And wait patiently
for the next new moon.

00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:17.872 position:27% line:83% align:start
That, my friend,
is when heaven will come.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.678 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, hello there, Father!
Good morning!

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your hair's gotten longer.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
How many days
since your last visit?

00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:31.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Father Pucchi] I have
no further use for this prison.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
The child that was born
is already in my possession.

[music continues]

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:50.303 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, I simply have to wait for
my fated time to go to heaven.

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.885 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like a nightmare.

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:46.521 position:30% line:83% align:start
They've issued
a maximum class security alert.

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:48.488 position:33% line:83% align:start
Everyone here
is armed to the teeth.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:50.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the whole place
is crawling with guards.

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:51.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't even stay here
another minute.

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:56.130 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jolyne,
can you hear me at all?

00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:57.265 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you listening?

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.867 position:19% line:83% align:start
The priest is no longer
on this island.

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.769 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's already left
the Green Dolphin Street Prison

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:02.570 position:24% line:89% align:start
for who knows what.

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
But he didn't have
any belongings,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I confirm that
he wasn't carrying a baby

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.577 position:27% line:89% align:start
anywhere on him.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] I've been so bored,
I gave myself a belly ring.

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.449 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, did you bring
the disc with you?

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.719 position:10% line:89% align:start
Emporio, do you have it now?

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.223 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you contact
the Speedwagon Foundation?

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:25.126 position:30% line:83% align:start
No way I could
with such tight security.

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.261 position:33% line:83% align:start
But of course
I have the disc, Jolyne.

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:29.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
I would never leave it
lying around somewhere.

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:32.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look! I'm breaking out.

00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:36.436 position:10% line:83% align:start
According to the guards, they
think that you're the only one

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.140 position:13% line:83% align:start
who survived what happened
in the Punishment Ward.

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.209 position:13% line:89% align:start
They can't accuse you yet,

00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:42.677 position:24% line:83% align:start
but at the moment,
you're the only person

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.411 position:13% line:89% align:start
they can question about it.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:47.347 position:33% line:83% align:start
And this area
is the most heavily guarded.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.084 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you saying
you want to escape to my room?

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think you get it,
Emporio.

00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:55.422 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm talking about the prison.
I'm breaking out of this place.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.358 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't sit around here
and wait anymore.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.494 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's time! I'm getting off
of Green Dolphin Island.

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:02.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'll show me the shortcut.

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.233 position:16% line:89% align:start
I... I'll definitely call

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
the Speedwagon Foundation
for you, Jolyne.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll try my best
to get ahold of them today.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:12.372 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're missing
the big picture, Emporio.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.508 position:19% line:83% align:start
Getting Dad's disc back
was the first step.

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.345 position:7% line:83% align:start
But just because we have it now
doesn't mean this is over.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.980 position:13% line:89% align:start
If F.F. was still with us,

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:20.748 position:21% line:83% align:start
they'd already be hot
on that priest's trail.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:25.152 position:13% line:83% align:start
And now that I finally read
my father's memories,

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.888 position:35% line:83% align:start
I know what
the last 20 years mean.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.657 position:44% line:83% align:start
Also,
I understand why my father

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.526 position:21% line:83% align:start
decided to seal away
Dio's Stand ability.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.630 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fact is, my old man would
never let that priest get away.

Do you honestly plan
to stay here forever?

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:53.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ultimately, you decide,
but we can leave together.

00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.182 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't think
you're understanding.

00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:56.517 position:19% line:89% align:start
You just don't get it.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.386 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, I do get it.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
Give me three minutes and I can
destroy one of these iron bars.

But what about after that?

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:06.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no one else here
who can help you right now.

It's only me!

in his cell for some reason,

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:16.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
and won't even come to my room.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have that covered.

Nobody has been able to escape
this prison, not ever!

00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:27.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
There were inmates
who were punished severely

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.117 position:19% line:83% align:start
for even contemplating
breaking out.

00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:33.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
But anyway, unless we
can stop time like your dad,

00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:34.487 position:16% line:89% align:start
we're gonna be stuck here

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:36.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
and there's nothing
you or I can do about it.

00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:39.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't figure out what, but
there's something more to it.

00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:42.530 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean something way scarier
than the security cameras.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.633 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's almost as if the prison
itself is watching us.

Foundation first.

I would hate for us
to lose the disc

I was escaping...

By any chance, Gwess, have I...

questions over and over again?

of this room quickly!

Oh, no! I spilled my water.

00:21:19.814 --> 00:21:21.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have to pull the plug
before I die.

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:25.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm being electrocuted.

Otherwise,
I can't leave this room

00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:32.927 position:27% line:83% align:start
through that exit
and meet Jolyne.

00:21:37.932 --> 00:21:39.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
I won't be able to see her.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.576 position:13% line:83% align:start
I remember seeing something
like that on Jolyne's arm

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:50.578 position:10% line:89% align:start
right before I wiped it off.

00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:52.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suppose I'll have
to confirm it, though.

00:21:53.581 --> 00:21:55.382 position:30% line:83% align:start
Still, no one's
escaping from here.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:56.884 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's an airtight fortress.
