[Father Pucchi]
The bone of my dear friend.

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.812 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Great Dio.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.947 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Pale Snake]
What the hell is this?

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:16.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
The bone! Huh!
Where did it go?

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.486 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm asking you where his bone
went! You'd best answer me!

[groans in pain]

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.089 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sports Maximum]
I can feel the bone's presence

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.491 position:16% line:83% align:start
at the Maximum Security
Disciplinary Wing,

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:25.860 position:24% line:89% align:start
right as we speak.

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:28.295 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? Did Jolyne make it

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
so she can go to
the Discipline Cell

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.166 position:10% line:83% align:start
just to find that same bone
belonging to Dio?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.737 position:41% line:83% align:start
Yeah,
but it's way too reckless!

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.872 position:7% line:89% align:start
If I get my hands on it first,

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
that creepy Pale Snake
will soon follow.

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:44.144 position:13% line:83% align:start
Also, there's my father's
stolen memory disc

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
that the bastard's
still holding onto.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.414 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:52.052 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.758 position:13% line:83% align:start
Where is that little guy?
I have to find him.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.358 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's the one
who's got the bone.

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:02.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, where would he
be hiding?

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.632 position:7% line:83% align:start
Before someone beats me there
and knocks him off,

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
and I lose the bone forever.

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:09.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
-No, I have to get it
at all costs.

[groans]

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.280 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait! What the...?

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
No! Please tell me
the shit didn't already happen.

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:25.820 position:38% line:83% align:start
Please!
The battle is already over.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.088 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're all disfigured
and bloated.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
Every last body in
the Discipline Cell is fucked.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.193 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's a Stand power.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:36.229 position:5% line:83% align:start
Holy shit! How many Stand Users
are in this place?

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.803 position:24% line:83% align:start
Were they the ones
who did this?

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:44.839 position:7% line:89% align:start
And what exactly did they do?

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.778 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] But one User can have
only one Stand power.

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:53.213 position:16% line:83% align:start
The person that defeated
all the prisoners here

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.283 position:33% line:83% align:start
can only be
one of these two punks I see.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
Obviously, they sent
a shit ton more Stand Users

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.022 position:33% line:83% align:start
to this ward
than I assumed before.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:02.991 position:24% line:83% align:start
At the very least,
there's still a Stand User

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:05.192 position:27% line:83% align:start
that stimulates
the human conscious

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.127 position:30% line:83% align:start
and makes them
want to fight in here.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can you stand
with that gaping wound?

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your Stand is intriguing,
my dear.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:22.442 position:24% line:83% align:start
A Stand of string!
Who would've thought?

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.143 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.712 position:13% line:89% align:start
I also find it interesting

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:27.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
that your combat moves
are completely unpredictable.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.852 position:16% line:83% align:start
Most interesting of all,
however,

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:33.420 position:7% line:89% align:start
is your dogged determination.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.757 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's obvious
you've been gravely wounded,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.959 position:7% line:83% align:start
but I can tell you've already
grown much

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
from that brutal fight
just now.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:42.496 position:16% line:83% align:start
When Pale Snake told me
that he sent

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
four Stand Users here,
including me,

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.101 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was taken aback because
I'm sure you can imagine.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:50.672 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I thought "Are that many
necessary to accomplish this?"

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.742 position:16% line:83% align:start
But now, the reason why
is totally obvious.

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
If he wants to eliminate you
for good,

00:02:57.712 --> 00:02:59.714 position:19% line:89% align:start
which he clearly does.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:04.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
By the way, I am Kenzou,
a spritely 78 years old.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:07.287 position:19% line:83% align:start
The key to good health
is eight hours of deep sleep,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.191 position:10% line:83% align:start
and of course, urine therapy
every day without fail.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:14.261 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's important
to maintain good habits.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.998 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you familiar with it?
Urine therapy!

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:18.265 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.472 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] If you wanna play,
I'll gladly take you on.

-I can do an American style.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.610 position:13% line:89% align:start
Or how about French style?

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:31.746 position:21% line:89% align:start
Japanese-style work?

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:36.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
And of course
Italian Naples style.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.352 position:7% line:83% align:start
All around the world, there's
a finger that says "Fuck you."

["STONE OCEAN"

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:23.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll get straight
to the point, dear.

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:26.661 position:10% line:83% align:start
All the dead you see didn't
just die, they were drowned.

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:29.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
I drowned them, that's why
their bodies are bloated

00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:31.999 position:5% line:83% align:start
and look like giant human ticks
about to explode.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:33.466 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps softly]

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:34.769 position:13% line:89% align:start
And regrettably, it seems

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:38.539 position:7% line:83% align:start
my first opponent is not you,
or it is not yet.

[both gasp]

00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:54.387 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damn! They caught me moving

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.957 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the shadows
of the bloated bodies?

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.258 position:21% line:89% align:start
I thought I had him.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.060 position:33% line:83% align:start
So much for
my grand coup the main.

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:00.595 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, and how convenient.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.763 position:27% line:83% align:start
A corpse somehow
blocked my F.F. bullets.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:06.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sinister laughter]
Yes, it was close, indeed.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.302 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wait a sec!
How did you get here, F.F.?

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:10.037 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it!

00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.274 position:7% line:83% align:start
But, damn! I got to say it was
a pretty close call, Jolyne.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.343 position:21% line:83% align:start
And before you lose
any more blood,

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.078 position:10% line:89% align:start
you gotta fill those wounds.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.892 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah! I remember now.

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:34.262 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think I saw him with Weather
Forecast at Emporio's place.

[Kenzou] Sweat...

00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:57.852 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's dripping down.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you going
to open your mouth?

[both gasp]

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:09.130 position:7% line:83% align:start
Or would you prefer to drown?
Is that it?

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.497 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you mean "drown"?

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.266 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
what stupid plan you've got,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.568 position:7% line:89% align:start
but actually, water is my jam.

00:07:14.602 --> 00:07:15.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you think you can...

00:07:18.673 --> 00:07:20.041 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:23.044 position:7% line:83% align:start
For a trained person to drown
under these circumstances,

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:26.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
it usually takes anywhere
between five to seven minutes.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.648 position:10% line:89% align:start
But only if they draw breath

00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:29.449 position:10% line:83% align:start
deep enough to leave oxygen
in the lungs,

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.619 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's what buys them
that precious time.

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:32.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
-If all the oxygen...
-[muffled drowning]

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:34.522 position:7% line:89% align:start
...in both lungs were exhaled,

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:37.291 position:27% line:83% align:start
that would have
a far less enjoyable outcome.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.427 position:38% line:83% align:start
You see,
with only a few drops of water,

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
a human will just drown
and then die instantly.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:45.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
Siphoned directly
from your filthy mouth,

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
I damaged your fourth
cervical spine vertebrae.

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's a large nerve that
connects right to your kidney!

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.807 position:13% line:89% align:start
When one is under duress,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.443 position:24% line:83% align:start
the adrenal gland
secretes bodily fluid

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.379 position:10% line:83% align:start
into the respiratory mucosa
like a lubricant.

00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:00.514 position:10% line:89% align:start
So these few drops of water

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:02.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
should evoke a feeling
of being suffocated

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.819 position:7% line:89% align:start
by a giant wave. Huh, lovely!

00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:09.623 position:24% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Oh my god!
I can't breathe.

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.959 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm inside
a normal human's body.

00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:13.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
Atroe, I'm losing!

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.630 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is bad,
my body can't take it!

00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.066 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kenzou laughs]

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
F.F.! No!
[grunts]

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:23.537 position:35% line:89% align:start
[choking]

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.943 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you want to drown, too?
I'm glad to help out.

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:30.211 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:32.646 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Jolyne Cujoh!
-[grunts]

00:08:35.249 --> 00:08:36.684 position:35% line:89% align:start
[rumbling]

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:41.589 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:44.892 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gun shots]

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:47.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
Hiyah!

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:49.296 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.568 position:30% line:83% align:start
What are you?
Identify yourself.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.103 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are you a human?

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:58.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
[coughs, breathes heavily]

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] Don't get up.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:04.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's safer and wiser
to observe them from here.

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
What kind of Stand User
is that old geezer, anyway?

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should be evaluating
his strengths right now.

00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:11.685 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wouldn't you say?

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:15.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
The main problem here, you see,

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:18.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
is not the old man's ability
to drown other people,

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:21.996 position:24% line:83% align:start
but the fact that
he dodged bullets.

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
Perhaps it's trite,

00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:26.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
but why aren't any of those
well-aimed shots hitting him?

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:29.136 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's a far more
dangerous detail.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.006 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why'd you come here?
And what was your name again?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
Anastasia or...
something prissy?

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.912 position:21% line:89% align:start
Because I love you,

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:40.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I've been dying
to see your face again.

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:41.282 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.151 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hah? What did you just say?

00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:48.889 position:19% line:83% align:start
That old man has been
locked up here a while.

00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:51.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's served 40 years
at this prison.

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:54.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
He's a lunatic who enjoys
drinking his own piss.

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:57.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
It had been ages since I'd
seen him in the men's ward.

00:09:57.398 --> 00:09:59.600 position:30% line:83% align:start
It turned out
he was here all along.

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now this decaying
freakshow is a Stand User.

00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:04.405 position:21% line:89% align:start
In the fall of 1969,

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:06.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
he killed 34 young men
and women.

00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:09.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was sentenced to
280 years in prison,

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:11.679 position:30% line:83% align:start
equivalent of
several lifetimes.

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:17.885 position:13% line:83% align:start
That grinning gray carcass
was only 37 back then.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:20.387 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] He claimed to be
the guru of a secret cult.

00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:21.822 position:16% line:83% align:start
And he was so successful
that he even had

00:10:21.856 --> 00:10:25.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hollywood stars in his
bizarre little fringe group.

00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:26.894 position:21% line:83% align:start
But their activities
led to issues

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.531 position:10% line:83% align:start
between his rabid followers
and outside society,

00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:31.966 position:19% line:83% align:start
so the police and FBI
started to get involved.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.902 position:7% line:89% align:start
He knew he was fully cornered,

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:38.405 position:7% line:83% align:start
so he and 34 of his followers
holed up in a Florida villa,

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:40.174 position:5% line:89% align:start
and planned out a mass suicide.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.911 position:30% line:83% align:start
But it wasn't
quite that simple.

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:46.581 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kenzou drugged his followers
so they would pass out,

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:48.949 position:33% line:83% align:start
then he set
the building on fire.

00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:51.352 position:13% line:83% align:start
You see, all the believers
burnt to death,

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:53.154 position:10% line:89% align:start
except for one sole survivor

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.289 position:16% line:83% align:start
who just happened to be
the cult leader.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:58.759 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia]
It was just dumb luck, really.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:01.328 position:10% line:83% align:start
Strangely, it seems the wall
of the building nearest him

00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:03.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
collapsed in such a way
that partly shielded him

00:11:03.632 --> 00:11:05.466 position:13% line:89% align:start
from the smoke and flames.

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:06.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is no doubt, though,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
that he was indeed
willing to die,

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:11.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
since he was near death
when they found him.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's my point
in telling you all this?

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:16.744 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.
I've digressed a bit.

00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
But the fact is
only he survived.

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:20.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
He'll never get released
from prison,

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:22.850 position:16% line:83% align:start
but he wasn't sentenced
to death, either.

00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:26.053 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is the reality behind him.

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
[exhales softly]

00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:29.056 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathes heavily]

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've never seen you before
and I don't know who you are.

00:11:31.926 --> 00:11:33.394 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I can see
your point of strength

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:34.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
as though you're made of glass,

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:37.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
the secret of the power
that lies within you.

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:39.266 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's patently clear
that what flows

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.536 position:24% line:83% align:start
what flows through
every artery in your body

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.804 position:33% line:83% align:start
is very much
something other than blood.

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:46.240 position:19% line:83% align:start
Am I seeing the source
of your Stand in action?

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.976 position:38% line:83% align:start
Or is it
a different organism entirely?

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:52.046 position:7% line:83% align:start
Either way, it will not affect
how I'm gonna finish you off.

00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.882 position:16% line:83% align:start
In terms of vital points
and body composition,

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
you're essentially no different
than a normal human being.

00:11:57.418 --> 00:11:59.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
In the end, you will
shed blood, just the same.

00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:03.490 position:16% line:89% align:start
I assume by your stance,

00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:05.059 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're ready to drown
once again.

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:07.562 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just be aware,
you won't survive this time.

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:08.429 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:12.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
West-southwest,
225 degrees, 0 minutes.

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:16.770 position:13% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] Yeah, there it is.

00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:18.772 position:27% line:83% align:start
He put something
on his hands again.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:20.007 position:19% line:89% align:start
What the hell is that?

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what's with
that weird slinky crab walk?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.979 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[grunts]
-Hmm.

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:26.548 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, how utterly fascinating.

00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:29.216 position:38% line:83% align:start
It seems
your dragon's direction is...

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.484 position:24% line:89% align:start
[breathes shortly]

00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:35.889 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:37.958 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:12:37.992 --> 00:12:40.494 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, F.F.,
he's right behind you!

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.165 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! Don't attack me!

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:48.035 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're just wasting
your time, truly!

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:48.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:03.284 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! Don't attack me!

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:06.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're just wasting
your time, truly!

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:06.787 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:11.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you, your real
enemy is that insane old man,

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.461 position:16% line:83% align:start
so stop shooting at me.
Don't you get it yet?

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:16.363 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm impervious. An illusion.

00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:19.166 position:33% line:83% align:start
Your attacks
will only pass through me.

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.368 position:30% line:83% align:start
Eyes forward!
Danger approaches.

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:22.369 position:13% line:89% align:start
He's coming right at you!

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:25.939 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have no right to interfere.

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:30.110 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's only that old man.
He's your enemy. Destroy him!

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:31.945 position:10% line:89% align:start
[F.F.] What... What is this?

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.347 position:27% line:83% align:start
The reason that
old sack of shit

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
can dodge bullets
is because of him?

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:37.652 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here he comes.

00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:38.852 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-Hiyah!

00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:43.190 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[yells]
-[Kenzou] Hey-hey-hey!

00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:45.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
This guy is 78?

00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:48.062 position:13% line:83% align:start
How does the walking dead
kick and punch so fast?

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:50.497 position:24% line:83% align:start
To quote a phrase,
I can now enter the dragon.

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:52.099 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hiyah!

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:55.836 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:13:57.572 --> 00:13:58.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.843 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jolyne] What is he?

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:05.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
He tore his own arm off,
but... why would he?

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.150 position:38% line:83% align:start
No way!
Now, his arm is flying

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:11.619 position:24% line:83% align:start
right to the back
of F.F.'s head.

00:14:11.653 --> 00:14:12.853 position:33% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Ugh!
[grunts]

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.058 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shit! That was close.

00:14:18.092 --> 00:14:20.994 position:10% line:83% align:start
But still, F.F. blocked it.
That was so badass!

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:24.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
I noticed as soon as Kenzou
touched that dragon Stand,

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:26.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
his arm disappeared
at that same moment.

00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:29.236 position:19% line:83% align:start
A smoked screen so we
won't see his attack coming.

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:38.112 position:10% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Oh, shit! What's that
dragon behind him now?

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
When you touch it,
does your other arm tear off?

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just like the User,
the attack was weak.

00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:44.918 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, F.F.!

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:47.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
This battle's result
is already decided.

00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:49.758 position:10% line:89% align:start
But it's not like anyone can

00:14:49.791 --> 00:14:51.325 position:27% line:83% align:start
actually predict
what happens, though.

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:54.829 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hiyah! And you, pipe down!
You talked too much.

00:14:54.863 --> 00:14:56.029 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why would you
give away everything?

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.098 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to be neutral!
Remember that?

00:14:58.132 --> 00:15:00.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Drake's Dream] You're
operating in bad faith, though.

00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:02.771 position:30% line:83% align:start
You must share

way that was a coincidence.

That inmate's glasses
flew straight at F.F.

and lodged themselves
in her face?

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.182 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unfortunate direction.
[sighs]

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:50.652 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm starting to understand.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.219 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's feng shui in action.

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.053 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.590 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's geomancy
for the East Asians.

00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.224 position:16% line:89% align:start
Watch Kenzou's movements

00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:59.393 position:21% line:83% align:start
as if he's adjusting
to a certain direction.

00:15:59.426 --> 00:16:03.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
Attacks coming from there, one
direction as if pre-determined,

00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:06.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
and that Stand on his hand,
it just works.

00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:09.637 position:5% line:83% align:start
The only conclusion to be drawn
is, with that dragon Stand,

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:12.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kenzou can perfectly control
the direction of his attacks.

00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:15.777 position:16% line:89% align:start
Feng shui? What is that?

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.478 position:21% line:83% align:start
And what do you mean
by direction?

00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:19.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll explain.

00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:23.350 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's as famous as astrology and
tarot card reading, maybe more,

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:25.887 position:7% line:89% align:start
but it's not fortune telling.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.623 position:19% line:83% align:start
East Asian philosophy
highlights the idea

00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:31.191 position:10% line:83% align:start
that there are natural paths
of energy in the natural world

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.093 position:27% line:83% align:start
such as the flow
of wind and water.

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
By knowing the direction
in which nature is flowing,

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.233 position:19% line:83% align:start
it helps people choose
similar paths for their lives.

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:40.735 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Anastasia] Here's an example.

00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:42.236 position:7% line:89% align:start
Feng shui is used to determine

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:45.205 position:19% line:83% align:start
the good and bad areas
of the land, house, and room.

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:47.842 position:21% line:83% align:start
If the direction of
the land or house is bad,

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
it will affect
the resident's health,

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:53.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
fortune and even the whole
family's well-being negatively.

00:16:53.848 --> 00:16:55.650 position:10% line:89% align:start
In times of war, it is said

00:16:55.683 --> 00:16:57.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
that they checked
the feng shui of the castle

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:59.386 position:13% line:89% align:start
and thus, could determine

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:01.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
the most advantageous area
of the fortress

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:03.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
they could attack from
to bring down the enemy.

00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:05.225 position:24% line:89% align:start
On the other hand,

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you build a shrine
in the weak zone of the castle,

00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:10.130 position:10% line:89% align:start
it can calm the evil energy.

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:13.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
The castle will gain a
furthermore solidified defense.

00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:17.539 position:5% line:83% align:start
And of course, this same theory
of feng shui

00:17:17.572 --> 00:17:19.707 position:21% line:83% align:start
can also be applied
to human bodies.

00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:22.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's even an attack
called feng shui assassination.

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:23.978 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:24.012 --> 00:17:25.412 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you can control
the direction

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:27.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
from which to attack
your enemy,

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:30.518 position:16% line:83% align:start
you're almost guaranteed
a victory over them.

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:33.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter how alert
and prepared the target is,

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:35.890 position:5% line:83% align:start
you'll be able to approach them
without being noticed,

00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:37.926 position:33% line:83% align:start
leaving them
completely vulnerable,

00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:39.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
and you can easily
assassinate them.

00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:41.194 position:30% line:89% align:start
That means...

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:44.231 position:19% line:89% align:start
...unlucky direction.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:45.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] I think
we've now established

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.735 position:7% line:89% align:start
the secret of Kenzou's Stand.

00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:51.204 position:24% line:83% align:start
The unlucky course
pointing straight toward F.F.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:54.008 position:7% line:83% align:start
That dragon Stand is pointing
out the precise direction

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:55.843 position:16% line:83% align:start
for Kenzou to kill them
fast and easy.

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:58.378 position:10% line:89% align:start
And at some point very soon,

00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.748 position:19% line:83% align:start
his attack will merge
with that floating dragon.

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:04.052 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid F.F.'s fate
has already been decided.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:05.987 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't believe Kenzou.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.989 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's spent the last 40 years
in prison

00:18:08.022 --> 00:18:10.157 position:16% line:83% align:start
mastering the feng shui
assassination,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
and that skill developed
as his Stand power.

00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:16.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] Feng shui!

00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:21.002 position:19% line:89% align:start
That would explain it.

00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:22.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why not one
of the bullets

00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:23.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
hit the old man, either.

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:25.172 position:30% line:89% align:start
Unbelievable!

00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:28.375 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying the feng shui
also protected him

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:30.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
as well as helped him
try to kill them?

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:32.212 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I am.

[Anastasia] When he holds
that dragon Stand in his hands,

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:37.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
he reads which direction
is the best to take.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
And while moving
in that direction,

00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:44.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
he simultaneously
launches his attack.

00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:47.595 position:10% line:83% align:start
The dragon is trying to show
the direct line to kill again.

F.F.! Wait!

deliberately made

to shoot right into your face.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:53.233 position:19% line:89% align:start

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.803 position:10% line:83% align:start

to that dragon.

no fucking sense to me, either.

But seriously,
whatever you do,

00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:02.175 position:21% line:83% align:start
you can't allow him

00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:29.964 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just so you know,
that's the same move

00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:31.364 position:5% line:89% align:start
I employed in my attack before.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.769 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're about to get beaten
senseless by your very own arm.

Yes, that did just happen.

My Stand attack has merged
with the course of your death.

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:55.322 position:13% line:83% align:start
You asshole! What the hell
was that nightmare?

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:57.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
I lost my arm just then.
Are you responsible for that?

00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:01.829 position:7% line:83% align:start
I told you there's an unlucky
direction. I'm very sorry!

00:21:01.863 --> 00:21:04.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's caused by
the direction's certain power.

00:21:04.464 --> 00:21:06.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have no way of knowing

00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:07.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
what's gonna happen
in the next moment.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if I were you,
young lady,

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.205 position:7% line:89% align:start
I would try my best to prevent

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:12.940 position:33% line:83% align:start
or minimize
the inevitable damage.

F.F.! Hurry up
and get out of there!

It's been destroyed
by the meteor.

00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:46.874 position:10% line:89% align:start
The fan's gonna fall on you.

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:57.317 position:13% line:83% align:start
Actually, what you have to
worry about is not the fan.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's the metal boomerang
heading towards you.
