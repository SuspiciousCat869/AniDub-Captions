[beeping]

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:14.716 position:7% line:83% align:start
[researcher] He's currently in
a deep REM sleep,

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.784 position:13% line:89% align:start
and has been for some time.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.990 position:16% line:83% align:start
He woke up in the posture
like an ascetic monk.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
And when it seemed like
he might be awake,

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
he went back to sleep
for 24 hours.

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.096 position:33% line:89% align:start
Makes sense,

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
since he has zero memory
to speak of.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
How are his learning and
cognitive skills

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:34.802 position:21% line:89% align:start
after being revived?

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.470 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're all normal.

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:38.272 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's even memorized
30 English words.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.275 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, he doesn't seem
to know

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.143 position:19% line:83% align:start
or understand his name
as Jotaro Cujoh.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.314 position:24% line:89% align:start
As for his family,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
he shows no reaction, not even
to a picture of his daughter.

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.158 position:30% line:83% align:start
His EEG and EKG
read as normal, too.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:02.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, his muscle values
are on the decline.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.998 position:24% line:83% align:start
Having no memories
would indicate

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.166 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he naturally has
no motivation

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.436 position:30% line:83% align:start
to go on living
as the mind is shutting down.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.473 position:7% line:83% align:start
In response, the muscles begin
to deteriorate quickly.

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.110 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, doctor.
What's the plan?

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:19.446 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't know yet.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.348 position:35% line:83% align:start
We may have
no other choice here

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.283 position:24% line:83% align:start
than to try and get
his memories back.

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:24.786 position:24% line:89% align:start
[researcher gasps]

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.989 position:33% line:83% align:start
Doctor, wait!
Don't touch his head!

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:28.790 position:27% line:89% align:start
[glass shatters]

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:33.528 position:33% line:83% align:start
He's injured!
Get him some first aid!

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:38.332 position:10% line:83% align:start
I apologize, doctor. I forgot
to warn you about that before.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did he just release
his Stand power?

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:43.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes! However, it's actually
not from his memory,

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:45.873 position:35% line:83% align:start
but rather
an instinct of defense.

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.145 position:24% line:89% align:start
It says "Jo...lyne"

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.848 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait! "Jolyne"?

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:54.882 position:35% line:89% align:start
No! No way!

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.385 position:16% line:89% align:start
It couldn't possibly say!

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
[pensive music playing]

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.363 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jotaro] I want you to know...

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.066 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want you to know

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.503 position:16% line:83% align:start
you are always incredibly
important to me.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.375 position:35% line:83% align:start
Holy shit!
Look at the wounds on your arm.

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:25.212 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even though I treated them,
even though I healed them.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:28.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
They've formed shapes that
spell something out. Clearly.

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:31.919 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll try healing them again.

00:02:32.587 --> 00:02:33.521 position:38% line:89% align:start
No! Wait!

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't want you to heal this.

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:38.559 position:21% line:89% align:start
[F.F. exhales softly]

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:40.862 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] I have no way
to explain it,

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:41.896 position:33% line:89% align:start
but I know...

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is... a message
sent from my dad.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.636 position:10% line:89% align:start
Since before I was even born,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
that man has been
watching over so many things.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
To keep Mama and I
from being involved

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:56.044 position:21% line:83% align:start
in scenarios exactly
like the ones

00:02:56.077 --> 00:02:57.645 position:10% line:89% align:start
that are going on right now.

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
He made sure to keep
his distance,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
knowing that'd help me
stay safe.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, just now, I felt it.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.456 position:7% line:83% align:start
I believe that through my body,
my dad speaks to me.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.588 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hey, F.F.
-What?

00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:50.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, could you maybe hook
Jolyne's leg on the stairs?

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:53.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
That'll make her slow down
a little bit and trip.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
You want me to do what now?

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:57.430 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like I said,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want her to trip,
but it's not what you think.

00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:02.003 position:13% line:83% align:start
I won't actually allow her
to fall down.

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.806 position:24% line:83% align:start
You see, as soon as
she stumbles,

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to catch her
in my arms.

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:07.708 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.011 position:24% line:89% align:start
The thing is she...

00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:11.646 position:16% line:89% align:start
might not understand that

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:14.615 position:16% line:83% align:start
she was protected earlier
because of me.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:18.451 position:10% line:83% align:start
What I desire is to feel her
in my embrace again.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.788 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, go do it now!

00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:23.291 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Come on! Just trip her.
-Sexual harassment and assault?

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's on you, buddy.

00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:28.229 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll tell you again. I'm going
to make Jolyne my wife.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.531 position:27% line:83% align:start
And you are going
to help me with that.

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:33.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you the sort of person
who breaks their promises?

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.036 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.807 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, do it!

00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:40.373 position:33% line:89% align:start
[F.F. sighs]

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:44.011 position:16% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] I'm sorry, Jolyne,
but I have to.

00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:47.380 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.250 position:19% line:89% align:start
I caught the small man!

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:50.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
He must have been
spying on us

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:52.553 position:21% line:83% align:start
from the floor above
the whole time.

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's it! He's holding the
bone in his hand, right there!

[F.F.] Oh, he sure is

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
a slippery little fucker,
isn't he?

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:12.073 position:19% line:89% align:start
But he won't escape me!

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.075 position:38% line:89% align:start
No! Wait!

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:16.210 position:27% line:83% align:start
Something's wrong
with his back.

[mumbling continues]

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.451 position:21% line:83% align:start
You said earlier that
he was a small man, right?

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.954 position:38% line:83% align:start
He indeed
fit that category before.

00:06:26.988 --> 00:06:30.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But now, he's somehow...

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.998 position:30% line:83% align:start
As tall as me.
No, even taller, in fact.

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, you're cornered.
No more running away!

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:41.602 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now, face me nice and slow.

[F.F.] What the hell?

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
His head literally
just exploded.

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.648 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
he's a Stand User?

00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:29.550 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just stay away. No,
it doesn't look like a Stand.

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:32.485 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't know what it is,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.487 position:24% line:83% align:start
but whatever we do,
we shouldn't touch him.

[gasps]
Shit! Where'd the bone go?

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:37.959 position:13% line:89% align:start
He was holding it earlier.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.860 position:30% line:83% align:start
What happened?
We have to find it.

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:07:56.344 --> 00:07:57.578 position:35% line:89% align:start
Holy crap!

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:59.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's happening
to the other inmates, too?

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:04.685 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're undeniably turning
into plants.

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:06.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
They appear to still
be growing, too.

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
But why? What's happening
to them all?

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:09.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who could have done this?

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.593 position:21% line:83% align:start
What possible reason
could anyone have?

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.733 position:13% line:83% align:start
[D an' G] Perhaps, I should
think of this

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:20.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
as a Stand power as well.

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:23.004 position:33% line:89% align:start
Of the bone.

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:26.207 position:13% line:83% align:start
It seems like the power and
will fueling this phenomenon,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
is, in so doing, attempting

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:29.910 position:16% line:83% align:start

You realize
he could be an enemy!

Well, is that true? Are you
an enemy and not telling us?

I already said it's fine.

Stand up, Guccio. You can
at least do that, can't you?

All right, you're free to go.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:40.340 position:7% line:83% align:start
What was that? So, is that guy
an enemy or isn't he?

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:43.143 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] Frankly, that's of
no importance to me at all.

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:45.145 position:30% line:83% align:start
The only thing
I'm interested in now

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.815 position:24% line:83% align:start
is if we can safely
get out of here

00:15:46.848 --> 00:15:47.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
from the East side
of the building.

Are we agreed?

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.119 position:19% line:89% align:start
We should want safety.

00:15:57.525 --> 00:15:58.959 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should make that
our exit point.

How did it ever come
to this?

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:10.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had only the barest
of information.

00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:12.907 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have one job and it's simple.

00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:15.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
Get rid of Jolyne Cujoh
permanently.

00:16:15.543 --> 00:16:16.711 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's all I'm here for.

00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:19.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just have to make sure
I do that.

Where did Jolyne
and those other two fools go?

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did they possibly manage
to escape and I missed them?

00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:35.295 position:7% line:83% align:start
No! There's no way they can get
outside without my seeing them.

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:42.402 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, I asked you a question.

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:26.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Guccio] That was
an awful experience.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.018 position:7% line:83% align:start
Pale Snake told me to make them
fight using Survivor,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.353 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I'm pretty sure I did that,
but what really matters now is

00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:36.223 position:33% line:89% align:start
yay, finally,

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.058 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can go outside
and be in the sun.

00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:48.302 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jolyne] That was close,
but it looks like

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:51.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
we made a clean getaway
from the other Stand User.

I guess it was
a temporary thing, anyway.

00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:57.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Anastasia] The bigger problem
to worry about

00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
is that at any minute,

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.415 position:19% line:83% align:start

to realize

00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:03.051 position:27% line:83% align:start
what happened at
this Discipline Ward.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.552 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's better for us.

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:05.587 position:24% line:89% align:start
Because if they do,

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.455 position:10% line:83% align:start
Pale Snake will realize that
at the same time.

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:10.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
And he'll come out
and show his ugly face,

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:12.927 position:24% line:83% align:start

blow him off the map.

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:05.566 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a throttle lever, Master.
Here, let me show you! Huh!

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you want to get it in gear,

00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:09.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
you must shift it
in neutral first. Like so!

00:21:10.104 --> 00:21:12.874 position:35% line:89% align:start
[rumbling]

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:13.541 position:16% line:89% align:start
This stick is the rudder.

00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:14.776 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you push it forward,

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:17.745 position:30% line:83% align:start
the empennage,
or tail assembly, turns right.

00:21:17.779 --> 00:21:20.748 position:10% line:83% align:start
Pull it back, it turns to the
left. Simple as that! Ready?

00:21:20.782 --> 00:21:21.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, untie the anchor rope,
weirdo.

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:23.618 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, right away, Master.

00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:33.293 position:10% line:83% align:start
[F.F.] Jolyne, don't you dare
take your eyes off that Stand.

00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.597 position:19% line:89% align:start
[ominous music playing]

00:21:40.802 --> 00:21:43.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
As long as you got him
under your watch,

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.438 position:7% line:89% align:start
he'll be an excellent servant.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:49.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perfect, even! He's creepy,
but he'll be useful.

00:21:50.511 --> 00:21:52.947 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
if you give him any leeway...

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.518 position:38% line:83% align:start
[choking]
Fuck!

00:21:57.552 --> 00:21:59.687 position:38% line:83% align:start
[choking]
It's son of a bitch!

00:22:00.655 --> 00:22:01.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is way worse
than I imagined.

00:22:03.157 --> 00:22:07.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
[breathes heavily]
Jolyne, Anastasia!

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't take your eyes
off this monster for a second.

00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:12.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
