Yeah. To distract us from

you said just now?

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:27.982 position:33% line:83% align:start
Did you say,
"Star Platinum"?

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.216 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's my Stand.

Jolyne, how would
you know that?

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:35.188 position:21% line:89% align:start
From what I can tell,

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
it only became reality

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
after I told you
about Johngalli A.

there's no way you could've
seen my power yet.

its existence

since you're my child,

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
there's no way
you should know

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:49.871 position:16% line:89% align:start
the name "Star Platinum."

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:54.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
That would be inconsistent!

Were you dreaming too?

00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:26.841 position:10% line:89% align:start
No, I've been in a nightmare.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.643 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then I woke up to all of this.

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:30.511 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I see.

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:33.781 position:19% line:83% align:start

Can you move?

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.360 position:21% line:83% align:start
The current situation
could be a dream...

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.396 position:21% line:89% align:start
within another dream.

then it's reality.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.104 position:27% line:89% align:start
A harsh reality.

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:57.772 position:24% line:83% align:start

not escape.

Just a bit more.

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:38.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bring it a little closer
to me.

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
It would be for the best

a little further to my left.

The window is just down this

From the window to the shore

But thank you.

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:46.293 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can stand up on my own

That isn't it.

this was important,

You're always thinking
everything through

calmly and logically.

you couldn't be bothered
to come for see me.

Or when I was doing
a little joy-riding,

Don't drop it.

A transmitter has been
fitted inside of the pendant,

The submarine has
been programmed

If you're talking about me,
that is.

00:20:23.256 --> 00:20:24.224 position:41% line:89% align:start
[cocks]

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.095 position:24% line:89% align:start
[guard] You bitch!

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:28.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hold on, don't shoot!

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:29.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
She has her hands up.

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:32.800 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Yeah, but--
-Do not fire. She's unarmed.

00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:35.335 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you surrender?

00:20:38.172 --> 00:20:40.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
But there should be
another person.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
The tall man with the cap
who came to visit her!

00:20:43.211 --> 00:20:45.245 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's close! Go find him!

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.552 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. That's where you were.

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.960 position:7% line:89% align:start
[boy] Why? Tell me why, Jolyne?

00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:01.028 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why didn't you run?

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:02.730 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a tragedy,

00:21:02.764 --> 00:21:04.932 position:30% line:83% align:start
but your father
is already as good as dead.

00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:11.038 position:21% line:83% align:start
His powers were taken
by that weird, mushy guy.

00:21:11.072 --> 00:21:13.941 position:10% line:83% align:start
You barely survived the trap
he set for your father!

00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:15.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
So why?

00:21:15.475 --> 00:21:16.978 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why didn't you escape?

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:20.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because the one who did it
went back inside.

00:21:20.915 --> 00:21:22.650 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not outside, but inside!

00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:23.618 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:25.853 position:16% line:83% align:start
The culprit's goal relies
on their ability

00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:28.956 position:16% line:83% align:start
to steal people's Stands
by making them materialize.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.224 position:24% line:89% align:start
That mushy bastard

00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:32.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
deliberately went
back inside of the prison.

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:34.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
They didn't try to
make a run for it,

00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:35.897 position:27% line:83% align:start
so they must have
what they need

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.864 position:24% line:89% align:start
inside the prison.

00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.666 position:33% line:89% align:start
And so what?

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:40.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't possibly think
you can get it back.

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:42.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you really think your dad

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:43.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
will come back to life
if you do?

00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.807 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's why I'm going back in.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want to be
the one to tell you,

00:21:48.976 --> 00:21:50.645 position:13% line:89% align:start
but a dead body just rots.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.647 position:19% line:89% align:start
That bone I gave you...

00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:54.549 position:27% line:89% align:start
was from my mom.

00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:57.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
He took her soul as well.
She died.

00:21:58.553 --> 00:21:59.554 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:02.590 position:13% line:89% align:start
My mother gave birth to me

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:04.659 position:33% line:83% align:start
while she was
a prisoner here,

00:22:04.692 --> 00:22:07.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
and I've been hiding
in this prison ever since.

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.931 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your name... tell me.

00:22:09.964 --> 00:22:12.465 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm... Emporio.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.635 position:38% line:89% align:start
Emporio.

00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:17.071 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was able to survive
because of your mother.

00:22:17.672 --> 00:22:18.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.814 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:29.750 position:35% line:83% align:start
I have this
unexplainable confidence.

00:22:29.784 --> 00:22:33.054 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't believe my father
is actually dead.

00:22:33.087 --> 00:22:35.823 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think he'll be okay
if I can get his Stand back.

00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:37.859 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's why...

00:22:38.793 --> 00:22:39.727 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm staying!

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.595 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cocking]

00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:45.933 position:19% line:89% align:start
[ominous music playing]

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:49.737 position:35% line:89% align:start
We did it.

00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:52.240 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now we have the mighty Stand

00:22:52.273 --> 00:22:54.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the ability
to stop time.

00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:57.545 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, and we couldn't
have done it

00:22:57.578 --> 00:22:59.680 position:16% line:89% align:start
without you, Johngalli A.

00:22:59.714 --> 00:23:02.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and I make quite
a formidable duo.

00:23:02.283 --> 00:23:04.051 position:24% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Agreed.

00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:07.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, could you help me back
to the men's prison?

00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:08.789 position:19% line:89% align:start
I hadn't anticipated...

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:13.227 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's strange. Where's my gun?

00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:14.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can you see it?

00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:15.563 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's right here.

00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:28.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were the only one
that knew my true identity.

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:31.078 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it just so happens
you were the one

00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:32.479 position:16% line:89% align:start
who murdered that guard.

00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:35.883 position:21% line:83% align:start
With this, everything
will work out very nice.

00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:39.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
To be able to communicate
an idea to someone

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.888 position:19% line:89% align:start
Jotaro himself had said

00:23:40.922 --> 00:23:43.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
what a wonderful thing
it was.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
And he was right.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have the proof right here.
