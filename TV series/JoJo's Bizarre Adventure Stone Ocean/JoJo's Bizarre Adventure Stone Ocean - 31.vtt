[narrator] The following tale
begins on June 5th

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.748 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the year 1972.

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.317 position:7% line:83% align:start
It was a dark and humid night
in America's Deep South

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.654 position:19% line:83% align:start
when the first cry of
a newborn child rang

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:22.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
through the halls of
a maternity hospital.

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.325 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
before that baby had

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
the chance to see
the light of day,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
his life expired while
still curled

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.365 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the arms of his mother.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
To the young mother
who had never once

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.135 position:19% line:83% align:start
felt that she had been
living a life

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.138 position:5% line:83% align:start
that consisted of any happiness
or sense of purpose,

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.208 position:5% line:83% align:start
her newborn son was going to be
a symbol of the hope

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.845 position:21% line:83% align:start
that she would have
a better future.

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:45.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
With her first child
lost to her,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.082 position:10% line:83% align:start
that potential happiness she
longed for was lost as well,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.485 position:24% line:83% align:start
and she was unable
to accept his death.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.388 position:7% line:83% align:start
Before the doctors and nurses
could learn

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.558 position:30% line:83% align:start
of the baby's
unfortunate passing,

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.458 position:27% line:83% align:start
the young mother
slipped out of her bed

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
as if she were a phantom
in the night.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.363 position:27% line:83% align:start
She made her way
into another room

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
where she replaced
her deceased child

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.301 position:19% line:83% align:start
with one who was born
the same day

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.503 position:19% line:89% align:start
and made him her own.

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.471 position:7% line:89% align:start
This other baby which she took

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:13.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
was one of a set
of fraternal twins.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.843 position:7% line:89% align:start
To this day, the incident was

00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:17.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
never questioned
or investigated,

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
and not even a single soul
suspected a thing.

[young Father Pucchi]
Mama, whose grave is this?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.222 position:30% line:83% align:start
They were born
the same day as me.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.291 position:30% line:89% align:start
Died then too.

-[mother] Enrico.
-Huh?

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:36.731 position:38% line:83% align:start
[mother]
The truth of the matter is,

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:38.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
you had a younger brother.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.535 position:30% line:83% align:start
The two of you
were fraternal twins.

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:41.703 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.103 position:10% line:83% align:start
[mother] But he passed away
at the hospital

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
right after he was born.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:47.441 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pray for him.

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:50.612 position:33% line:89% align:start
Afterwards,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
we decided to give him
the name Domenic.

[church bell tolls]

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.723 position:19% line:83% align:start
[young Father Pucchi]
Lord, answer my plea.

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:03.791 position:13% line:83% align:start
My brother and I were born
on the same day,

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
but I lived and he died.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.195 position:10% line:77% align:start
choose to take my brother's
life and not mine?
For what reason did fate

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.330 position:10% line:83% align:start
choose to take my brother's
life and not mine?

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:15.202 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why do humans experience
happiness and misfortune?

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
What is true happiness?

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:22.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
[narrator] At this time,
Enrico was aged 15.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.945 position:19% line:83% align:start
His great-grandmother
on his father's side

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:25.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
was an Italian immigrant.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
He is descended from
a prestigious

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.984 position:19% line:83% align:start
and influential family
in Venice,

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:31.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
in which one of
his family members

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.754 position:13% line:89% align:start
became a famous clergyman

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.689 position:16% line:89% align:start
during the 18th century.

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:38.526 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, when young Enrico declared
he wanted to attend a seminary,

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
there wasn't one member
of his family who objected.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.983 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a famous biography by a
clergyman who commits adultery

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.418 position:33% line:83% align:start
and runs off
to become a painter.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
Would a believer in God

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.455 position:35% line:83% align:start
ever read
such a scandalous scripture?

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.458 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sir, just who are you?
How did you get in this place?

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.162 position:10% line:83% align:start
Except for on Sundays, this
charnel house does not allow

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.130 position:7% line:83% align:start
members of the general public
to enter.

[thumps]

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm aware of the restrictions,

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:22.603 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'm deathly allergic
to the sun.

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:26.174 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I am not mistaken,
the sun sets at 6:19 today.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until that time comes,
I cannot go home,

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.243 position:7% line:89% align:start
which is why I rested in here.

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, I see.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, in that case, is there
anything I can do to help you?

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.319 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

That's unfortunate.

I won't tell the head priest
about encountering you,

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:48.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you must be gone
when the sun sets.

to throw me out?

of its most valuable artwork,

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.214 position:19% line:89% align:start
or worse, to kill you?

Or perhaps,
you're just saying I can stay,

about a sun allergy.

I have a confession to make.

Uh, yes. Well...

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.143 position:33% line:83% align:start

I'm stricken with disease,

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.715 position:10% line:89% align:start

00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.993 position:16% line:89% align:start
My sin was to my family.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.530 position:33% line:83% align:start
16 years ago
on the night of June 5th,

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.466 position:13% line:83% align:start
after my newborn baby drew
his first and final breath,

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.669 position:13% line:83% align:start
I traded him for another.

While no one was looking,

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:47.474 position:16% line:83% align:start
I took a stranger's baby
and left mine in his place.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.211 position:19% line:89% align:start
That baby was a twin.

[young Father Pucchi gasps]

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:54.849 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm overcome with guilt!

Though she wasn't mine,

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
I raised the child
to the best of my ability.

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:04.025 position:27% line:89% align:start
I was so happy.

00:07:04.058 --> 00:07:06.327 position:7% line:83% align:start
And this little boy I watched
go through life.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
grew up to be
such a fine young man.

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:13.034 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, if I die without
ever confessing... [sobs]

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
What would happen
if I told him the truth

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.571 position:33% line:83% align:start
that he has
a brother somewhere?

00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:19.674 position:10% line:83% align:start
Though, if he finally learns
what happened,

00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:22.209 position:27% line:83% align:start
that would mean
I've lost my son before I die!

the family of the other son is?

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:32.053 position:7% line:83% align:start

in a big mansion

in the next town over.

I bet the loser comes
from a poor family.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
He probably doesn't even go
to high school.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.874 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's why he delivers juice.

Two months had passed

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.114 position:16% line:83% align:start
since the dying mother's
life-changing confession,

00:09:07.148 --> 00:09:09.717 position:35% line:83% align:start
and Enrico
was in utter mental turmoil.

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:12.720 position:13% line:83% align:start
Although he had not become
a priest yet,

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:15.389 position:19% line:83% align:start
Enrico was still bound
by the seal of confession

00:09:15.423 --> 00:09:18.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
and could not disclose anything
to anyone.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.595 position:24% line:83% align:start
He had to keep it
a secret at all costs.

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:23.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, in the eyes
of the church,

00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:25.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
he would be a failure
as a man of God.

[young Father Pucchi]
That mother will die soon,

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:31.338 position:10% line:83% align:start
and she's going to take her
secret with her to the grave.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.142 position:13% line:83% align:start
Even if I can convince her
to confess to everyone,

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:39.980 position:5% line:83% align:start
would we, or at the very least,
would my brother

[narrator] Let's start
with the conclusion.

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.866 position:10% line:89% align:start
The soon-to-be-priest Enrico

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:34.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
never once uttered
a word to his sister

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
about her new boyfriend,
Weather,

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.138 position:5% line:89% align:start
being his younger twin brother.

00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:41.242 position:5% line:89% align:start
From here on out in this story,

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:44.645 position:7% line:83% align:start
I would like you, the viewer,
to be the judge in deciding

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:47.748 position:30% line:83% align:start
who is the one
who has committed a sin.

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
Was it the mother
who had sinned

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:50.985 position:7% line:89% align:start
or having switched the babies?

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:51.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
The parents?

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.155 position:38% line:89% align:start
Enrico?

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:56.757 position:24% line:83% align:start
Or was it Weather,
who didn't know a thing?

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.326 position:7% line:89% align:start
He looked into who Weather was

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.663 position:10% line:83% align:start
to learn who it is that his
sister had fallen in love with.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.698 position:24% line:83% align:start
After discovering
the shocking truth,

00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:07.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
in Enrico's mind,
there is only one solution.

he was mad at the world

00:17:57.712 --> 00:18:00.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
for having to deal with
everything around him.

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:03.250 position:7% line:89% align:start
Angry that he was still alive,

but a sudden gust of wind
blew him back up.

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:21.502 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then, he tried to drown himself

his rage became
a devastating fury.

00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:43.091 position:10% line:83% align:start
His hatred started to extend
not only to the townspeople,

On the fourth night,

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:52.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
a major snail infestation
had invaded the town.

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:54.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
But why was it snails?

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:57.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
And where exactly
did they come from?

00:19:03.011 --> 00:19:07.180 position:7% line:83% align:start
what was going on was Enrico,
who woke up in a hospital.

00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:10.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's Wes... No, it's Weather.

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:12.285 position:19% line:89% align:start
My brother isn't dead.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since he and I share
the same blood,

00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:18.258 position:13% line:83% align:start
the awakening of my powers
must have awakened his own.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.862 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just like how I wished for
the preservation of memories,

00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:23.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
this must be what Weather
desired unconsciously.

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:26.333 position:7% line:83% align:start
If these snails were to start
crawling up my arm

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:27.702 position:10% line:89% align:start
in order to do away with me,

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:29.904 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would have to finish off
my brother.

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.008 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm willing to do anything
from now on,

00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:37.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
even if that means
I have to kill.

I shall go see that man.

The one who is named Dio.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:47.220 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why does fate
bring two people together?

00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:49.691 position:30% line:83% align:start

that he knows the answer.
