1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,458
I've been flying for two weeks.

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,458
And I still haven't
seen... land.

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,291
A tornado! Crap!

4
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,708
Cruise equals happiness!

5
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,833
You know what Eri...?

6
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,916
I can't believe you invited the
whole class to go on a cruise...

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,750
That's amazingly cool.

8
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,916
Well, I thought it
would be more fun

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,083
if a lot of people came with us.

10
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,000
There's more than
enough room on the ship.

11
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,500
Plus, I really like the idea
of being able to hang out

12
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,083
with everyone before
winter break is over.

13
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,208
And what's better than relaxing
on a cruise? Am I right?

14
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,125
Oh yeah.

15
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,416
Being on vacation

16
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,625
is no excuse to stop
training, right Ichijou?!

17
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,083
Yeah, that's right!

18
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,166
Hey, Tenma.

19
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,708
Why isn't Karasuma here?

20
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,291
Yeah Tenma, how come you
didn't make him come with you?

21
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,791
Well, see...

22
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,500
He said he had to go
visit some of his relatives.

23
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,541
Oh, by the way,
where is Harima...?

24
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,666
Hey, Eri! Have you seen Harima?

25
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,208
He got on the ship
with the rest of us.

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,666
Did you hide Harima
away somewhere, Eri?

27
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,833
Why are you asking me that?

28
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,416
How am I supposed
to know where he is?

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,125
For all I know about him,

30
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,500
He's probably sulking in
some dark corner somewhere.

31
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,041
I finally get this
rare opportunity to go

32
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,250
on a dream cruise with Tenma...

33
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,875
But, I have to do the
30 page supplement

34
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,500
for the spring special...

35
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,500
and it's frickin' due
the day after tomorrow!

36
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,041
♪ Oh, say can you see? ♪

37
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,416
♪ By the dawn's
early light... ♪

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,625
One - Two! One - Two!
One - Two! One - Two!

39
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,166
Look at this sky.

40
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,750
Reminds me of
my days in California!

41
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,375
Hey. Are you sure we're
going in the right direction?

42
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,583
Hold on. Let me take a look.

43
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,416
Just as I thought.
Right on target!

44
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,916
All right.

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,291
Full speed ahead!!

46
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,791
Huh? Aw, crap!!

47
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,875
Let's see. Awesome!

48
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,958
It looks like it's
thawing out just perfectly!

49
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,541
This is too heavy.

50
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,208
Is anybody out there?

51
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,583
I could really use
a hand in here!

52
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,291
Whiskers?

53
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
Leave it to me. I can
handle this big tuna.

54
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,583
Damn it!

55
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,916
I spent so much time on
that huge fishing boat,

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,375
and all I did was draw comics!

57
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,833
I give up! I give up!

58
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,125
You are such an idiot...!

59
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,625
Masaru? Take care of it, please.

60
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,666
I see.

61
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,083
So, you handled the
challenge well, didn't you?

62
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,791
Good job, Masaru.

63
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,833
Oh, wow! It's a Sashimi platter!

64
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,250
Yayyyy!

65
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,791
I'm going to see how the
children are doing down there.

66
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,750
I need you to take over for me.

67
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,541
All you have to do is
steer straight ahead.

68
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,333
I trust you won't
make a mistake.

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,375
I'm just a thug.
I'm no good to anybody.

70
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,375
Hey! Look over there!

71
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,583
That's Tougou and Harry!
What're they doing?

72
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,666
They really did it.

73
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,833
Huh? You mean,
you knew about this?

74
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,333
From what
I understand they wanted

75
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,333
to travel by kayak and
then try to catch up

76
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,583
with us somewhere
in the South Seas.

77
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,208
They were kayaking in
the middle of the ocean...?

78
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,916
Haven't they ever
heard of a typhoon?

79
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,250
Incredible!

80
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,333
They Kayaked all this way?

81
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:57,750
I can't believe this!

82
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,583
Wow.

83
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,875
That's freakin' amazing.

84
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
Huh?

85
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,500
Everybody!
Look over there! It's a reef!

86
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,666
We're gonna hit it!

87
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,166
Huh?

88
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,375
Ahh! We're gonna die!!

89
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,250
I fear no reef!

90
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,416
Indeed, the reef has destroyed
the vessels of many sailors

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,166
since the time of yore, and also
dashed their hopes and dreams.

92
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,166
Any ordinary sailor would
give up and try to turn around!

93
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,500
Not I. Please do not
lose heart, my friends.

94
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,916
Would you like to
try a tuna eyeball?

95
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,208
You kidding?
It's one of my favorites.

96
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,916
Masaru! What the
hell are you doing!

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,333
What's wrong with you!

98
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,583
We're about to crash into
a bunch of rocks! Turn it!

99
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,541
So, come on!

100
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,208
All you gods of the sea,
give me your worst

101
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,000
and I will overcome it all!

102
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,041
No challenge is too great
for me, for I am Tougou!

103
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,416
Full Speed Ahead!!

104
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,083
It's no use. The engine
is destroyed beyond repair.

105
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,125
This radio is out too.
There's no response.

106
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,666
Isn't there anything we can do?

107
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,750
I can't get a signal
on the cell phone.

108
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,291
Why aren't they working?

109
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,416
We're in an unusual area.

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,875
Special waves
interfere with electronics.

111
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,583
Similar to the ones
in the Bermuda Triangle.

112
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,208
Bermuda?

113
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,541
The only option we have
left is to go find another ship

114
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,083
and send it back to rescue you.

115
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,875
Please hurry. and good luck.

116
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,125
We'll be here waiting.

117
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,125
There was so much that
I wanted to say to you.

118
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm alive.

119
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,666
You're here!

120
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,375
Yakumo! What is this place?

121
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,416
Wait... You're not Yakumo.

122
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,416
Who are you?

123
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,833
What am I doing here?

124
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,125
Ya'akamo!

125
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,500
Hold on!

126
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,750
Where am I? I've never
seen this place before.

127
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:01,541
But somehow...
it's very familiar.

128
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,583
Don't look at them!

129
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,208
They aren't who
you think they are!

130
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,583
Hey, you! Just what do
you think you're doing here?!

131
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,208
Sorry...! Uh... We've met?

132
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,458
Have we not?

133
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,916
What...?
But that's impossible...

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,083
I guess you're right.

135
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,166
My name is La'ara.
Nice to meet you.

136
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,375
Sorry... You look very
much like someone I knew

137
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,750
a long time ago,
from my travels abroad.

138
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,083
You must want to get back home
so you can see your friends.

139
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,500
You should talk to the queen.

140
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,833
Maybe she can help.

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,458
Oh! Da eri da! Hide fus e!

142
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:50,041
Takabisha! Takabisha!
Takabisha! Takabisha!

143
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,708
That is our queen, E'eri.

144
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,083
I should've known.

145
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,833
Ya'akamo! Ja masuruna!
Shu'uga hitta Teyo!

146
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,000
There's a strange
feeling in the atmosphere.

147
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,666
I know. It's because
they are preparing

148
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,291
for this year's sacrifice.

149
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,375
Saso! Tuua Ruki!

150
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,791
She's the one they've chosen.

151
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,000
What?!!!!

152
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,250
Hanai to the rescue!

153
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,666
I don't know
what's going on here.

154
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,083
But I won't stand back and watch
you sacrifice an innocent girl!

155
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,750
Hey! What are you doing?!

156
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,333
It's the modern age
and you're stupid enough

157
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,250
to believe in this
prehistoric ritual?!

158
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,291
Meow.

159
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,333
You have just caused
us great catastrophe!

160
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,458
Because of you our
village will be destroyed

161
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,541
by the evil beast, Deviltusk!

162
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,791
Fine then!

163
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,541
I, Haruki Hanai, swear on
my life that I will defeat

164
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,125
your bloodthirsty,
demon god Deviltusk!

165
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,958
Well, if you want
to save Ya'akamo,

166
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,125
then you must do
exactly as I say.

167
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,625
On the night of the full moon,

168
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,250
go to the forest of Kutapanda
and kill Deviltusk for us.

169
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,458
This is Kutapanda's forest.

170
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,291
He sleeps inside that statue.

171
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,416
He is our village's
guardian deity.

172
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,541
It is said that if our
village is ever threatened,

173
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,583
he will once again
awaken and defend us.

174
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,958
Is that true?

175
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,416
It's not been tested.

176
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,416
And this forest is now
the lair of deviltusk.

177
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
I see.

178
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,791
This is bad!

179
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,375
Deviltusk is headed this way!

180
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,916
It's about time!

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,208
What exactly is
this monster anyway?

182
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,750
You don't have to do this.

183
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,500
D-D-D-D-Don't worry!

184
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,083
I p-p-p-promise
I'll take care of you!

185
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,916
Damn!!

186
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,416
I will not let you touch
her, you foul beast!

187
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,916
Look Hanai!
Kuta panda! Kuta panda!

188
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,208
Hold on!
Don't believe in fake gods!

189
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,750
Trust me instead!

190
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,083
Those eyes.
They're telling me something...

191
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,750
Could it be?

192
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,583
That this is the key
to awakening their god?

193
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,958
Kuta panda has awakened!

194
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,708
Hanai has given our
village hope for the future.

195
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,750
We thank you.

196
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,625
Don't mention it.

197
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,791
Um...

198
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,458
Hanai, father said
I'm to marry you. So...

199
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,500
What?!

200
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,958
So that, we'll
be together forever.

201
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,833
But Yakumo! It's so sudden!

202
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,791
What are you doing?

203
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,375
You're amazing, Ya'akumo.

204
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,458
Farewell!! Everyone!

205
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,791
Takabisha!

206
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,875
I will miss you... Hanai.

207
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,791
I just had a really weird dream
where Yakumo was Ya'akamo.

208
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,041
Huh?! That's insane!!

209
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
I dreamed the exact
same thing just now!

210
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,375
Wait! And I was
the queen, wasn't I?!

211
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,833
Yeah! You were!

212
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,916
Tell me why the hell both of
us had a dream about Hanai?

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Yeah, seriously.

214
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,208
Ahoy!!!

215
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,208
What?! Is... i-is that Hanai?!

216
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,625
Hey!! Hey!!

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,958
You're right! It is him!

218
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,916
What is it? Whoa!!! It's Hanai!!

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,916
He's been flying ever
since the episode before last.

220
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,291
I wonder if he's
here to save us.

221
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,583
Of course! He brought
Kuta panda back to life.

222
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,208
Hey!!! Hanai!!!

223
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,208
This is weird!

224
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,458
What are all of you
guys doing out here?

225
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,750
You're the one who just
flew here on a kite, remember?

226
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,041
Good point...

227
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,916
I was just trying
to get back home...

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,916
But, I ran into some trouble
with the kite along the way.

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,250
So in other words, you're
stranded too, aren't you?

230
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,875
That is correct!

231
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,791
On my journey, I found
this strange little village...

232
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,583
awakened a sleeping deity,

233
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,541
and defeated the
demon Deviltusk.

234
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,833
But, I'm sure you don't
wanna hear about that anyway.

235
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,500
So, what the heck
are you doing out here

236
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,791
in the middle of the ocean?

237
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,541
It doesn't seem like this
ship has moved much

238
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,125
since I landed on it.

239
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,625
Oh, I see! You must be stranded!

240
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,958
I'm just kidding!

241
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,625
Oh, sh--!

242
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,208
I can't believe all the
food got tossed overboard.

243
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,583
I'm so hungry.

244
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,000
We're all gonna starve
to death, aren't we?

245
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,250
Don't do this, Imadori.
Come on, don't give up.

246
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,125
Hey, why don't we make up
a fun song or something?

247
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,541
A fun song or something?

248
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,166
♪ A-one, and-a-two, and-a! ♪

249
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,083
♪ Once upon a time there
was a number called three. ♪

250
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,333
♪ It fell over on its side,
and then it said to me: ♪

251
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,125
♪ "Whoopee! Look at me! ♪

252
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,500
♪ Now I look like
a couple of D's!" ♪

253
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,208
D-cups, that is...

254
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,583
Huh?! Oh crap!

255
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,166
Go to hell!
You stinkin' pervert!

256
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,291
What's wrong with you guys?!

257
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,208
What are you all
so depressed for?

258
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,291
Don't worry! Be happy!!

259
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,041
Shut up you idiot.

260
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,833
I can't even think.

261
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,291
I haven't had anything
to eat for an entire day.

262
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,416
I wish there was something
I could do to help Tenma.

263
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Hey. Doesn't it seem like it's
gotten a bit chillier lately?

264
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah. It really does.

265
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,041
Don't worry about
a thing, Yakumo.

266
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,208
I'll try to keep you
as warm as I can.

267
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,041
Even if we don't survive this.

268
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,041
I'm glad I'm here
with my sister.

269
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,250
I'm trying to be strong.

270
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,250
But all I can
think about is food.

271
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,083
Oh, look!

272
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,666
No way! Karasuma?!

273
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,125
Naw, can't be!

274
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,291
But still, even if it is an
illusion, I'm happy to see him!

275
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,875
What? Are you trying
to tell me something?

276
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,916
Oh, I... I get it.

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,625
You're trying to tell
me not to give up, huh?

278
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,791
I think I understand.
I won't lose heart!

279
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,833
What's going on?

280
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,583
That's right. None of
us should lose heart!

281
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,958
'Cause we are the
world... and so on.

282
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,583
You guys!

283
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,583
Karasuma! Thank you so much!

284
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,166
All right!!

285
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm gonna go take
a look at the engine.

286
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,375
I'll come too!

287
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,666
You wanna go catch some fish?

288
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,125
Abso-freakin-lutely!

289
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,041
Ichijou, we must find some
oars and paddle to freedom!

290
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,083
Huh?!

291
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,583
What was that?!

292
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,666
What the hell?!

293
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,000
It's a whale!!

294
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,000
Ahh...! It's a whale!

295
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,333
It's coming!

296
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,291
It'll kill us!!

297
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,500
Everybody duck!

298
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,750
What are you doing?! Get down!

299
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,833
We're dead!

300
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,083
Huh? What's happening?

301
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,458
Who'da thought a
whale would fall in love

302
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,750
with Tenma's sister
at first sight like that?

303
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,541
Well, I guess
it worked out for the best,

304
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,083
seeing as how
we're getting rescued...

305
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,041
Whale power!

306
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,291
It's the wave of the future.

307
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,916
Get it? "Wave"?
'Cause he's like, you know...

308
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,458
You're awesome,
Mr. Whale...! Thank you!

309
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,916
Not really that funny.

310
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,916
All right! Homeward
bound! Let's go!!

311
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,291
Yeah!!! All right!

312
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,333
Who's up for shuffleboard?

313
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:16,750
♪ ending song ♪

314
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,500
Miss Eri?

00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,208
Da reeda ome'e?

316
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,791
All alone... with an old book...

and a sister
who's never changed.

Is this really what you want?

319
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,583
All alone? All alone.
