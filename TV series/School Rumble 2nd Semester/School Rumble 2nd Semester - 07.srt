1
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,250
♪ Autumn leaves,
near the dam... ♪

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,708
It's been a long time since
we all went out together.

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,500
Yeah, I mean, we've been so
busy with the culture festival.

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,916
The leaves are
so pretty right now.

5
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
Hey, hey, is anyone else hungry?

6
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,625
Yeah, sure... let's open
up those box lunches.

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,708
What's keeping the boys?

8
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,208
Why'd you invite them anyway?

9
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,875
They have their uses.

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,083
Why do you suppose they brought

11
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,125
all that extra stuff
along just for a picnic?

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,875
Even while picnicking
one must always be on guard

13
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,083
Mountain weather can
change at any given moment...

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,833
You have to be prepared for
anything... and everything.

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,666
Oh, Harima, I'm so glad we had
a chance to be alone like this.

16
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,708
Don't you worry
about a thing, baby...!

17
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,375
I'm gonna keep
you safe and sound.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,416
This is heavy...! Too heavy...!

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,083
My precious back muscles
are being compromised.

20
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,666
Ahh! Now this is
what I call living!

21
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,083
You jackass!
What are you doing?!

22
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,041
You didn't expect me to walk
all the way up here, did you?

23
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,875
Out of the bag, freeloader!

24
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,166
Lunch... lunch...
I love lunch...

25
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:31,166
Ho, ho, ho... behold Yakumo's
extra special picnic lunch!

26
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,375
What the?

27
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,750
Sis... you left the
other dishes at home!

28
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,958
I'm sorry...! I guess
I forgot to pack them...!

29
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,083
I'll make up for it by making
some of my famous rice balls!

30
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,708
I guess we have no choice,
so I'll give you a hand, okay?

31
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,458
No! Just a minute!!

32
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,125
Why not let me cook something?!

33
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,833
Being the amazing
person that I am,

34
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,541
I brought along
some cooking gear.

35
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,250
Ho ho! Good thinking, Harima!

36
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,333
He certainly perked
up in a hurry.

37
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,875
Good! The last thing
I wanted to do was manual labor

38
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,666
I don't know if
there's anything cooler

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,625
than a man who
knows how to cook!

40
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,875
You stay out of this,
Four-eyes...!

41
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,333
I'll handle the cooking!

42
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,041
Like hell you will...!

43
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,333
Besides, what does
a delinquent like you

44
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,791
know how to cook anyway?!

45
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,708
I'll show you--! I make
a mean soufflé of pain!

46
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,083
Gentlemen... why
don't you both cook?

47
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,333
We'll have a
men's outdoor cook-off!

48
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,416
That sounds awesome!

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,708
Yeah, let's do it!

50
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,541
This is gonna be fun!

51
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,791
I'm in!

52
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,791
Yeah, we'll settle this
thing once and for all!

53
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,375
Oo, oo!

54
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,291
I wanna play too!

55
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,083
What...? The only thing you
ever play with is yourself.

56
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,125
What's the catch?

57
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,916
If I win, Miko has to kiss me!

58
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,833
These are the rules, men.

59
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,958
You are allowed to
cook anything you want,

60
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,208
but you have to supply
your own ingredients.

61
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,416
Okay!

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,416
All right, begin!

63
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,041
Tenma, soon you'll know
what my love tastes like!

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,166
I am not gonna
lose to that punk!

65
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,875
Miko, don't forget my kiss!

66
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,541
If your lips come near me,
I'm ripping ' em off!

67
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,916
I can show off the skills
I learned at sea as a fisherman!

68
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,125
But ordinary food isn't
gonna be good enough!

69
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,958
It's gotta be something with
more, I don't know, impact!

70
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,416
You... you're huge...! You must
be the king of this river!

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,583
All right...!
If I can bag this guy,

72
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,583
I'll have the
ultimate ingredient!

73
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,416
Huh...

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,583
I've got the mushrooms
and other wild herbs,

75
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,916
but I still haven't
acquired the meat.

76
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,458
Meat! I hear your primal call.

77
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,791
What a beast...!
He's so beautiful...!

78
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,333
I will rise to the occasion
and put my skills to the test!

79
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,125
Mission one has
been accomplished...

80
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,541
Holy crap! They look like hell.

81
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,916
Right...! Start cooking!

82
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,125
This is starting
to get exciting, huh?

83
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,833
Wait a second...
where's Imadori?

84
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,708
D-cup-a-licious...

85
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,458
Captain Pervo's outta the race.

86
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,416
What a surprise.

87
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,875
All I have to do...

88
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,708
is add my secret
ingredient and it's done!

89
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,416
That's nice...
but guess what...?

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,041
It doesn't matter
what you've got...

91
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,208
it's no match for
my secret ingredient... ha!

92
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,833
Finished!

93
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,375
I'm done!

94
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,083
And now it's
time for the tasting.

95
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,166
We'll start with Imadori's dish.

96
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,583
Imadori...?
I thought he was out...?

97
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,416
Having studied
with the great chefs of the

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,541
European cruise ships, sampling
spices at port after port,

99
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,916
I finally perfected
this jewel of a curry.

100
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,750
It's... it's... perfect!

101
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,833
The sauce is the best
thing I've ever tasted!

102
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,625
Naturally...! See... I used
the finest flour and beef tallow

103
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,000
and let the roux
simmer for days,

104
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,541
roasting it slowly
for maximum taste.

105
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,291
So you weren't just lying
around doing nothing?

106
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,375
Of course not!

107
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,541
Time is the best
seasoning there is!

108
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,875
This tender, thinly
sliced beef, mingled

109
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333
with the perfectly steamed rice,

110
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,875
gives it a genuine
western flavor!

111
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,083
I feel like I've
tasted this dish before.

112
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,083
That's because you have!

113
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,000
It's Guruguru Curry...
Primo blend!

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,291
No packaged ingredients!

115
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,416
I thought it just
had to taste good!

116
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,250
Loser.

117
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,875
Taking shortcuts... huh?

118
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,333
Too bad... looks like Imadori
fails to collect his kiss.

119
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,875
What? I never offered!

120
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,250
Please, give me
another chance...

121
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,583
Here's a dish
that comes straight

122
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,666
from the depths of my heart!

123
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,250
Miko D-cup curry!

124
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,041
Out of bounds.
Imadori is disqualified.

125
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,000
Next up is Harima's dish.

126
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,458
I'm a man of few words...
My food speaks for itself.

127
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,500
What is this?

128
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
What a hearty miso flavor!

129
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,958
Oh, my mouth is like totally
blissing out on this stuff!

130
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,291
That's right! I am a genius!

131
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,583
Eat it...! Gorge yourself on
the delicacy of delicacies,

132
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,541
the Japanese mitten crab!

133
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,333
Yummy... Yummy... Yummy...

134
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,083
My tummy!

135
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,125
It's absolutely delicious...

136
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,375
Tenma!

137
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,208
It's so nice to have a
boyfriend who can cook!

138
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,583
But isn't the
flavor a little sharp?

139
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,833
Say what?!

140
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,625
Now that you mention it,
it is a little salty.

141
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,083
It can't be!

142
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,125
You forgot about the order...
for the seasoning.

143
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,625
Huh?

144
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,750
That's right... You put the
salt in first, didn't you?

145
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,791
Uh... yeah.
What's wrong with that?

146
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,208
Don't you know it's critical
to add seasonings in order,

147
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,833
according to
molecular weight...?

148
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,500
Otherwise you completely throw
off the balance of the flavor.

149
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,666
I didn't know!!

150
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,458
That's a physics
teacher for you!

151
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,000
What a great observation.

152
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,958
Thanks, and it's
actually chemistry.

153
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,375
Well, we're off...
let's go, Youko.

154
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,166
We'll see you!

155
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,291
Dropping by in the middle
of their weekend drive...

156
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:01,333
those were our guest tasters
Ms. Osakabe and Ms. Sasakura.

157
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,166
And now, Hanai's dish.

158
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,416
My dish is a hot stew pot.

159
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,166
Wow... it looks amazing.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,291
Wild plant stew, right?

161
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,708
Hm...! Not quite,
Miss Tsukamoto!

162
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,125
Behold if you dare, and feast
upon the magic that is my stew!

163
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,458
Incredible...
I can't stop tearing up...

164
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,541
Yakumo... How is it?

165
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,833
It's absolutely delicious.

166
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,416
Ah...! Say it slow!!

167
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,458
It's so nice to have
a husband who can cook!

168
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,500
Yeah but, doesn't it
taste kind of murky?

169
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
No! That's impossible!

170
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,666
You forgot to rinse
the mushrooms didn't you?

171
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,291
No, how could I?!!

172
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,750
Your finish was weak.

173
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,875
Huh?

174
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,625
Your mind was filled
with apprehension

175
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,875
and that caused you
to lose your focus.

176
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,000
If you could make your
heart as clear as glass

177
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,875
you would not fall back
into such a deluded state.

178
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,791
I... I'm so sorry!

179
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,500
He's off his guard...

180
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,916
if you want to score with him,

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,541
now's your chance,
you sexy little squirrel!

182
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,958
Say what?!!

183
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,458
Grandpa, what are you
doing roaming around outside?

184
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,125
I'm sorry, do I know you?

185
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,333
Oh...! You keep
getting more senile!

186
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,333
Don't get sassy
with me, young lady!

187
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,541
That was our
guest Matakichi Ito.

188
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
Now it's time for the results...

189
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,000
who will the goddess
of victory smile upon?

190
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:07,625
On me!!

191
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,833
No, me!

192
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,958
Here's the chairman
of the tasting panel.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,083
Masaru Suzuki.

194
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,875
Huh?

195
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,500
And now for his special dish,
roast duck with foie grae.

196
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh, wow!

197
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,750
Masaru is a
much better cook

198
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,708
than you'd guess
by looking at him.

199
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,916
They ordered these ingredients
all the way from France!

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,291
It's absolutely delicious!

201
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,541
I know, you can't get
much more perfect than this.

202
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,375
I guess there's only
so much you can do

203
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,541
with local
ingredients, huh...?

204
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,208
Hmmmm... Well... Hey!

205
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,125
Production assistant, huh?

206
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,500
Anime is based on
comics after all...

207
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
could be a good experience.

208
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,041
You probably didn't
know that a lot of

209
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,625
the School Rumble characters
have part-time jobs...

210
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,208
Today, for a change of pace,

211
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,333
we'll take a look
at them at work.

212
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,291
Wow... so that fortress
is Studio Homet?

213
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,791
Well... here goes nothing.

214
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,125
Harima, for instance,

215
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,041
has gone to work as an
animation production assistant.

216
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,125
Sara and Asou work at
a Chinese restaurant run

217
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
by Mr. Chen from New Jersey.

218
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,083
Good morning, everybody...! Huh?

219
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,791
Is something wrong, Mister Chen?

220
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,666
Oh, Sara...!
I'm really in a pickle!

221
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,416
The hospital called and
my wife is in labor...!

222
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
They said our baby's gonna
be born a whole week early!

223
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,875
Why don't you just go ahead
and close the restaurant.

224
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,833
I can't... I've got
a reservation today!

225
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,916
That's okay!

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,833
Asou and I can
handle things here...!

227
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,958
Don't worry about a thing!

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,416
Thanks a lot, kids,
I'll see you later, good luck!

229
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,583
This won't work... Let's close.

230
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,250
We should at least take
care of the reservation.

231
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,666
It's more than the
two of us can handle...

232
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,958
I'll just explain
and send them away.

233
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,750
Nihao!

234
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,791
Hey there, Chen looking
good, my friend!

235
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,625
We'll need a table
for eight please!

236
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,916
Uh, I'm sorry, but the
restaurant is closed today...

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,291
Cheers!

238
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,708
They're not even listening.

239
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, we can't
throw them out, right?

240
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,333
Let's give it a shot!

241
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,333
And so... their battle began...

242
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,125
I've just finished
this new costume.

243
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,750
I'd like you to wear it.

244
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,125
Uh... what is that, exactly?

245
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,208
Yakumo's boss was a cosplay fan.

246
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,625
Tea with Yakumo...!
Puts a song in my heart!

247
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,041
Huh?!

248
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,333
Yeahhhhh...

249
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,125
Holy crap!...!
They're making Yakumo dress up

250
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,750
in one of those
bunny girl costumes?!

251
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,583
Yahoo!

252
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,375
Man... I gotta see that!

253
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,708
No, it's wrong...

254
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,000
Which means that...
I must save her... and be...

255
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,083
A hero!

256
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,541
C... Come on in.

257
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,333
Oh... Hello.

258
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,583
I'll... have an espresso, please

259
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,333
Yes sir, I'll have that
for you in just a moment.

260
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,666
Thank you for waiting.

261
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,458
Here's the espresso you ordered.

262
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,833
The customers all stayed
in the shop 'til closing time...

263
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,333
Their constant staring
wore Yakumo out.

264
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,458
The Nishimoto family
business was a video shop...

265
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,375
several boys from
class had come to help

266
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,125
the popular Nishimoto
with the... remodeling.

267
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,875
There's nothing on the
shelves but the regular stuff.

268
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,791
Where are all the
"naughty" videos?

269
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,500
Yeah, I mean, that's the
whole reason we came here!

270
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,458
Huh?

271
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,416
What have we got here?

272
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,166
What is it?

273
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,208
We should investigate.

274
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,833
Aaand... pull!!

275
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,333
Why would there be a door there?

276
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,208
I see you've found it.

277
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,375
That is the forbidden room.

278
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,541
You mean, that's where
the "naughty" videos are?

279
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,208
Please, chief, you gotta
let us in that room!

280
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
We're begging you!

281
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,583
Very well, but know this,
no one who enters

282
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,000
that room comes out
the same man as before.

283
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,291
Now that you've been warned,

284
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,625
do you still have the
courage to proceed?

285
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,083
Though it cost us our lives,

286
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,500
we will dare to enter
the forbidden room!

287
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,666
As you wish.

288
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,083
And so... their
eyes were scorched...

289
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,791
and their souls plucked out.

290
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,833
Welcome to WasBurger!

291
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,375
Karen and Lara
work at WasBurger.

292
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,916
Yo...! Ichijou!

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,708
Yes?

294
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,125
Imadori!

295
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,625
What do you want?

296
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,041
I had to stop by.

297
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,958
You see... I couldn't go
anywhere but this restaurant.

298
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,958
Are you saying you...?

299
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:39,875
Gimme.

300
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,750
Huh...? But that's...

301
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,666
that's the children's super
duper Dozibiron fun meal.

302
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,791
I know... but jeez, give
a classmate a break!

303
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm sorry...

304
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,333
Do it!

305
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,375
Come on, Itchy,
what goin' on...?

306
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought you and
me were buddies!

307
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,166
The Itchy I know
would hook a guy up...

308
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,500
Dejale stupido!

309
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,250
Ichijou...! Help me...!

310
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,458
Please! Stop! Please!

311
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,791
So the battle between
Imadori and Lara raged on.

312
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,750
Tenma worked part
time at a bakery.

313
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:19,541
Here we go putting buns in bags,
buns in bags, buns in bags...

314
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:23,250
Whew, that's that...! Now
I can finally take a breather!

315
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,375
Hey, newbie, we got a
fresh batch of bread here,

316
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,000
so get your buns in
gear and get going!

317
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,208
Oh...! Right!

318
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
Finished!

319
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,625
Here's the next batch!

320
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,750
Next batch!

321
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,416
All done!

322
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,750
Not yet!

323
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,875
Here's some more!

324
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,291
And some more!

325
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,791
Man, I'm starting to get loopy!

326
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,958
Hey, I know!

327
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,083
I'll just pretend
these buns are Karasuma!

328
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,875
Ms. Tsukamoto...
put me inside you.

329
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,333
Ah!

330
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,791
Oookay. Moving on, then...

331
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,333
Akira works in a used bookstore.

332
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,250
Why a used bookstore?

333
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,541
Well, not that
many people come in...

334
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,541
and they let me read as much
as I like in my spare time.

335
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,750
Books, huh...?

336
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,791
I gotta admit, they're
not really my thing.

337
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,375
You would get a job that's
all about mental activity.

338
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,708
I have another job
that's more physical.

339
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,291
Since when?

340
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,250
Je comprend.

341
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,500
Je comprend?

342
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,250
If she told you about it,
she'd have to kill you.

343
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,291
Ahh... I'm exhausted.

344
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,416
Thanks for everything
you did today...

345
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,583
It was actually
kinda fun wasn't it?

346
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,750
Fun, huh...?
You are something else.

347
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,291
Well, I'm back.

348
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,916
Oh, my, how'd it go?
How's the baby?

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,125
No kid yet.

350
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,583
False alarm.

351
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,125
Huh?

352
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,000
They're gonna kill me!

353
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,416
Animation's no kinda
job for a human being...!

354
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,333
I'll stick to comics you
anime people are freaks!

355
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,208
Mister Nijo, I'd like to
welcome you to Studio Homet!

356
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,583
We think Genroku Defense Force
will be our best anime yet!

357
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,541
That was absolutely
unbefreakinglievable.

358
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,583
To think things
like that exist...

359
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,833
The Swimsuit Sumo series
is the greatest thing

360
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,166
I've ever seen in my life.

361
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,750
Yakumo...

362
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,500
Huh...? Sis!

363
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,916
Are you okay?

364
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,750
No, I don't really think
I'm cut out for manual labor...

365
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,166
I need to get a more creative
job... like saving the whales.

366
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,125
Invincible Robot Dozibiron...

367
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,333
I love you...

368
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,125
Let me fly away with you
and forget all the pain...

369
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,708
Dammit...

370
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,041
Someday I'll be an
original comic book artist,

371
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,458
make it into anime,

372
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,625
and settle down and raise
a happy family with Tenma!

373
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,458
Hm...? Man...

374
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,291
What the hell's
happennin' to this country?

375
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,291
Just hang on, Tenma.

376
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
Wait, was that...?

377
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,458
There's no way.

378
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,541
You formed a girls'
basketball team?

379
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,041
Hey, I didn't form it!

380
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,958
There're some cute girls on
that team, aren't there...!

381
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,750
Can I join?

382
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
You're not a girl, idiot!

383
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:05,458
Next time on School Rumble!
Well, the subtitle says it all.

384
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,750
Do it right, will ya?
