1
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,958
Two hundred years ago...

2
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,083
at a certain tea house
along a country highway...

3
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,125
Here's your food...

4
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,333
Thank you.

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,791
Tasty!

6
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,291
Lord Samurai...
you are truly fortunate.

7
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,208
Our dumplings are known as
the best-tasting on the highway.

8
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,500
So I see.

9
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,500
No wonder you're doing so well.

10
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,375
Is something wrong?

11
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,333
The truth is, our sick father
requires expensive medicine,

12
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:21,541
and we're deeply in debt to the
ruthless Tennoji moneylenders.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,041
If we can't pay back what
we owe them by the deadline,

14
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,333
they're going to take the
teahouse away from us!

15
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,625
Unacceptable!

16
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:30,958
They've bribed the
local officials to let them

17
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,125
charge outrageous
levels of interest!

18
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,875
That's completely disgraceful!

19
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,291
But have no fear, madam...

20
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,541
I'm not the world's
greatest samurai...

21
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,083
but I swear to stand by
you in your hour of need!

22
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,333
Do you really mean it?

23
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,333
Thank you, noble
warrior, thank you!

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,541
I knew we could count
on you, Lord Samurai!

25
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,708
No gratitude need be voiced!

26
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,333
And so, on the day
of the deadline...

27
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,083
It's... awful...!

28
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,125
Looks like this is
the end of the teahouse!

29
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,541
Well... ready to pay us
the money you owe us,

30
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,083
or do we have to get tough?

31
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,583
Oh, please, sir... is there
nothing else we can give you?

32
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,375
Sure, I'll take you as payment.

33
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,708
Uh... but I...

34
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,750
No, wait...! If you
must take someone, take me!

35
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,041
No way... we only
take the pretty ones.

36
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,125
Okay, men... let's move out!

37
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,583
Not so fast!

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,250
I am Haruki Yasuboro Hanai,
leader of the Hanai clan...

39
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,375
and I have come to put an end to
this disgraceful injustice...!

40
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,750
Now, release this girl or--

41
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,000
Huh?!

42
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,500
Who are you?!

43
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,416
I can see that
you're no amateur.

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,666
You asked for it!

45
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,416
Hey, boss...!
Boss Tennoji we need you!

46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,208
We're screwed!

47
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,333
Oooh yeah... now would be
a good time for you to leave.

48
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,541
Uhh... maybe I spoke too soon!

49
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,291
Oh, wow...

50
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,041
Could it be, the
samurai of legend...?

51
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,625
It is I.

52
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,708
Hold on!

53
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,083
Harima, why are
you playing Mangoku?!

54
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,500
Miss Tsukamoto...

55
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,375
It's because this
is School Rumble.

56
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,041
Huh?

57
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,500
My name is Kenji Harima.

58
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,750
I'm in love with
Tenma Tsukamoto.

59
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,583
I've tried to tell her
this time and again...

60
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,250
each time,
I've failed miserably.

61
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,666
Meanwhile, to my dismay,

62
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,208
I've discovered that Tenma
is in love with Karasuma,

63
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,250
the absolute biggest
freak in our class...!

64
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,833
What does she see in him?!

65
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,791
In complete despair,
I started drawing comic books.

66
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,916
But then disaster struck again.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,125
The artist I most
admired, Jo Nijo,

68
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,166
turned out to be
that jerk Karasuma!

69
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,666
What's more, my beard was
cut off, I was shaved bald,

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,041
and I ended up in
a romantic mix-up

71
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,708
with that blonde rich girl!

72
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,458
Finally, I fled
to the high seas...

73
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,458
where I met the man who taught
me the truth about life...!

74
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,583
I was reborn, and returned
home to draw the comic book

75
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,875
of my heart with the pen
I received from my master...!

76
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,041
I had finally
become a real man...

77
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,666
ready once again to
express my love to Tenma!

78
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey Nara!

79
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,291
Huh?

80
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,583
Go get me a cup of coffee.

81
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,041
Uh... sure...

82
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,958
Yoshidayama... you really
shouldn't be sitting there.

83
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,250
Chill, willya...? Harima
hasn't been around for days!

84
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,208
Harima, good to
see you again...!

85
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,083
I was just making sure your
seat was nice and warm for you!

86
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,583
'Preciate it.

87
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,791
I have some bananas here,
maybe you'd like all of them?

88
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,916
Oh, yeah sure...

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,958
These things are awesome.

90
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,125
Harima!

91
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,375
How could you even
think of skipping school

92
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,083
this close to
the culture festival?

93
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,916
We're talking
school pride mister!

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,166
Shut up.

95
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,166
Oh, Tenma... where are you?

96
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,791
Harima... got a sec?

97
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,750
Huh?

98
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,666
What is it now, Itoko?

99
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,708
Call me Ms. Osakabe when
we're at school, remember.

100
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,666
This postcard came
for you this morning

101
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,416
and I forgot to give it to you
before you left the apartment.

102
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,833
Dan... ko... sha?

103
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it something
you've been expecting?

104
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,083
It... it... it can't be!

105
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,875
I did it! The New Face prize!

106
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,166
Now's the time
to declare my love!

107
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,875
Where are you...?!

108
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,375
Where are you... Tenma?!

109
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,000
Tenma is up on the rooftop.

110
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,375
Thank you!!

111
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,583
One order of badass
comin' right up, Tenma!

112
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,083
Okay, sure...

113
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,666
I know love is a
personal matter...

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
and far be it from me

115
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,833
to butt into your
personal affairs, but still...

116
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,083
How can you tell me you're going
to stay over at Sara's house

117
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,416
and then I find
out you're really up

118
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,541
til all hours with
Harima instead?

119
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,166
Well, I...

120
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,375
Oh, no! Tenma's Sister is in
hot water and it's my fault!

121
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,041
You know, I've never done
anything with Karasuma,

122
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,083
so for you and Harima to- ahem!

123
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,750
I mean, even if you
are seeing each other,

124
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,500
I don't think that sort
of behavior is appropriate.

125
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,375
No! Tenma, you've
got it all wrong!

126
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,416
She was just staying up to help
me meet my comic book deadline!

127
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,333
But that's supposed
to be a secret!

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,416
Agh! She's protecting me!

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,583
Look... Here is your problem,
you're either too nice

130
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,041
or too agreeable to others,
you understand what I mean?

131
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,375
Boys see that and they think
you're easy to push around.

132
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,541
They think they can get
their own way with you!

133
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,333
That's why you have
to be more careful!

134
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,666
If Harima gets out of hand and
turns into too much of an ape...

135
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,791
Then you've got
to lay down the law

136
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,958
and tell him off good and hard!

137
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,833
I'm so sorry.

138
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,000
Aghhhhh! What are
you apologizing for?!

139
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083
Now hold on there,
Miss Tsukamoto!

140
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,375
Harima?

141
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,500
What are you doing?

142
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,375
Harima, this is none
of your business.!

143
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,291
It's between me and Yakumo.

144
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,083
You keep your nose out of it.

145
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,791
But it is my business!
Your sister and I were only--

146
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:06,458
Bananas! Hooray!

147
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,625
Don't think you can
bribe me with these!

148
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,041
We'll worry about the
banana situation later.

149
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,541
Look, I know you're upset.

150
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,958
But there's nothing
to stress about.

151
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,291
I mean, sure, your sister
spent the night at my house,

152
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,416
but that doesn't mean that...

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,583
You spent the night
at his house...?!

154
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,208
I thought you were
just out at a restaurant

155
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,666
or riding on his bike
or something like that!

156
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,458
Ah! No, that is, I mean uh...

157
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,041
We were at Itoko, Ms. Osakabe's
place, that's what I meant!

158
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,333
Oh, come on!
Now I know you're lying to me!

159
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,000
Please Miss Tsukamoto!

160
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,791
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of! Honest!

161
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,375
Look into my eyes...!
Are these the eyes of a liar?!

162
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,375
You're so cute, Tenma...

163
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,708
Aha...! Clammy sweat!!

164
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,666
Oh, no!!

165
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,708
Please believe me...!

166
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,291
Your sister hasn't done anything
dishonorable...! I swear it!

167
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,041
All right then...
I do believe you.

168
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,500
Whoa, seriously?

169
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,375
That wasn't why I was mad.

170
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,375
I was mad because
Yakumo didn't tell me the truth

171
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,500
in the first place,
not because she was out late.

172
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,541
And because
I missed her, you know?

173
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,666
She's my only sister,
she's all I've got.

174
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
Thank you, Tenma...

175
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,875
As long as you understand that,
that's all there is to know...

176
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,500
from now on you two can
live happily ever after...

177
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,083
ha, ha, ha!

178
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,958
Yes!! I'll devote my life
to your sister's happiness!

179
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,458
Uh...

180
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,916
Yeahhh, atttaboy, Harima...
I knew I could count on you!

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,833
Agh!

182
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,416
How did this happen?!!

183
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,166
Hey, Kenji...

184
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,541
are you sure it's all right
if I keep this video camera?

185
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,958
I can't believe you used my name
to enter some stupid raffle.

186
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,708
Why do you do
these things to me?

187
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,583
Well, I never have any
luck when I use my own name.

188
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,750
I feel kind of bad about it now.

189
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,375
Well, now that I've settled
that matter with Yakumo,

190
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,791
it's time for me to get
my head back in the game!

191
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,291
Word up!

192
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,083
So what do you
think of our costumes?

193
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,625
Karasuma's looking pretty
cool, don't you think?

194
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,000
His moves are really
coming along too!

195
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,708
♪ Tonight has such a
graceful crescent moon ♪

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,958
♪ Reborn every day,
every night, shining brighter ♪

197
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,708
You really do
look great, Karasuma.

198
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,541
Yeah!

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,083
Oh yeah!

200
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,750
Wa-hoo!!

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And from there... who knows?

202
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,583
You mean you're
a music producer?

203
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,125
I heard rumors about an amazing
band, but this is incredible.

204
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,833
Want to make your
professional debut?

205
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,666
No... way... you really mean it?

206
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,166
We did it Karasuma...

207
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,375
We're going to have
our pro debut together!

208
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,166
Uh... sorry we don't need you.

209
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,416
Huh?

210
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
You don't sing or
play an instrument, right?

211
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,791
Bumped off by a technicality!

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,500
Karasuma...

213
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,666
He's gonna go away on tour, and
there's no telling how long...

214
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,916
Oh... hey, Karasuma...
Where is everyone?

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,458
They've gone...
Is something wrong?

216
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:37,750
I can't sing well... and
I don't play an instrument...

217
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,541
It makes me a
little sad... you know?

218
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,250
Uh, Karasuma?

219
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,833
Please don't feel bad...

220
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,375
I'm sure there's something you
can do well, Miss Tsukamoto,

221
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,583
if you just think
about it for a moment.

222
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,833
Something that
I can do well, really?

223
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,416
Mm-hm.

224
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,125
Turtle.

225
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,291
Turtle?

226
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,083
Turtle.

227
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,458
Turtle?

228
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,333
Turtle.

229
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,250
Turtle?

230
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,208
Turtle.

231
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,583
Turtle?

232
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,541
Turtle.

233
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,125
Turtle?

234
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,833
I don't get it at all!

235
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,583
Why did he say turtle...?

236
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,041
Karasuma, what
are you trying to tell me?

237
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,333
Sis, about that turtle, what...?

238
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,791
I can't give up...!

239
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,875
This is some sort of hint
to find what only I can do!

240
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Let's see, turtle...
gumbo... turtle...

241
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,958
it can't be curry, can it?

242
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,291
Ah ha!

243
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,250
It's word association...!
I know! Turtle... soup!

244
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,875
Are you okay, Sis?

245
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,083
That wasn't it... turtle,
turtle, turtle stew!

246
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,833
Okay, no prob.

247
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,708
Turtle...

248
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,291
Cake!

249
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:38,875
King Kong!

250
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,541
Curry!

251
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,041
Cacciatore!

252
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,916
Turtle, team, tragedy, piglet,
toothpick, prickly rash.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,750
Turtle, toes, toothpaste,
pasteboard, tiny seed,

254
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,166
mongoose, Mangoku, hot pepper!!

255
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,666
Uh... sis?

256
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,333
Why? Why can't I get anywhere?

257
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,625
What should I do? It's like
I'm under a curse or something!

258
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,458
Wait... a curse... if he's
talking about a curse,

259
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,250
then he must mean
Sleeping Beauty!

260
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,291
I figured it out!!!

261
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,250
The only thing it can
mean is that Karasuma thinks

262
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,625
that I should play
Sleeping Beauty

263
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,041
in the culture
festival this year!

264
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,458
All right then, I'll do it!

265
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,250
I'm not sure I follow you...
but good for you, Sis.

266
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,750
Hey guess what this is!

267
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,833
A turtle.

268
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,625
A turtle.

269
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,250
No, no... this is...

270
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,458
Sleeping Beauty.

271
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,000
Bingo! That's our Akira!

272
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,291
What?

273
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,458
How so?

274
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,041
A turtle creeps...
Sleeping Beauty sleeps.

275
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,625
Oh, yeah! That's how
I figured it out, too... duh.

276
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,500
Yakumo! Are the
box lunches ready?

277
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,916
I tried to make yours just
the way you wanted me to, sis.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,708
Okay, I hate to ask, but can you
deliver it to my class at lunch?

279
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,916
Huh...? But how come?

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Never you mind, never mind...

281
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,125
just do this one
little favor for me, okay?

282
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,458
Well... I'm off to
watch Karasuma practice,

283
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,625
so I'll be seeing
you later, sis!

284
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,000
I hope you'll
forgive me, Yakumo...

285
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,083
if I hadn't called over to
your house the other night,

286
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,750
your sister wouldn't have
found out you were staying

287
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,000
at Harima's place
instead of mine.

288
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,333
That's all right...
it's not your fault, Sara,

289
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,375
I shouldn't have lied to her

290
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,291
in the first place,
it was my fault.

291
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,875
But now that it's
all out in the open,

292
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,291
you don't have to hide anymore.

293
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,625
You can be together in
front of everyone if you want.

294
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,333
What...? It's not
like that, Sara...

295
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,666
Good morning.

296
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,333
Um... good morning to you too.

297
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,916
That was weird...

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,250
You know, maybe Sawachika really
does like Harima, like I heard.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,333
The festival's nearly here...!

300
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,041
This year I'll be starring
in "Sleeping Beauty"

301
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,708
with Yakumo Tsukamoto
of class 1-D!

302
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,958
He is so sad.

303
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,875
He must be the only
one who doesn't know.

304
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,375
What do you think is gonna
happen when he finds out?

305
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,666
And now, I'm off to see Yakumo!

306
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,708
Shouldn't we stop him
before it's too late?

307
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,041
Guess so.

308
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,250
Hey, Hanai!

309
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,708
Yes, what is it, Mikoto?

310
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,125
The culture festival
programs are put on as a class.

311
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,583
Yakumo's not in ours...!
Just give it up!

312
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,875
Ha, ha ha...!

313
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,583
With my powers as
class representative

314
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,666
I'll have no trouble
overcoming that obstacle!

315
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,958
Okay, that was useless.

316
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
Yep. It looks like
it's only a matter of time.

317
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,375
Let the drama ensue.

318
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,416
Still, Eri... he doesn't
give up as easily as you do...

319
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
you have to
admit that, at least.

320
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,666
Will you give that
nonsense a rest already...?!

321
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,750
I told you before
that was Tenma's mistake!

322
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,500
Right, after you injured your
ankle at the athletic meet,

323
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,750
Harima bravely took your
place, led 2-C to victory,

324
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,750
and you were so impressed
by his selflessness,

325
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,375
you got carried away and
ended up slow dancing with him.

326
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,250
Yeah, well, as long as
we got that straight.

327
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,583
Oh, of course! We get it!

328
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,708
You know,
She totally wants his bod.

329
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,208
What are talking
about over there?

331
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,666
After six months of planning...

332
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,916
it's been a long journey...

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,375
but now my dreams
will come to fruition.

334
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,833
Hey did you hear about
Tsukamoto in class 1-D?

335
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,458
Yeah... I heard she's seeing

336
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,541
that bad boy
Harima from our class.

337
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,166
Eh?

338
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,291
It can't beeeeeee!!!

339
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,625
And... he knows.

340
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,208
So tragic.

341
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,250
You hear that?

342
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,375
I could've sworn
that was Hanai's voice.

343
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,958
Yeah.

344
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,125
I have a bad feeling about this,

345
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,625
but I have to
deliver this lunch.

346
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,958
Hey... did you guys
hear a scream just now?

347
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,000
We did.

348
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,083
But you're just
gonna make it worse

349
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,958
if you go sticking
your nose into it.

350
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,666
Now, that's just mean, Eri!

351
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,833
Hey... I thought you were
having a box lunch today?

352
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,708
As a matter of fact...

353
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,583
It... can't be...

354
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,333
She can't be seeing Harima...

355
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,083
Tsukamoto... how you doin'?

356
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,416
Oh, hey... I'm doin' alright.

357
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,083
It's Yakumo!

358
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,333
I've got a question.

359
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,166
Yaaa... ku... mooooo!!

360
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,416
Did you really stay over at
Harima's place the other night?

361
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,166
Uh... yes... but it... it
wasn't what you think, Miki...

362
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,000
Come on... you know
how shy Yakumo is...

363
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,000
it's such a chore getting
the two of them together.

364
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,166
This is not good.

365
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,833
I have to clear this mess
up somehow...

366
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,125
Harima!!!

367
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,375
What the hell's your problem?

368
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,000
You are... you bastard...

369
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,625
Yeah...? Bring it on,
four-eyes!!

370
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,125
Hey... what are you doing?
Is this for real?

371
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
Gee, what's the
matter with Hanai?

372
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,958
Aww... man.

373
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,083
It's serious.

374
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,208
Hey, sis...

375
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,208
Oh, you're here...!
I've been waiting!

376
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,375
Hey killer...? You alright?

377
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,708
Hey, Harima!

378
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,541
Go on, Yakumo... Why don't
you give him his lunch!

379
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
His what?!

380
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,166
Uh... okay... here.

381
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,333
Uh, thanks ...

382
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,833
It's packed with
Yakumo's love...! Ta da!!

383
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,250
It's not true...!
It's not truuuuuuue!!

384
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,916
Oh yeah... you're a
lucky guy... Harima!

385
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,541
How fascinating.

386
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,416
Pardon me.

387
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,458
Huh?

388
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,375
Class 2D hereby
formally challenges

389
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,500
Class 2C winner take all.

390
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,916
What do you say we
settle the whole thing

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,916
at the upcoming
culture festival?

392
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,708
Say what?!

393
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,041
You're insane!

394
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,208
The culture festival isn't
just for fun and games,

395
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,416
you know... it's war!

396
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,291
Hey, Ichijou... now it's on!!!

397
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,041
I'm glad you could all make it.

398
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,583
For today's meeting I thought
we would turn the spotlight

399
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,375
on our female classmates.

400
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,458
Neophyte Nara...
have you the materials?

401
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes sir.

402
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,583
The data has been forwarded
to all your personal computers.

403
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,250
Mmmm... So, who is first?

404
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,750
Megumi Sagano...

405
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,541
This isn't well known,
but in middle school,

406
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,916
she was in the
basketball club...

407
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,375
This may account

408
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,208
for the exceptional
shapeliness of her legs.

409
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,208
Yes.

410
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,166
We overlooked that before!

411
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,583
Neophyte Nara...
your work is improving.

412
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,791
Thank you, sir!

413
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,625
Tsumugi Yuki... The only
bespectacled girl in our class.

414
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,375
Oh yeah, she is...

415
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,208
and a valuable asset
to our class as well!

416
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,208
Mai Otsuka, 2-C's
class representative.

417
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,500
According to
information gathered

418
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,083
from a friend in middle school,

419
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,250
she's actually concealing
an enormous bust.

420
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,291
What...? How the
heck did I miss that?

421
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,708
Tenma Tsuka--...

422
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,083
Okay, keep moving.

423
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,500
Mihara Kozue...
The sharpest dresser in 2-C.

424
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,791
Judging from the contact
she has with other boys,

425
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,916
we believe she is
very experienced.

426
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Just look at how her lightly
tanned skin contrasts

427
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,125
with her tan lines!

428
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,625
Commander, I don't think I can
contain myself very much longer!

429
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,250
Calm yourself...
And go get a tissue...

430
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,750
we still have one more
special report to listen to...

431
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,041
Neophyte Nara?

432
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,916
Sir!

433
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,625
Ms. Itoko Osakabe...

434
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,041
Her figure and
style go without saying.

435
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,500
Her intellect and
worldliness create

436
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,416
a libidinous air not
found in our classmates.

437
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,125
It sure does!

438
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,500
But Commander, this is old news,

439
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,500
we already know all
about Ms. Osakabe.

440
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,041
Yes, but I want you
to consider this.

441
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,375
She's an older woman
and a female teacher...

442
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,333
When you combine
these two elements,

443
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,125
her appeal becomes limitless!

444
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,083
She's totally off the scale!

445
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,583
Sir, you truly are a master!

446
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,666
All of our data is
being attacked by

447
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,000
some kind of a virus!

448
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,416
It's happening to me too!

449
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,291
Somebody make a back up!

450
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,041
All of our precious
data is being ruined!

451
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,625
This sucks.

452
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,333
Hey! One file survived!

453
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,416
Quick, open it up!

454
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,750
He shaves it!

455
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,000
It's the culture festival!
Will we do a play?

456
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,375
A coffee shop? Huh?

457
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,666
You mean we're gonna
decide with a survival game?

458
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,458
Next time on School Rumble
Second Semester:

459
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,958
"Strategies, Battlefields,
Friends!"

460
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,333
My Colt Python is
gonna spit fire!
