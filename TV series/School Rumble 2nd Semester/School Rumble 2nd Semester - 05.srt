1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,458
The breathtaking culture
festival starts today!

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,875
And today is Karasuma's
breathtaking birthday!

3
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,208
So what about
this birthday party...?

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,041
Does Karasuma know about it?

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,750
No way, it's a surprise.

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,166
Fuyuki and the others said they
were going to keep it secret

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,416
and spring it on him
later at the launch party.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,958
I've been practicing
baking birthday cakes over

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,666
and over again just for this
day... Oh, I hope he likes it.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,875
Hey, Tenma... do you
want me to hang on

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,083
to that cake until it's time?

12
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,208
Good idea... knowing
me I'll probably drop it

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,375
by accident or something.

14
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,833
I can't wait,
I can't wait... can't wait!

15
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,750
Ahh, very nice... very nice.

16
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,625
There is nothing I like
better than a festival.

17
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,541
Hm... sounds like
things are booming in here.

18
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,041
It's good to see 2-C
finally pulling together...!

19
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,416
I guess my little talk really
straightened them out!

20
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,875
Huh?

21
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,541
What the?!

22
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,583
Hey, Teach, good to
see you, come on in!

23
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,083
What's going on in this shop?

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,750
You're in luck, our
number one girl is available.

25
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,791
Wait a minute!

26
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,875
Here's how it works, you get to
choose your drink and your girl.

27
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:06,666
Huh?!

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,125
I've brought your coffee.

29
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,500
My name's Saeko...
It's nice to meet you.

30
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,666
What are talking about?

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,375
I'm your teacher
we've already met before!

32
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,541
Oh really...? What do
you mean we've met before?

33
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,875
Are you trying to hit on me?

34
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,541
What?! I'm your
teacher! Hellooo!

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,708
There you go again...
you're not going to trick me.

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,041
I hope you enjoy
your coffee, big boy.

37
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,625
Saeko the Hammer strikes
again... another quick kill.

38
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,333
Yeah, the poor guy
didn't have a chance.

39
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,666
♪ Tonight, has such a
graceful crescent moon ♪

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:46,375
♪ Reborn every day, every
night, shining brighter ♪

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,541
♪ She is like something
in the heart of the moon ♪

42
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,166
♪ Reborn every day,
every night... ♪

43
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,166
Oh, what a cute screen saver!

44
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah...? Give me your email
address and I'll send it to ya.

45
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,666
Great... I would just love
to have it on my phone!

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,541
Madoka, this is all
part of the act, right?

47
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,166
Hey... am I unattractive?

48
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,333
Huh?

49
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,625
I just feel like...
I'm no good at this.

50
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,041
Relax, you just haven't
hit your stride yet.

51
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:27,916
That's right...

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,208
It's getting so crazy out there

53
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,250
you're letting the
stress get to you.

54
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,666
Mm.

55
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,416
Hey, Tenma...
Mama wants to see you.

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,875
Oh, right!

57
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,291
Tsukamoto... I understand you're
feeling a little depressed

58
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,333
over not getting any orders.

59
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,125
Yes... I don't think
I'm right for this job.

60
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,291
You're just like I was
in my younger days.

61
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,333
Huh...? But we're the same...

62
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,208
Shh, Don't question it...

63
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,416
Like you I was
once very introverted

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,083
and didn't believe
in myself at all.

65
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,750
But remember this, Tenma...

66
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,250
You have a special type of
charm that's your very own.

67
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,083
Never give up.

68
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,416
I'll be waiting for the time

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,625
when you're the brightest
star in the whole shop.

70
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,250
Mama...! I'll never say
I'm going to quit again!

71
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,041
Hey, we could use some help
back here in the real world.

72
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,958
Everyone!

73
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,916
We've finally reached
our morning quota...!

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,916
Please keep up the
good work this afternoon!

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,250
Yes, ma'am!

76
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,750
They're all on board!

77
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,583
Well done! This is amazing!

78
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,125
If we can keep this up,

79
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,416
we're gonna be number one in
sales for the whole festival!

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,083
Hey! Bad news!

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,458
Huh?!

82
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,541
All of a sudden our customers
have stopped coming!

83
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,791
Say what?!

84
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,291
Everybody's going over
to the tea club's café!

85
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,250
What?! The tea club's café?!

86
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,083
Gee, this place looks
pretty intimidating...

87
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,916
No! I swore!

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
For the sake of my
fellow brothers-in-arms...

89
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,583
I will go in and face the enemy!

90
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,875
It's so good to see
you again, master.

91
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,250
I hope that you had a safe
and pleasant journey.

92
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,000
He's late!

93
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,416
Something's gone wrong!

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,583
Do you think maybe he could've
blown his cover somehow?

95
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,708
Maybe we should send
someone else to check.

96
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,416
I will go.

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,250
What?!

98
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,958
But first let me say this!

99
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,208
Yakumo is in the tea club

100
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,333
so I'm pretty sure
I won't be coming back!

101
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,625
What good is that gonna do?

102
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,458
There are battlefields
a man must face...

103
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,000
even if he knows
he is going to die...

104
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,375
So for the class
and for myself...

105
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,541
Time for tea!

106
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,541
I'm ready for duty, Inspector.

107
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,750
Officer Yakumo...
let's get to that stakeout.

108
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,208
Yes, Inspector.

109
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,833
And remember, Officer,
brace yourself for the worst!

110
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,250
Yes, Inspector!

111
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,208
Master?

112
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,291
Say it again!

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,750
Master?

114
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,583
Welcome home, dear.

115
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,833
Would you like dinner?
Would you like a bath?

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,750
Duwa!

117
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,333
Duwa...! Duwa...! Duwa...!
Duwa...! Duwa...!

118
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,208
Daddy...! Can we sit
over at the cool table

119
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,375
next with Dozibiron Pink?!

120
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,458
Tell me young girl...

121
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,708
why would you take
up such a profession?

122
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,791
A woman like you is not
meant for this type of work.

123
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,166
It's because of my father.

124
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,375
You see, he ran up
too many gambling debts...

125
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,875
and I was sold
here because of it.

126
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,791
You don't have to worry.

127
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,541
I'm getting you
out of this place!

128
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,208
Really?

129
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,750
Not so fast!

130
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,416
Now... I don't
suppose you're talking

131
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,541
about buying her
freedom, are you?

132
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,916
Not exactly...

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,375
But I'm more than
happy to kill all-... huh?!

134
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,291
How 'bout we play a new game.

135
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,291
Huh?

136
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,791
Hey, there's some mistake,

137
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,375
I ordered the episode 102
of Three for the Kill fantasy.

138
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,708
Oh, yes, I know...

139
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,041
but, see, I just like
having you tied up.

140
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,541
Damn that Itoko!

141
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,458
Making me wash dishes just
because I don't have any money!

142
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,750
I wonder what's
taking so long...?

143
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,583
The New Face Award
notice should have arrived

144
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,750
from the magazine by now...

145
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,125
Maybe they
rejected me after all.

146
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,750
Hey there, lady cop!

147
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,708
How about you
give me your address?

148
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,833
Uh, that's
privileged information.

149
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,666
Aw come on babe,
what's the harm?

150
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,791
Excuse me, weary traveler.

151
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,666
Welcome to our church,
may you find the peace you seek.

152
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,833
Have you come to
have your cursed lifted?

153
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,166
You've been cursed

154
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,458
with the inability to
find a girlfriend, right?

155
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,250
For seventeen years!

156
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,125
How in the world did you know?

157
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,583
I'll take care of this guy...

158
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,708
Here, you take this.

159
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,000
Be of good cheer.

160
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,625
Let us offer up a prayer
that your curse be lifted...

161
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,041
Is this the...?

162
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,458
Hey... dishwasher.

163
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,958
Huh...? What d'you
want... you jerk face!

164
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,083
Your teacher is waiting
for you in the back room.

165
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,041
Huh?

166
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,541
What's the big idea?

167
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,250
I thought she was
the teacher here!

168
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,500
Tokiha Apartment?

169
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
Come in.

170
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,291
Uh, hello, I...

171
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,375
You're running
a little bit late,

172
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,416
aren't you,
assistant artist Harima?

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,916
I can't believe it?!

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,166
This is the holiest place...

175
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,458
...in all of comic book history!

176
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,291
I'm sorry I'm late,
Master Tezuka!

177
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,458
Don't worry about it,

178
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,833
go ahead and start
inking the beta layouts.

179
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,208
Yes sir!

180
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,166
Harima, was it?

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,708
Yes sir.

182
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,250
Tell me, Harima...

183
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,458
How long has it been since you
started drawing comic books?

184
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,958
About three months...

185
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,125
I haven't drawn
anything lately, though.

186
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,166
Why not?

187
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,583
Huh?

188
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,583
What made you decide to
stop drawing all of a sudden?

189
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,250
I guess you could say
that whatever was burning

190
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:20,083
so hot inside of me
just turned to ashes.

191
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,291
Can I ask you...

192
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,041
How in the world do
you find the motivation

193
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,000
to keep on drawing so much?

194
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,083
Well... I, uh...

195
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,708
I try...

196
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,541
I try to think of all the
people who have read my work,

197
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,958
or will read my work, and about
the joy it might bring them.

198
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,625
Your pen name is
Hario Harima, right...?

199
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,083
Why did you choose that name...?

200
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,625
You thought people
would find it amusing

201
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,291
and remember it, didn't you?

202
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,333
Don't give up now...
keep on trying.

203
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,583
Where's Yakumo?!

204
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:09,041
I can't see anything...! I want
the lady cop course again!

205
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,583
Sir! Please calm down!

206
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,916
You had better go.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Huh...? But you...

208
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,500
I'll be fine.

209
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh... okay...
I'll be right back.

210
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,916
Okay, I've had just about
enough out of you, mister!

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,458
Yakumoooooo!!

212
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,083
The new Sumo Swimsuit
Wrestling champ is Yoshidayama!

213
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,791
I rule!

214
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,208
Harima... Hang in there.

215
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,291
Yyyellow?

216
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,791
Hey, Tazawa! Where are you?

217
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,833
The New Face Awards ceremony
is happening right now!

218
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,500
Some butler is
here in your place.

219
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,791
Huh?

220
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,125
Congratulations, you
got honorable mention!

221
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,000
Gotta go, the ceremony's ending!

222
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,208
It's finally here...!

223
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,500
The day that Kenji Harima

224
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,000
is recognized as
both artist and man!

225
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,166
I better call
Yakumo and tell her.

226
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,750
This sucks

227
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,500
All of our waitresses
have been stolen away

228
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,458
from us by that damn tea club.

229
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,000
You just can't trust
that Akira Takano.

230
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,416
Snap out of it, men!

231
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,250
Let's show the tea club
we don't need them!

232
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,791
We can do it on our own!

233
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,333
And just how exactly
do you propose we do that?

234
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,541
Obviously, there's
only one answer!

235
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,041
Huh?

236
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,666
The boys are just going to
have to wait on the customers!

237
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,791
But we...

238
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,666
No buts!

239
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,541
It is time for the men to shine!

240
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,833
Hell yeah!

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,583
That didn't work at all.

242
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,208
I can't believe we managed
to lose Imadori and Asou

243
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,375
to the tea club.

244
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,500
Me either...

245
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,041
For a minute there
I really thought

246
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,500
we could pull this thing off.

247
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,708
Sorry to keep you waiting!

248
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,041
Huh?

249
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,250
We stopped off and bought
some snacks and stuff

250
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,791
with the first
half of the proceeds.

251
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,166
Let's all celebrate
the end of the first day!

252
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,291
Aw, thank you guys...

253
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,750
No more sad panda faces...
cheer up and let's party!

254
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,458
Yakumo! I'm here for the cake!

255
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,791
Ha-ri-ma?

256
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,375
Uh... okay, about this, Harima
had some good news today...

257
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,500
and it turns out the
tea club had an extra cake...

258
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,041
Don't explain...
that's just fine.

259
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,375
N-no, it's not what you think...

260
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,875
Okay, don't worry about it,

261
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,750
I'll take both cakes to
the party... See you later.

262
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,125
Okey-dokey, here we go,

263
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,416
I'll just put the
cakes down right here...

264
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,625
I have to make sure not to
mix mine up with Yakumo's...

265
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,333
Tenma...! This is my
chance to confess my love!

266
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
Ten... maaa!

267
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:14,291
Wait for meee!

268
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,083
Oh man, what the heck was that?!

269
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,083
Hm...?

270
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,708
Oh crap!...! That's the
cake Tenma set down

271
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,125
just a second ago!

272
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,875
Wait those letters
"M-A" couldn't mean...

273
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,458
The "ma" in Harima?!

274
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,708
Of course!

275
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,958
Yakumo must have told
Tenma about my award,

276
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,583
and she went and made
a cake to celebrate...!

277
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,833
That's so sweet...! But...

278
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,750
I took the cake Tenma
poured her heart into and...

279
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,916
Ah, crap!!!

280
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,500
Only one option...

281
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,291
Good job, everybody!

282
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,250
Good job!

283
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,083
Yeah, good job , woo-hoo.

284
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,291
Listen up, everyone!

285
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,583
Huh?

286
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,833
There are still more
congratulations in order!

287
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,083
Tenma is such a blabbermouth...!

288
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,416
Well, it won't be so bad having
everyone celebrate with us.

289
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,166
Today is also... our own
Oji Karasuma's birthday!!

290
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,041
Say what?

291
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,083
Say what??

292
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,833
Alright! Then let's party!

293
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,083
It's Karasuma's birthday?!

294
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,291
Thanks a lot, everybody.

295
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,458
Okay, that's enough
with the speeches,

296
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,958
it's time for some cake!

297
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,083
Oh no! If the Harima cake
shows up now, I'm in trouble!

298
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,958
Hope everyone's hungry!

299
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,833
That's it...! I only
have one chance left!

300
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,333
Whoopsie!!

301
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,666
Oh no! I'm just so clumsy!

302
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,583
I'm sorry, Tenma...

303
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,333
this was the only way.

304
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,166
Harima, how could you?!

305
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,500
Huh?

306
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,083
That was my Swimsuit Sumo
wrestling victory cake!

307
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,875
That was uncalled for!

308
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,375
Yeah, even if it
was Yoshidayama,

309
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,250
that was going too far!

310
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,416
Sorry...

311
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,541
I thought it was my cake
and I got excited.

312
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,708
Really, Harima,
I know you're worked up,

313
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,458
but show some restraint!

314
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,291
Don't worry, I have
yours is right here.

315
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,875
Huh?

316
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,333
I heard you had something good
happen to you... here you go.

317
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,958
You are the golden light
of cosmic awesome!

318
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,625
Delicious!
This is beyond delicious!

319
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,416
Kenji Harima is now
one wickedly happy dude!

320
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,083
Oh, sorry about before...

321
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,583
Here, have some of mine.

322
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,041
Aw, look at that.

323
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,541
Yakumo's gonna be so happy.

324
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,625
Now...

325
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,166
We're ready...
for the main event...

326
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,416
the extra special cake I made
myself for Karasuma's birthday!

327
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,583
Voila...! Hm?

328
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,583
What happened?!

329
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,833
It's impossible!

330
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,250
How did Karasuma's cake
turn into Harima's cake?

331
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,833
Tenma, what's taking so long?

332
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,458
Everyone's waiting for you!

333
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,583
I'll be right there,
just hang on for a second!

334
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,458
Okay, but hurry up!

335
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:17,666
That's it...! I have
only one chance left!

336
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,416
Karasuma!

337
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,541
Happy birthday,
and here's your cake!

338
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:38,916
What... is she doing?

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,416
I see.

340
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,833
Why do things like this
always seem to happen to me?

341
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,541
I bet he never talks to me
again as long as I live...

342
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,500
I bet he hates me.

343
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey there.

344
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,375
Oh, Karasuma!

345
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,208
What's this...? A photograph...

346
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,500
Uh...

347
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,250
Well, it's just that before
when we were talking

348
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,291
you said you had trouble
expressing your feelings

349
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,666
sometimes, remember?!

350
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,208
And I wanted to
show you this picture

351
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,583
because I thought it showed
that you had a lot of feeling.

352
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,333
Thanks for what you did today.

353
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,625
Want to walk home together?

354
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,958
Yeah.

355
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,875
Stop tagging along, Mio.

356
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm not tagging along,

357
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,791
it's just my brother's class
is this direction too...

358
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,708
Besides, why are you so eager
to be by yourself anyway?

359
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,291
You don't know anything.

360
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll betcha I know why.

361
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,000
You're going to meet this
Tsukamoto person, right?

362
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,833
What...? How do
you know about that?

363
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,291
Don't you remember?

364
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,000
You told everyone at school
you had a crush on someone

365
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,333
named Tsukamoto at Yagami High.

366
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,375
So there.

367
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,291
Shut-up...! That's not it!

368
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,791
I'm just going to see
my brother, that's all!

369
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,000
He ran off...

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,291
High schoolers...

371
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,000
I wonder if I'll
ever be like them...?

372
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,875
It seems like it's such
a long time from now...

373
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:48,041
I bet that Tsukamoto girl Shuji
likes is really grown-up...

374
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,041
I wish I could be like her.

375
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,291
Hey, Tsukamoto!

376
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
Duwa?!

377
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,666
What should we eat today?

378
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,666
Good question.

379
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,583
Duwa, duwa!

380
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,500
How about dumplings?

381
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,791
Duwa!

382
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,250
That's the Tsukamoto
that Shuji likes?!

383
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,041
No fair...!
I'll never be like that!

384
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,083
I might as well go home.

385
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
That hurts!!

386
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,541
Oh, no, my sweater...! I just
got it and it's torn already!

387
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,666
Man, this is totally lame.

388
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,916
Are you lost?

389
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,333
How old are you?

390
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,208
What's your name?
What's your address?

391
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,208
Any previous criminal record?

392
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,541
Captain... Juvenile Division
can take over from here...

393
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,375
You should get back on patrol.

394
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,791
Hm... maybe...

395
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,041
Wait, there's a suspicious
looking person over there!

396
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,625
What...? Freeze, punk!

397
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,041
There... all fixed.

398
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,583
Thank you very much, ma'am.

399
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,416
She's so pretty...

400
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,166
If I were as pretty as her...
I bet Shuji would...

401
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,958
Hey, Miss?

402
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,583
Have you... have you
ever been all mixed up

403
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,875
over a boy you liked?

404
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,625
See, I... really
like this one boy...

405
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:31,041
but he... he never really
seems to notice me, and...

406
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,458
And uh... I...

407
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,875
Don't cry.

408
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,125
I don't know the whole story...
but I think if you start crying,

409
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,125
you might end up
upsetting this boy too.

410
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't have anyone
in particular I like yet...

411
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,833
But once I do find
that special someone...

412
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,541
I think that I'd want to
be able to smile for him.

413
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,416
I wonder if he left and
went home without me.

414
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,791
I finally found you...

415
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:13,916
Shuji!

416
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,166
You idiot...!
Where'd you run off to?

417
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,083
Were you really
that worried about me?

418
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,083
Huh?

419
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,375
What are you talking about?

420
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,666
If you'd been
kidnapped or something,

421
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,416
I wouldn't have
been able to sleep!

422
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,750
Come on... let's go!

423
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,833
Hey... when are you
going to introduce me

424
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,166
to your brother?

425
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,500
Aw, you're not
missing anything...

426
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,250
When are you going to introduce
me to your big brother, Tennoji?

427
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,166
Well... I don't know...

428
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,541
Okay, you two losers...

429
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,625
You're going to work off
every last penny you owe.

430
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,125
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,708
What's this? 2-C's class play?

432
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,041
Wow, what inspired casting!

433
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,666
And talk about
an interesting plot!

434
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,333
Very nice, 2-C.

435
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,166
Next time on School Rumble:

436
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,166
"Sleeping Beast!
Kiss Impossible! Finale!"

437
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,083
Bravoooo!!!
