00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,583
School Rumble is starting now!!

2
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,541
The elusive Blue Damask Rose.

3
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,375
It is said that when
you place it in the ear

4
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,958
of the one you adore,
your love will be true forever.

♪ Magical Mai theme song ♪

6
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,208
Die!

00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,458
What the--?!

8
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,125
Fire!!

9
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,500
You're mine now, Masked Kamen!

10
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,250
The girl will soon
be mine as well,

11
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,041
now that I have you for bait.

12
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,458
No, please!

13
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,583
Magical Mai will be out of
my way, once and for all!

14
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
I'm Mai Otsuka!

15
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,833
Usually I'm just your average
first year high schooler!

16
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,750
But the truth is, I have a
secret I can't tell anyone!

17
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,625
Hey, Papa! Hey, Mama! Morning!

18
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,125
Good morning Mai! Buenos Dias!

19
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,791
Would you like to run with
me today? It feels great!

20
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,791
No thanks Papa.

21
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,333
It's okay. I think I'll pass.

22
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,500
Okay, then!

23
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,875
You're up! Come and
get some breakfast!

24
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:42,750
All, right!

25
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,791
I am making some papas fritas!

26
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,541
So, this is my
Mother and Father!

27
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,916
Believe it or not, they're King
and Queen of a magical kingdom!

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,291
Mai!

29
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,708
Neko! What are you doing
with the Blue Damask Rose?!

30
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,875
I'm giving it to you!

31
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,666
You can use it however you wish!

32
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,791
Really?!

33
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,625
I'm leaving now!

34
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,958
Be careful out there, Mai.

35
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,000
You didn't eat much.
You want more?

36
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
No thanks. I'm stuffed.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,416
Mai, you have got to tell me!

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,875
Who are you gonna use
the Blue Damask Rose on?!

39
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,000
As if you don't know.
Masked Kamen!

40
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,500
Isn't it obvious?

41
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,416
Uh... The only problem is,
I don't know where to find him.

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,666
He usually appears out of
nowhere when you're in trouble,

43
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,375
But, then it's as if
he was never there, nyah.

44
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,416
I know. It stinks.

45
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,416
Give it back!!

46
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,333
Ha-ha! Everything
you own is mine,

47
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,375
and everything I own is mine,
which makes you a total loser!

48
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,541
Right, Yoshidayama?!

49
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,625
You better listen
to him good, Nara.

50
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,000
I said, give it back!

51
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,250
For such a pip-squeak you have
a really bad attitude, ya know.

52
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
Yeah, let's do sum-in' about it!

53
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,708
Those guys are getting
bullied by that poor kid!

54
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,041
Uh, Mai, try again.

55
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,291
I think you meant to say,

56
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,208
"That poor kid is being
bullied by those guys!"

57
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,125
Yeah, that's what I just said!

58
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,500
Right side, clear!

59
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,541
Left side, clear!

60
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,208
Okay! Let's get magical!

61
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,750
Charm Up! My Mai Dream!

62
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,416
Go ahead! Teach'im
a lesson, Yoshidayama!

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Right!

64
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,125
No! Stop!

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,416
That's enough!!

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,833
I protect the innocent
and punish wrong-doers!

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,541
Magical Girl Mai to the
rescue...! Saving in style!

68
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,625
What is this, Halloween?

69
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,291
Don't you think
you're a little too old

70
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,250
to be wearing that outfit?

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,625
You punks don't know a
superhero when you see one!

72
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,375
Now, now, Mai.
No need to get angry.

73
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,083
They're just children,
after all...

74
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,416
Just for that, all three of you
are gonna get it, ya got it?!

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,041
Wait, Mai! That's not what-- 

76
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,041
Magical Flash!

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,333
No! Not that!

78
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,625
Next time don't wear big white
grannie panties, you old hag!

79
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,416
I will murder you in your sleep!

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,375
Mai... Get a hold of yourself!

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,666
All right--who threw that?!

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,833
Dun! Dun! Da-da-dah!!

83
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,125
And... we're out.

84
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,583
Are you ignoring me?

85
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,958
What are you doing here, Tenma?

86
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,125
Just taking a little side
job to cover my expenses.

87
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,791
You're working?!

88
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,625
Yes! My assignment
was to deliver that letter!

89
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
Oh.

90
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,958
I've been updating
my look a bit lately,

91
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,000
so things are a
little tight right now...

92
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,583
They fell down again!

93
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,458
She probably should've sprung
for the real thing, nyah.

94
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,125
I've gotta get out of here for
another assignment right now,

95
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,708
but if I had any time...
I'd kick your butts real good!

96
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,041
Tenma! This would be
the villain's cue to exit.

97
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,708
Not too bright, is she.

98
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,333
Hurry, hurry!
What does the letter say?

99
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,875
Good question.

100
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,791
What?! Oh, no!

101
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
Greetings, Magical Girl Mai.

102
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,666
How are you? I'm fine.

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,125
Some weather
we're having lately...

104
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,666
Ho-ho, silly me.
I almost forgot...

105
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,166
I've captured your good friend,

106
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,250
Masked Kamen and
I'm holding him prisoner...!

107
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,500
If you ever want to
see him alive again,

108
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,833
I suggest you come
to my magic castle

109
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,458
for a deadly--heh-heh--I mean,
friendly little visit...

110
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,583
Sincerely, the
evil Cartoon King.

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,625
Well, at least I know how
to find Masked Kamen now.

112
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,208
But all of this
life-and-death stuff...

113
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,416
When did things go
and get so serious?

114
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,958
It's a sign of the times, Mai.

115
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,000
You're in high school now,
things change.

116
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,625
Take Tenma for example...

117
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,083
You have a point...

118
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,458
She's really come a long way
since elementary school...

119
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,708
Milky Change!

120
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,291
Marshmallow Tenma is
here to save the day, in style!

121
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
I miss those days...

122
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,541
Back then, a superhero
in a frilly dress

123
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,208
could still get some respect!

124
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,916
I guess it's time for change,
but I'm just not ready yet.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,791
But you can't be a
cutesy magic princess forever.

126
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,291
My Mai--Oh, dear.

127
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,791
What was I supposed
to say again?

128
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,541
That's horrible!

129
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,875
I'll use this rose
tonight, no matter what!

130
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,583
And then--Magical Mai
hangs up her wand!

131
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,750
Yeah!!

132
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,041
I've got a bad feeling.

133
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,916
It looks like a
trap, doesn't it?

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,541
Should we send a scout?

135
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,458
You're right. It's a trap.

136
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,000
And, who are you?

137
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,125
Not important.

138
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,666
But if you run away,
you won't be able

139
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,875
to help your friend, will you?

140
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,875
Sometimes, in order
to do what's right.

141
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,666
One must not be
afraid of danger...

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,458
Wouldn't you say that's true?

143
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,375
Yes, maybe it is.

144
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,500
All right.

145
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,041
We've got ourselves
two new customers.

146
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,208
Tennoji.

147
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,708
Please take them
to table number three.

148
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,791
I'm not hungry. Bye!

149
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,250
This place looks
kinda dangerous.

150
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,708
You're tellin' me.

151
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,416
I'm missing those elementary
school days more and more!

152
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,833
What do you plan to do with her?

153
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Mai has taken this magical girl
thing a little too seriously.

154
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,750
Ordinarily a girl
would give up this kind

155
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,375
of thing once she
was in high school...

156
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,625
I must put a stop to it!

157
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,958
I mean, it's on the
verge of getting creepy!

158
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,250
What about Marshmallow Tenma?

159
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,000
If I remember right,

160
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,791
she's in high school
just like Magical Mai.

161
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,125
Does this have
something to do with her?

162
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,875
This town's not big
enough for 2 magical girls.

163
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,125
You love her.
But, you won't admit it.

164
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,750
Why won't you...?

165
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,166
Why won't you told
her how you feel?

166
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,500
You got me.

167
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,375
But, she's in love with
some other lucky bastard.

168
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,541
Seriously, why did
you scare us like that?

169
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,500
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,666
So, you were getting ready

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,916
to do the final
inspection on this castle?

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
Yes, I was...

173
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,708
Actually, I'm the one who drew
up the plans for this building.

174
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,750
But, you see.

175
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,833
They ran out of money, and
built a lot of things poorly.

176
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,333
Can it withstand rainbow power?

177
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,875
Yes, it does meet the standards.

178
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,875
Did they include
an escape route?

179
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,166
Actually, they did.

180
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,333
Yes! That's awesome!

181
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,416
Out of my way, villains!

182
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,041
Let 'em have it, Mai!!

183
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,958
Let's get magical!

184
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,416
What's happening to
my mighty fortress?!

185
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,750
Thank goodness we made
it out of there alive...

186
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,500
Where the heck are we?

187
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,750
Oh, no! Masked Kamen!
Are we too late?

188
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,875
That's nasty.

189
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,375
You really should do something
about that outfit, y'know.

190
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,916
What?!

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,875
You're the one who looks like
a prostitute in Candy Land!

192
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,750
Is he making fun of my outfit?

193
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,375
'Cause I'm not the
one wearing a diaper.

194
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,458
Yeah.

195
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,500
A loin cloth is
man's badge of honor!

196
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,375
Shut up, you masked pervert!

197
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,250
No!

198
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,500
And my name's the Cartoon King!

199
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,333
You miserable little...

200
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,791
you've got a lot
of nerve, missy...

201
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,541
Have to forgotten that
I've got a hostage over here?!

202
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,041
I asked you not to tie me
up with your loincloth!

203
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,583
Don't let it bother you so much,
we're both men aren't we?

204
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,208
Yeah, and it's awkward!

205
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
You're too narrow-minded
for your own good!

206
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,083
Experiment, geez!

207
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,208
Masked Kamen! I'm coming!

208
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,791
Put that away!

209
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,458
Hey! Are you busy?

210
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,833
I was down at accounting,

211
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,291
but no one was there,
so I came up here.

212
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,541
Karasuma?!

213
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,541
Are you one of them?

214
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,083
Well I could ask you
the same thing!

215
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,166
You're so stupid!
They keep falling down!

216
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,458
Miss Tsukamoto...
I really like your outfit.

217
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,541
Tenma. You've lost your dignity,

218
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,291
but you haven't
lost my affections...

219
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
Now we settle this!

220
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,833
You're gonna lose your dignity,
if you don't cover up!

221
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,000
If you want to save
Masked Kamen, then follow me!

222
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,875
Hey!...! Get back here,
you pervert...! Now!

223
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,916
And, there they go.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I wonder if my
paycheck is ready.

225
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,541
Miss Tsukamoto...

226
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,250
Do you have business
with the Cartoon King...?

227
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,833
I need to speak to him about
the condition of this castle...

228
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,791
Mai messed it up pretty
bad in her attempt to escape.

229
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,458
Anyway, They'll probably
be finished soon...

230
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,333
Will you wait with me?

231
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,500
Yes!!!

232
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,666
Tenma, I'm going to
go ahead and go home, okay?

233
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,041
Take as much time with
Karasuma as you want.

234
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,166
That costume looks good on you.

235
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,541
Oh, you think so?

236
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,791
No! Please don't do
this to me right now!

237
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,833
It's way too loose.

238
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,708
This is so embarrassing.

239
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,291
Don't worry.

240
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,125
I know a very good tailor.

241
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,875
Thank you.

242
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,958
I realize this is
all pretty stupid.

243
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,875
But, I wanna settle
this on my own terms.

244
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,500
Do what you want.

245
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,541
That's enough!

246
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,458
Finally!

247
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,541
Release Masked Kamen! Jerk!

248
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,875
Of course!

249
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,791
But only if you agree to
stop being a magical girl.

250
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,791
It's really very simple.

251
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,083
You shouldn't have
to think too hard.

252
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,958
You've been looking for a
reason to quit, haven't you?

253
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,166
Now you've your chance!

254
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,708
And, you even get
to save someone!

255
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,458
What is this, Halloween?

256
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,750
Don't you think you're
a little too old

257
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,000
to be wearing that outfit?

258
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,250
You have to admit
this isn't a bad offer.

259
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,541
I...

260
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,208
Don't do it!!

261
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,666
You can't give up.

262
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,791
What's wrong with wearing
little girl clothes...?

263
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
Sure you're in high school...
but ya look great!

264
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,041
Well, that was good and creepy.

265
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,750
Thank you, Masked Kamen!

266
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,916
He does have a point!

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,375
What I really need,
is to take you out!!

268
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,416
Hah. And, I tried so hard.

269
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,125
No more Mr. Nice guy!

270
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,458
Loincloth Extend!!

271
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,208
Try and make fun
of my loincloth now!

272
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,375
I'm so sorry. I won't
be able to save you.

273
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,666
Magical Mai, no!!

274
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,375
Masked Kamen.

275
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,333
Huh?

276
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,708
What?

277
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,541
Oh gosh, you can see
even more from this angle

278
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,083
As much as I hate it, it seems
like we're somewhat similar.

279
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,958
Neither one of us can
confess our feelings

280
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,416
for the one that we love.

281
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,958
But, this doesn't mean that
we're friends or anything.

282
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,041
You got that?!

283
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,041
I still have to express
my gratitude. Thank you.

284
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,041
Go.

285
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,958
You really are a
nice guy, you know that?

286
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,875
I don't need to be
complimented by a cat...!

287
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,041
And, I'm not nice.

288
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,416
I now place this in your ear.

289
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,958
The Blue Damask
Rose...! Activate!

290
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:02,916
Mai! What the heck
are you doing?!

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,083
You got it all wrong...!

292
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,833
You're supposed to
put it behind his ear,

293
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,166
like you would with
a pen or something.

294
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,541
Say what?!

295
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,666
I'm telling you the truth!

296
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,458
He could die from
the way you did it!

297
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,291
Oh my god, Magical
Mai is a murderer!

298
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,375
Oh no!! We're screwed...

299
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,916
I guessed correctly...

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,500
You were trying to use some
type of love spell, weren't you?

301
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,666
But you've got it wrong.

302
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,583
If you try and use
magic to win his heart,

303
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,833
it'll never be the real thing!

304
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,541
I knew that what I was
doing was wrong, but...

305
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,333
It's okay. I understand
how you feel.

306
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,333
Holy crap, he's alive.

307
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,208
I'm so glad that
you're all right!

308
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,208
You're the one
who almost killed him!

309
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,958
Magical Mai, I'm so sorry.

310
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,541
I am not able to
return your feelings.

311
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:52,083
I wear this mask to
protect my heart and my eyes,

312
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,625
Because your
beauty would blind me.

313
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,583
Farewell.

314
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,375
Please, wait!
Take off your mask!

315
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,250
I want to see you!

316
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,666
I'm dying to know who you are.

317
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,750
Because you stole my heart,

318
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,041
Do it!

319
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,500
You must know that I
have never let anyone see me.

320
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,166
but because I have been
touched by your confession,

321
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,875
I'll show you.

322
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,125
You bastard!!

323
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,750
I'll make you pay for this!

324
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,750
Once again, evil is
defeated and the love

325
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,916
and peace of Yagami City is
protected by Magical Mai...!

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,416
Go! Magical Mai...!

327
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,083
Soar, Magical Mai...!

328
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,583
Your future is bright...!

329
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
At least, I think it is...

330
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,416
As bright as a star
is at night! Right?!

331
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,416
So what do you think?

332
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,916
Mai's pretty awesome, huh?

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,750
I can't publish this.

334
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,375
Yeah. I guess it's not really
School Rumble material, is it.

335
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:06,500
♪ ending song ♪

336
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,000
Shout it out!!

337
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,583
Bam Star Basketball Gang!

338
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,458
Your comrades have all crumbled.

339
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,208
It's a pity you're
the only one left.

340
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,416
Too bad for you.
The game is over now, Drive.

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,250
I'm sorry Drive.

342
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,291
Sorry I let you down.

343
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm sorry, Drive.

344
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,166
Please forgive me, Drive.

345
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,916
This move will
end you for good!!

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,166
What the blazes...?!

347
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,541
Oh, it's gonna take more
than this to kill my spirit!

348
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,791
We will not be defeated!

349
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,833
Intercept him!!

350
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,333
No, you won't!

351
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,125
I'll attack you with all
of our fighting spirit!

352
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,833
Galactic Bomber!!!

353
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,583
Drive, it's not over yet.

354
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,125
Correct, my dear.

355
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,500
We're back.

356
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,875
And we're not just here
to play some stupid game!

357
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,416
We're going to throw
you a welcome party!

358
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,625
To Hell!

359
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,166
What the...
What happened to you?

360
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,083
This is Deathgate's doing...

361
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,625
You've heard of him, have you?

362
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,125
Then you're not just
an ordinary girl...

363
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,833
It seems I was right to
immobilize you first...

364
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,208
Wait... I don't understand...

365
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:08,000
I betrayed you Drive.
I'm so sorry.

366
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,000
I used your kindness
and good intentions

367
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,500
to draw you into this battle.

368
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,541
I wanted to tell you the truth,

369
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,958
But I was too ashamed
to tell you what I had done.

370
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,958
Shut up.

371
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,500
I don't expect your forgiveness.

372
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,291
I said shut up!!!

373
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,708
What's done is done.

374
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,041
Would you please stop
apologizing already? Come on!

375
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
We're all friends
here, aren't we?

376
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,208
Are we...? Still?

377
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,208
Of course we are!

378
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,583
You should know
that by now, Marippe.

379
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,333
The most beautiful things
in life always have thorns.

380
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,000
According to my calculations,
we'll be friends forever!

381
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,125
Oh, I love you guys!

382
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,375
This is all the reason
we ever needed,

383
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,500
to beat the crap out
of these bad guys!!

384
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,375
That's quite some
nerve you've got kid.

385
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,500
What's happening?!

386
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,166
Wait! Marippe!

387
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,083
Drive, help me!

388
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:10,125
Wickedness Unite!! Hell Judge!

389
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,791
Torso!!

390
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,375
Arms!!

391
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,083
Feet!!

392
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,291
Legs!

393
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,833
And head!

394
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,666
Complete!

395
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,708
The five of us together
are even more powerful!

396
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,375
No, that's impossible!

397
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,625
You're no match for me now!

398
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,250
Please don't hurt him!

399
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,208
You're mine, Drive!

400
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,791
Not so fast!

401
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,791
You will never win this game.

402
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,291
Not while we still
have the will to fight!

403
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,916
You guys!!

404
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,750
How do you intend to fight
me in your condition?!

405
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,583
Just like... this!!

406
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,500
Barrier!

407
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,041
Holy Shnikes!

408
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,625
How pitiful!!

409
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,208
Marippe!!

410
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,625
Listen to me...

411
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,541
I'm going to use my power
to remove the force field.

412
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,500
Attack while the
barrier is down!

413
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,000
Stop it!!

414
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:30,375
That's enough misbehavior!
Brilliant Rose!

415
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,708
Come on! Let's do it, Drive!

416
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:35,791
All right!

417
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,666
Attack at an angle
of 85 degrees!

418
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,250
Okay, let's go!

419
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,333
This can't be!

420
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,875
Here I come!

421
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,166
This time it's
for real! Take this!!

422
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,166
Surefire Slam
with Fighting spirit!

423
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,291
All right, Drive! You did it!

424
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:06,125
Couldn't've done it
without all of you guys!

425
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,458
I'm so glad you're
back on our team.

426
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,750
Don't cry idiot.
You should be smiling.

427
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,375
Thank goodness
everyone's okay again!

428
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,916
I'm so grateful!
To everyone, especially you.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,291
Sure thing.

430
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,833
Oh my. I think
Drive is blushing.

431
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,333
This calculation
equals true love...!

432
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,291
How cute.

433
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,500
Bam Star Basketball Gang!

434
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,291
How are you going to
fight me when you're so tired?

435
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh no, it can't be!

436
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,208
You've finally shown
yourself! Deathgate!

437
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,208
Fools! You're all doomed!

438
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,416
Well, what do you think?

439
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,875
It's pretty good isn't it?

440
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,291
I take dumps better than this.

441
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,041
Yeah. I was just kidding.

442
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,458
It's New Year! It's New Year!

443
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,166
Happy Awkward First Date!

444
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,916
Lions and Goblins Dancing!

445
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,875
Fly the Kite! Fly the Kite!

446
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,000
Round and Round in the Sky!

447
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,041
Fun Games like "Hyakunin Isshu"
and "Hanetsuki"! Oh No!

448
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,916
I got ink on my face!

449
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,708
Bam! Bam! Basketball Gang!

450
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,000
Bam! Bam! Bam!!
