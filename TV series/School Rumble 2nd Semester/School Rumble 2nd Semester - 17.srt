1
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:14,541
Before tonight, something inside
me had already given up...

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,583
But now, that's all changed...

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,750
Am I doing the right thing?

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,750
I don't know anymore...

5
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,083
Well, it appears
that I'm a bit too late.

6
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,458
No matter, I'll put
Masaru on the case.

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,750
Yakumo, I think I feel like
having sushi tonight.

8
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,041
But... I was planning
on making stew.

9
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,708
All right... Sushi it is.
Just let me put this up.

10
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,666
Thank you! You're the
best sister in the world!

11
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay... what kind--

12
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,250
Sis? Where are you?

13
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,375
This is nuts. I should
be working on my comic.

14
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,125
I got a deadline
breathing down my neck

15
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,125
but here I am ferrying
Rich Girl around.

16
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,291
Um, excuse me.

17
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,625
Do you know where we're going?

18
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,500
Well, not really,
just driving right now!

19
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,625
Sorry Mikoto made you do this.

20
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,125
I know you're her
employee, but I feel bad.

21
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,875
Damn right ya should.

22
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,583
So, if I heard right, you're
running away from a marriage?

23
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,166
Not exactly...

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,125
I'm supposed to go to an
engagement meeting tomorrow.

25
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,750
My parents arranged it...

26
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,083
They're forcing me,
even though they know

27
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't wanna
go through with it.

28
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,458
Sounds like you don't
wanna do it, Rich Girl.

29
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,708
You could say no...

30
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,250
Couldn't you?

31
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:04,166
Before tonight, something inside
me had already given up...

32
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,041
But now that's all changed...

33
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,708
Am I doing the right thing?

34
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,583
I don't know anymore...

35
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:18,416
I'm so lost, but looking at the
road in front of me I wonder...

36
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,875
Huh?!

37
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,416
What the hell was that?!

38
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,750
That was Tenma!

39
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,541
But, but what is she doing
with my family's maid?!

40
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,666
Something's up.
I've got to text her!

41
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,166
It's so nice to finally get to
meet you in person, Asou.

42
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,250
Yes, we've heard
so much about you.

43
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,458
You've done so much for Miko.

44
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,083
Thank you, ma'am, you're kind,

45
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,750
but I really haven't
done much at all.

46
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,416
You haven't done anything!

47
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,333
That's my little
spitfire, all right!

48
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,416
Don't be rude.

49
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,458
Asou, I gotta say
you act and look a

50
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,125
lot more mature than
I thought you would. Whoa...

51
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,375
You were saying you stopped by

52
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,875
because you're concerned
about a missing friend?

53
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,125
That's very considerate.

54
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,416
Most kids your age
are not, Asou. That's--

55
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,458
All right! Enough!
This guy isn't even Asou!

56
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
That was painful.

57
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,291
Now that I've gotten
a look at your temper,

58
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,500
I can better understand

59
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,791
why you've had problems
finding a boyfriend.

60
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,375
The only problem
I've got right now is you!

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,458
On the bright side,
I've heard that things

62
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,416
are blossoming
between you and Asou.

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,125
I understand the two of you
had a moment at the arcade?

64
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,791
Argh! Stop talking about my
love life, would you...?! Geez!

65
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,041
How screwed up is it

66
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,666
that even Eri's butler
knows about my dates?!

67
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,208
I hate it!!

68
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,625
I apologize, it's just that Miss
Eri speaks so fondly of you.

69
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,416
Huh?

70
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,000
It's true...
and quite frequently.

71
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,500
I've heard all the stories,
how you enchant the boys

72
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,458
and then pretend like
you're not interested.

73
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,750
How did Miss Eri put it again?

74
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,041
Ah, yes. She said
"OMG she's such a tease."

75
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,208
Dammit Eri, I'm gonna kill you!

76
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,833
Catchin' a cold?

77
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,083
Oh no, I'm fine... It's Tenma

78
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,833
Your maid grabbed me
and put me in your limo.

79
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,750
She sure has big hands,
and a big Adam's apple!

80
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,375
Anyway, she said we're
going to a meeting

81
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,750
and she even called me
"Miss Eri." What a joker!

82
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,000
See ya!

83
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,625
Don't tell me that
idiot mistook her for me!

84
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,500
Somethin' wrong?

85
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,000
My idiotic maid mistook
my friend Tenma for me

86
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,875
and now they're on their
way to my engagement meeting.

87
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,500
Other than that,
everything's great!

88
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,333
We gotta stop 'em, now!

89
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,583
Let's go, Miss...!

90
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,875
I'm gonna make sure neither
one of you has to get engaged!

91
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,541
I don't get it.
Why is he trying so hard?

92
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,125
Hurry! Get on!

93
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,958
All right, if he wants to play

94
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,833
the knight in shining
armor, then so be it.

95
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,291
I'm coming Tenma!

96
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,083
No way in hell you're
getting engaged!

97
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,083
Oh... stop...

98
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,375
I told you, I'm not Eri,
my name's Tenma.

99
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,083
Huh? Menma?

100
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,666
Oh. Miko's texting me...

101
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,250
Eri...? Meeting for
an arranged marriage?

102
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,041
Oh no!

103
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,208
Is that why Eri's maid is
taking me to this meeting?!

104
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,125
That's it!
She must think I'm Eri!

105
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,958
From the looks of her,
she's not too bright,

106
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,708
or very feminine
for that matter.

107
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,041
I've gotta help Eri!

108
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,166
I'll play along and
scare off her suitor!

109
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,875
Um, I need text my sister.

110
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,083
She's probably
worried sick by now.

111
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,583
We have to break
up this engagement!

112
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,250
Dammit! Of all the
times to get a flat!

113
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,666
We don't have
time to be stranded,

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,041
we gotta stop that meeting!

115
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,083
Wait, calm down.

116
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,583
Tenma wouldn't marry
some guy she just met.

117
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,625
But she's so cute,
any guy would propose

118
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,208
like mad to her until
he wears her down!

119
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,500
Crap!

120
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,250
It's freezing in here.

121
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,875
I can't believe he gave me
the only blanket we had.

122
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,458
I wonder how
he's gonna stay warm.

123
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,041
I guess the polite thing to do

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,083
would be to share the
blanket with him...

125
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,583
Ah! But then we'd
practically be cuddling.

126
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,041
Oh god, I don't want
him to get any ideas.

127
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,125
But if I don't, Mr.
Worker Man here

128
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,375
is probably
gonna catch a cold.

129
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,625
What do I do?

130
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,958
Huh? What's up with her?

131
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,500
She looks worried... Oh, man!

132
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,833
Don't tell me she
thinks I'm gonna try

133
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,291
and put the moves on her!

134
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,625
She does! Dammit!

135
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750
Rich Girl's even more
conceited than I thought!

136
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,666
Wait, why am I surprised?

137
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,166
I've seen how she acts.

138
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,208
She thinks she's
the hottest girl in school

139
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,625
and that any guy
would go ga-ga over her.

140
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
Well, guess what?

141
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,125
Your wily charms
won't work on me.

142
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,666
Maybe I should start
with some small talk

143
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,500
and then offer him the blanket.

144
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,500
Um, Mr. Worker Man? So tell me.

145
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,083
How long have you been
working for the Suous exactly?

146
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,500
Uh... Um... A day...

147
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,541
No! I mean... a year.

148
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,625
You look young.

149
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,833
Working your way
through college, huh?

150
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,625
Do you have a girlfriend?

151
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,791
Huh...? No, I don't.

152
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:01,333
Really...?! You're kidding!
What a waste!

153
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,083
Wait, is that a flirty giggle?

154
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,125
Yes! It is! She never
acts this way with me.

155
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,458
It has to be a trap.
She's tryin' to set me up!

156
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,791
Oh gosh, I'm sorry.

157
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,708
That was probably a
little forward, wasn't it?

158
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,041
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

159
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,833
No, it's okay.

160
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,041
Since we're stuck here,

161
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,375
why don't you tell
me about yourself?

162
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,708
What do you wanna
do once you graduate?

163
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,750
Do you have any plans?

164
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,041
Uh!

165
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,500
Damn. Can't tell her
I wanna draw comics

166
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,125
and hope to marry Tenma...

167
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,375
I think I'll work for the Suous
for a while, save some money,

168
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,375
then branch out and try
to start my own business.

169
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,625
You know,
be my own person.

170
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,916
That's my real dream.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,166
Hah! Checkmate, Rich Girl!

172
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,625
Wow, seems like you've
got it all worked out.

173
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,333
What kind of business
do you wanna start?

174
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:45,041
Uh, that's top secret.

175
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
So tell me, how do
you deal with people

176
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,333
who get in the
way of your dreams?

177
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,500
Has there ever been
anyone like that in your life?

178
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,000
You have no idea...

179
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:52,666
Huh?

180
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,416
Uh , I mean...

181
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,041
I can't let things beat me down.

182
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,416
I have to take a
stand against anything

183
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,375
that would try to destroy
my hopes and dreams.

184
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,791
So be strong?

185
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,750
Yeah, that's it, exactly.

186
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,708
This guy is so
different from me.

187
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,250
Why can't I be more like him?

188
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,083
But how do I become strong?

189
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,916
Should I act more masculine?
More grown-up?

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,500
I just don't think I have

191
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,958
what it takes to make
a stand for myself.

192
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,583
Sometimes...

193
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,583
Sometimes there are
things that get me down...

194
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,958
They can be hard to deal with...

195
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,416
But I try not to worry too much

196
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
about the things
that I can't change...

197
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,875
So I just accept them...

198
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,750
I figure if I can't beat 'em,
I'll laugh 'em off.

199
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,333
Wait! Why the hell am
I telling Rich Girl all this?!

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,791
Move over!

201
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,458
Uh! What the--?!

202
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,958
I, uh, didn't want
you to catch a cold.

203
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,416
She's worried
about someone else?!

204
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
That's not like her!
This is freaking me out!

205
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,958
She's up to something!

206
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,291
I'll move... I mean, if
this makes you uncomfortable.

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,208
No, it's okay.

208
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,666
I'll be honest.

209
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,708
I've been pretty depressed
for the last couple of days.

210
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,500
But hearing you talk
about your dreams,

211
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,666
well things are finally
starting to make sense.

212
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,833
And now I feel like I have

213
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,083
the courage to say
what I need to say.

214
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,333
What?

215
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,166
I know it's a lot to ask,
but would you come

216
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,791
with me to my
engagement meeting?

217
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,666
Uhh...

218
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,208
No, no, it's not like that!

219
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,125
I mean, it would just be
for pretend, of course!

220
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,750
You would be there to
help me break it off.

221
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,666
Uh, no?

222
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,750
I know... I should really
take care of this by myself.

223
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
I'm sorry...

224
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,208
But I can't...
I'm not strong enough.

225
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,583
Rich Girl...

226
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,291
All right. I'll do it.

227
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,458
Thank you.

228
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,916
What did I get myself into?

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,708
What? She's asleep
already? Hmph.

230
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,666
Poor little rich
girl all tuckered out

231
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,750
from finally speaking
her mind for once.

232
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,583
Honestly, though, I never
thought you had it in you.

233
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,125
For a second there
you made me think:

234
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,625
Hey, maybe she's not a
totally selfish, shallow, crazy,

235
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,708
spoiled, manipulative,
insensitive, egocentric girl.

236
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,208
But it was only for a second.

237
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,708
It's weird. You actually
look kinda cute right now.

238
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,375
Too bad I'm not even
remotely interested.

239
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,291
Mikoto, what are
you talking about?

240
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,541
Whiskers totally sucks at life.

241
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,916
Moment is over.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,416
Back to being mortal enemies.

243
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,333
Oh? He's not here yet?

244
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,125
Good. We're in luck...
Here's what we're gonna do...

245
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,166
Yeah?

246
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,208
Pretend to be
the guy I'm meeting.

247
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,750
My parents have
never even seen him.

248
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,041
Clean yourself up a bit, and
they won't know the difference.

249
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,041
We'll meet. Then you
break off the engagement.

250
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:09,875
And that's it... So, tell me,
what do you think?

251
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,791
Okay.

252
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,000
Can't believe she actually
convinced me to do this.

253
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,458
This it?

254
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,750
Well, let's get
this over with...

255
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,916
Pleased to meet you.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,208
I'm Eri Sawachika.

257
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,750
I'm pleased to meet you.

258
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,166
Let us discuss our
future, shall we?

259
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,333
Don't worry.

260
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,500
You've got him to back you up.

261
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,750
Everything will go smoothly.

262
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,250
Oh, look at you!

263
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,500
Eri, you look stunning!

264
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,416
Mother!

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,333
What are you doing here?

266
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,875
I wanted... to talk.

267
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,166
Please, dear.
It'll be brief, I promise.

268
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,708
I almost forgot...!

269
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,541
Tenma was already here.
All right then.

270
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,958
I'll just have to work my
magic before Rich Girl shows up.

271
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,166
So, um...

272
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,083
What are your interests?

273
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,541
I draw comics.

274
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,583
I draw pictures, poo!

275
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,458
What the--?!

276
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,666
Is she making fun of me?!

277
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,625
Does she think
comics are stupid?!

278
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,583
Was that too rude?

279
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,500
No, you can't let
this guy take Eri away!

280
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,500
Show no mercy!

281
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,500
Coming here wasn't
easy for you, was it?

282
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
I'm so sorry.

283
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,333
Mother, please, it's okay!

284
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,791
This isn't your fault.

285
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,875
Yes, it is, at least partially.

286
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,041
Mother! Just stop it!

287
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,458
Please forgive me.

288
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,375
Uh, what are your interests?

289
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,791
Rubik's cube. Love it.

290
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,708
I've been engaged lotsa times,

291
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,875
but every one of them
has been called off.

292
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,750
I wonder why?

293
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,125
That should scare him off!

294
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,541
What do you say to that,
Mr. Soon-To-Be-Ex-fiancée?

295
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,041
Please marry me!

296
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
Eri, honestly, if you don't

297
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,875
wanna go through
with this, it's okay.

298
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,625
Mother, don't worry about it.

299
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,541
I'm fine. I promise.

300
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,375
Very well.

301
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,666
Should I tell your father that
you're going through with it?

302
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,958
I guess, since I don't
have the guts to say no.

303
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,916
Did you hear the good news?

304
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,250
We're all in Class 2-C.

305
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,583
Including you.

306
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,875
Nothin' like kickin'
it with the girlfriends!

307
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,625
We need a new pitcher.

308
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,916
When you think about it...
Miko isn't that pretty.

309
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Guess what?

310
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,500
Got myself dumped.

311
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,875
Any guy who'd
dump you is an idiot.

312
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,083
Please deliver this for me.

313
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,583
I can't believe you guys!

314
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
You should've told me none
of you knew how to swim!

315
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,666
You stupid jerks!

316
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,833
We have to beat 2-D!

317
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,291
Take that!

318
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,041
Tenma! Cut it out! That's cold!

319
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,083
Hey! You are so
totally asking for it!

320
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,833
Wait! There's something
I need to say!

321
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,500
If you don't scare him off,
Eri's getting married!

322
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,166
You've gotta resort to Plan B!

323
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,500
Woo-woo!

324
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,791
You know what gets me
goin' on a day like this?

325
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,708
What's that?!

326
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,041
Bumpin' techno beats.

327
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,375
What the--?!

328
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,500
I knew this would stop him!

329
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,166
He's into it?!

330
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,375
Sawachika...

331
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,375
Eri!

332
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,166
Eri.

333
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:58,416
Finally.

334
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,166
Mother... Listen...

335
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,166
I... I don't wanna do this...

336
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,958
And that's my final decision.

337
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,000
Eri, hold on a minute!

338
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,458
Finally. I stood up for myself.

339
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,125
I'm my own person.

340
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,916
How clumsy of me!
I'm sorry, my hand slipped!

341
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,791
It's okay. Accidents
do happen, after all.

342
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,041
This guy's tough!

343
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:40,541
He wants Eri more than Harima
wants Yakumo...! Hey, wait...

344
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,500
C'mere a minute!

345
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,750
What are you doing?! No!

346
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
Hold still!

347
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,416
Mr. Worker Man, it's okay!
You don't have to--

348
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,375
So... The engagement is off.

349
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,500
Understood.

350
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,541
Iori, where's all the tuna?

351
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:18,458
♪ ending song ♪

352
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,250
Looks like Kuta's not drawing
the crowds like he used to.

353
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,375
Well, he's been
actin' up so much lately,

354
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,291
I think people
are scared of him.

355
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,708
Kuta, would you knock it off?!

356
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,833
Mikoto invited me over to spar.

357
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,333
What do you mean
she's "occupied?"

358
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,000
The truth is...

359
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,000
An engagement meeting?!

360
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,333
No! Are you sure?!
That's terrible!

361
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,916
That's correct.

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,791
Miss Tsukamoto and Miss Eri are
both on their way as we speak.

363
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,333
What?! Hanai went after them?!

364
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,500
Please. They're hundreds
of kilometers away.

365
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,083
He'd have to be a lunatic.

366
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,750
Trust me, Nakamura,
you have no idea.

367
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,791
It's Harima, isn't it?!
The rumors are true!

368
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,208
I'm sure you're
being forced into this!

369
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,041
Don't you worry about a thing,
Yakumo! I'll save you!

370
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,166
I don't know how much longer
I can keep on pedaling.

371
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,166
Maybe I can rest up there.

372
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,416
It's a good thing
I packed some food.

373
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,041
I'll have a little dinner
and then hit the hay...

374
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,583
And hopefully not
freeze to death up here.

375
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,541
But I can't...
I'm not strong enough.

376
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,250
Huh?

377
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:56,916
All right. I'll do it

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,708
Somebody there?

379
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,375
Thank you.

380
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,958
Hey what is this thing?
Some kinda blanket?

381
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,458
Oh! It is! It's a big,
warm, comfy one at that!

382
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,333
Somebody in here?

383
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,416
Yes! Over here! Help!

384
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,458
Guess not.

385
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,583
If I don't put an end to
this pandemonium and quick,

386
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,458
I'm going to end up its dinner!

387
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,625
Standard attack strategy
for a big opponent

388
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,500
is to sweep their legs
and topple them!

389
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,166
But that only works for
opponents with two legs!

390
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,166
Damn...! My best attack
strategy will only work

391
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,791
if it stands up like a human!

392
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,375
Thank you!

393
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,875
Down, beast!

394
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,708
Time to finish you!

395
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,958
Oh! Too cute!

396
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,541
Is it morning already?

397
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,375
Can you fix it?

398
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,958
Yeah. I managed to swipe some
tools from that bike over there.

399
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,333
What's wrong?

400
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,708
Nothing! Everything's great!

401
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,875
Are you hungry?

402
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,166
You want some breakfast?

403
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,041
Sure.

404
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,208
I found some food.

405
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,375
I guess it was too
dark to see last night,

406
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,833
but it was right next to us.

407
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,083
Wow. First I find these
tools and then you find food.

408
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,291
This temple's been
good to us, hasn't it?

409
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,500
After escaping last night,

410
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,833
Kuta the Red Panda is safely
back home at the Yagami Zoo.

411
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,083
With his new glasses,

412
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,166
this popular panda is
more precious than ever!

413
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,750
Aw! How cute!

414
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,833
Yakumo, Sara, today we're
cleaning the old schoolhouse.

415
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,416
Come as quickly as you can...

416
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,666
Next time, on School Rumble:
"The Sweet Trap of Work;

417
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,875
The Sweet Trap of the Classroom;
The Sweet Trap of Celebrity."

418
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,666
Penguins, such sad creatures...
