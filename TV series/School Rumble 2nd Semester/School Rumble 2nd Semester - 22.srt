1
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,750
Come on... faster...!

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,791
I can beat him!
The Black Phantom!

3
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,291
Hmph. Nice try, Junior.

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,458
You can run on
home to mommy, now.

5
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:35,500
You're not man enough to
take on the G-1 Phantom yet!

6
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,375
Well, well,
what do we have here?

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,291
Another contender, eh?

8
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,000
Very well, crimson lady.

9
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,375
If you wanna tango, let's dance!

10
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,041
You're hard to catch.

11
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,208
Gotta admit, I'm impressed.

12
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,791
Looks like you're quite
a little filly, aren't ya?

13
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,458
I get the feeling
this is gonna be

14
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,958
a New Year's Eve that
neither of us'll forget!

15
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,375
What the--?

16
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,250
You've gotta be kidding me!

17
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,208
No one's ever beat the Phantom!

18
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,833
What?! You're
actually accelerating?!

19
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,583
Here, on the Yagami Sidewinder?

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,708
Are you nuts, baby?!

21
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,625
You're on a bad stretch of road
whose curves have chewed up

22
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,250
and spit out even the
toughest street racers!

23
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,208
Your skills are inhuman!

24
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,250
Wait! Maybe you're not human.

25
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,125
Maybe you're the Grim Reaper.

26
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,000
Red is the color of death.

27
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,083
So I guess you've
finally come for me, huh?

28
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,583
Fine!

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,166
I'll race you to the
gates of Hell itself!

30
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,041
You're yielding?!
No... You shifted!

31
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,125
Guess your ride can't hold up
to the ocean winds, can it?!

32
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,666
Looks like that underweighted
chassis has turned against you!

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,291
Time for a... Phantom Turn!

34
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,875
Ugh! The sun!

35
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,583
You knew it.

36
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,083
You knew the exact time
the sun would be rising

37
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,291
and figured that
into your strategy.

38
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,875
Didn't think there'd be
anyone that good around here...

39
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,666
And after seeing you,
I don't know

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,750
if I ever wanna get
behind the wheel again.

41
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
Hey, you know the rules...!
No smoking!

42
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,458
Yeah, sorry about that.

43
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,375
I forgot, I was just
tryin' to calm down...

44
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,291
And cut out the backseat
commentary, will ya?

45
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,500
Get your own license if
you wanna yap like that!

46
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,333
First sunrise of the
New Year... We made it!

47
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,666
Great view.

48
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,666
That looks great on you, Tenma.

49
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,500
Thank you, Yakumo!
Isn't it perfect?!

50
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,083
Oh, I wish Karasuma
could see it...!

51
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,125
I wonder if he's going to visit
the shrine for New Year's.

52
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,125
K-Karasuma, there's
something I need to tell you...

53
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,708
and that's Happy New Year!

54
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,125
Happy New Year, Ms. Tsukamoto...

55
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,500
By the way, I love you
in that kimono.

56
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,833
Really?!

57
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,333
Yes. I didn't
recognize you at first.

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,708
I never realized
how beautiful you are.

59
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,458
Come on silly, cut it out.

60
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,208
Quit joking around like that.

61
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,625
It's true.

62
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,291
Tenma... Close your eyes.

63
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,541
Karasuma...

64
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,083
Uh, Tenma? Can you hear me?!
Hey, snap out of it!

65
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,333
Sis! Knock it off!

66
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,500
Harima... Harima!

67
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,125
What the heck? Where am I...?

68
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,041
And how did I get up here?

69
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,958
Harima!

70
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,041
Tenma!

71
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,291
Harima...! Oh, at last!

72
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,125
My love, I've been
looking for you!

73
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,708
For me...?

74
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:38,500
Now we can finally be
together forever, Harima.

75
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,583
Wait, so that means...

76
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,666
You... love me
the way I love you?!

77
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,083
Oh, finally...!
It's like... It's like...

78
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Like... a dream... Dammit!

79
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,625
Why'd it have to be a dream?!

80
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,291
Why couldn't it have been real?!

81
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,500
Wait! Don't people
say the first dream

82
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,791
you have in a new
year always comes true?

83
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,750
All right! Better go pray
at the shrine to be safe!

84
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,833
Hang on, God, I'm on my way!

85
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,375
Uh-oh!

86
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,375
Looks like we've had our
first wardrobe malfunction,

87
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,000
and what a view!

88
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,666
That young lady just won
Swimsuit Sumo Wrestling's

89
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,750
first "booby prize" of the year!

90
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,250
Hey, no "Happy New Year?"

91
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,166
Oh right, sorry...
Happy New Year, Youko.

92
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,916
Why, thank you...
Happy New Year to you, too.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,333
Thank you. I gotta run. See ya.

94
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,250
He's such a loser.

95
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,416
Oh my gosh, I didn't know
there'd be so many people!

96
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,083
In a crowd like this,

97
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,166
I don't know how I'm
supposed to find Mikoto!

98
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,250
Are you all right,
Miss Tsukamoto?

99
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
Karasuma!

100
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,708
Be careful.

101
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,208
It's difficult to
move around in a kimono.

102
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,291
Boy, you're telling me!

103
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,541
It's pretty but it's like
wearing a straitjacket!

104
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,541
So, did you come
to visit the shrine?

105
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,958
I did.

106
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,875
Since we're both here,
why don't we go see it together?

107
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,375
What the hell?!

108
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,541
Is this a joke...? Come on, God.

109
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,166
Gimme a break, would ya?!

110
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,000
I thought my dream was
supposed to come true!

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,541
Oh, right now?

112
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,541
I can't. I'm sorry.

113
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,083
My parents' company
is sponsoring this thing

114
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,458
at the New Year's festival
and I can't get away.

115
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,958
Wait. On second thought...

116
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,333
Lots of people here,
aren't there?

117
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah... I'd watch your step.

118
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,916
I wouldn't want you to fall...

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,666
What?

120
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,041
Oh. Thank you, Karasuma.

121
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,583
He's concerned about me!

122
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,083
And I'm spending New Year's
with him, just like I hoped!

123
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,958
Oh, Karasuma, you're the best!

124
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,458
Your fate is now
sealed, Karasuma...!

125
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,416
You're gonna pay for this!

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,708
Oh, yeah you're going down!

127
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,333
Hello, Harima...

128
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,791
I'm so glad I found you.

129
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,750
The Suou Group is
putting on this thing today,

130
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,791
but something came up
and I have to leave...

131
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,958
You don't mind
filling in, do you?

132
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,708
Yeah right! Now why
the hell would I do that?!

133
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,500
Hey... remember how
you were all homeless

134
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,333
and starving and I gave
you a place to live?

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.

136
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh! Happy New Year!

137
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,625
Hey! Wait!

138
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,958
Thanks for the
guilt trip, Mikoto.

139
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,500
Happy New Year. Right.
It's anything but that!

140
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,125
That's it? How adorable.

141
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,375
Well, better not keep
the other guy waiting.

142
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,666
Hey dude... I hope you haven't
been sittin' here too long.

143
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,333
What the hell...?
Why are you here?!

144
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,750
I was about to ask you
the same thing, Rich Girl!

145
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,791
Oh great... Looks
like Mikoto's at it again.

146
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,041
If I knew you were
going to be here,

147
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,000
I would've never
said yes to this!

148
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,666
That makes two of us...!

149
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,708
I gotta get Tenma
away from Karasuma!

150
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,166
That's so awesome!
Oh wow! Sweet!

151
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,416
Didja see it move?!

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
It's so cool!

153
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
I've never seen one!

154
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,875
So, you guys came
to see the Lion Dance, huh?

155
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,083
Yeah!

156
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,083
Mom told us to get bitten.
It's good luck.

157
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,666
Well... you heard those kids...

158
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,041
I'll help until
Mikoto gets back.

159
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,375
Fine. But you gotta be the ass.

160
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,875
The dancing lion talks, too?

161
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,041
I guess so.

162
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,458
He said the a-word!

163
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,000
Wow, you're actually
pretty good at this.

164
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,291
Hmph... shut your mouth.

165
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,208
Wow. These people really dig us.

166
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,666
A Lion Dance, that's cool.

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,541
I guess it's not
New Year's without one.

168
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,416
Well, what are you
waiting for, Kosuke?

169
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Go let it bite you.

170
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,958
No, that's okay!

171
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,250
Wait! That thing
eats people...?!

172
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,208
So you fight lions
in this country...!

173
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,541
Oh, I could get used to that!

174
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,541
I'm borrowing these!

175
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:27,666
Uh... No, wait!

176
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,291
I won't miss this time!

177
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,166
Lara, no!

178
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,291
It's not real!

179
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,458
It's just two performers
in a costume!

180
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,416
It's a New Year's tradition!

181
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,166
You for real?

182
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,458
Why does it bite people?

183
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,291
There's a legend that
says if you get bitten

184
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,541
by a Dancing Lion on New Year's,
you'll have good luck.

185
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,958
You must've been bitten
by a lion once, Sis.

186
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,208
You're lucky 'cause Blue's here

187
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,083
and you want him
to be your boyfriend.

188
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,125
Kosuke, I'm gonna kill you!

189
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,250
Ah...! Oh no Blue,
you have to save me!

190
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,625
I don't know what he's
talking about, honest!

191
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,875
Damn...! Here I am
getting; attacked

192
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,250
by the Queen of the Beasts

193
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,583
when I should be with
Tenma right now! This sucks!

194
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,875
And it was such a nice dream...

195
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,833
Wanna do that with me,
Karasuma?! That's crazy!

196
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,875
Oh, crap!

197
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,333
Tenma, whatever
it is, don't do it!

198
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,500
I've gotta get her out of
Karasuma's slimy little mitts,

199
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,666
but if I try anything
here, everyone's gonna

200
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,916
think I'm a jealous,
two-bit thug!

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,041
Wow! Hey, Karasuma, look!

202
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,916
It's a Dancing Lion!
Oh, hello, Mr. Lion!

203
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,833
Happy New Year,
you cuddly beast!

204
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,375
Tenma... you are an
angel of the New Year...

205
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,375
Wait! If I bite her,
and she sees inside,

206
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,416
that'll give me
a chance to say...

207
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,041
...I love you.

208
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,875
Harima...

209
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,291
That's it! I have to
give her a love bite!

210
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,875
Yeah!

211
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
I got bitten! Yes!

212
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,541
That's great!

213
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,666
That means you're gonna
have good luck this year!

214
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,083
What the--? Harima...?

215
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,375
Oh no! I-I-Imadori!
Are you okay?!

216
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,625
Viva, leon! With all the
bites you're giving him,

217
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,958
he's going to have a great year!

218
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,083
Oh, no! They're leaving!
We gotta follow 'em!

219
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,208
Rich Girl...

220
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,041
Huh?

221
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,500
So these Lion Dances?

222
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,500
They go parading through
the streets sometimes, right?

223
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,916
Well, what do ya say we go

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,375
spread a little New Year's
cheer to the masses, huh?

225
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,708
Well, I guess so.

226
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,666
But do you think
that's a good idea?

227
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,166
Yeah! It'll be great!

228
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,750
It's for the children, y'know?

229
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,208
Mama... Look!

230
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,125
Kenny, no! Don't touch it!

231
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,916
Is it just me, or are
we freaking people out

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,583
instead of cheering them up?

233
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just you.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,666
So, what can I... get
for you today, "Sir?"

235
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,666
Oh, I'll take a melon soda.

236
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,458
Wow, Karasuma,
that's incredible!

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,125
Your order, "Sir."

238
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,333
Hey, be honest.
What're we really doing here?

239
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,791
You stalking some girl?

240
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,250
How do you Heimlich a lion?!

241
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,458
I love the view from here...

242
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,125
This is where we all watched
the fireworks last year.

243
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,833
Karasuma, you slimy bastard!

244
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,333
So this is where you're
gonna seal the deal, huh?!

245
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,791
Miss Tsukamoto?

246
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,416
Yes, what is it, Karasuma?

247
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,458
Close your eyes.

248
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,875
Oh, Karasuma...

249
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,375
Oh, no, you don't!

250
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,583
I'll feast on
your bones for this!

251
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,000
You can open them now.

252
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,375
Here you go.

253
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,791
I bought this earlier.

254
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,833
I thought it would
complement your kimono.

255
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,875
You look... so lovely.

256
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,875
Why thank you, Karasuma.

257
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh, and Happy New Year.

258
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,583
You too.

259
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,166
Hey, I'm pretty much done here.

260
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,208
Great. Come help me on this one.

261
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,750
All right, all right,
I'm comin'.

262
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,125
You know, this kite
is frickin' huge.

263
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,250
Is it for one of your
diabolical schemes?

264
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,583
You'll see.

265
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,041
Rich girl...
I'm sorry about this.

266
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,500
You make me be the lion's butt,

267
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,291
drag me around town,
drop me off a cliff,

268
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,875
and that's all you can say?

269
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,958
Look, if there was anything
else I could say, I'd say it.

270
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,791
Yeah. Whatever.

271
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,083
Hey. Whiskers?

272
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,166
Yeah?

273
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,583
For what it's worth...
Happy New Year.

274
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,708
Thanks.

275
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,916
Wow! These New Year's
kites are amazing!

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,916
No kidding!

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,333
They're really high up there!

278
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,125
And look at all
the different styles!

279
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,416
Hey, Hanai. I'm about
to launch my kite.

280
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,875
Care to give a girl a hand?

281
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,916
Uh... But can't you
just do it by yourself?

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,666
It's a special kind of
kite that takes two people.

283
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,333
But since you don't seem to
want to help, forget about it.

284
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,791
I'm sure Tougou from
2-D will help me...

285
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,166
Togou?! No-no-no! I insist!

286
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,750
Hey, Kenji, come here.

287
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,916
Now way. I'm not
about to help you.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,458
Oh? Maybe I should
tell you the same

289
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,166
since you haven't gotten around
to paying this month's rent.

290
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,375
Hey, Mikoto?

291
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,458
Is that samurai-looking
one a kite, too?

292
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,166
Yep, sure is. It's called
a "yakko-dako" kite.

293
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,833
Hey, what do you
call those kites?

294
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,083
What the hell are they doing?

295
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,833
Looks like there's
gonna be a good,

296
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,000
old-fashioned kite
fight if ya ask me!

297
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,375
Bring it. One of my
New Year's resolutions

298
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,833
was to finally settle
my score with you.

299
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,291
Come on! They're
manipulating us...!

300
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,000
And you're too
boneheaded to realize it!

301
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,375
Huh?

302
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
Good one!

303
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,083
You jerk! If you want
a war, pal, it's on!

304
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,041
I didn't do that, Akira did!

305
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:57,958
That shut him up!

306
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,833
Ooh, that's gotta hurt!

307
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,500
That's it, douche!

308
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,000
Come and get it, Four Eyes!

309
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,708
What style! What skill!
What grace!

310
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,750
What idiots.

311
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,416
Got that right.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,375
Dammit man, would you
just give it up already?!

313
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,000
And concede to the likes
of a delinquent like you?!

314
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,291
Don't make me laugh!

315
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,833
Akira! It's time for
operation danger hawk!

316
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,041
Uh... I'm on it.

317
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,000
Harima...

318
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,875
Can you withstand
an attack from above?!

319
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,166
Guess we'll have to see!

320
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,041
First I spin like a cyclone...

321
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,791
Then move in for the kill!

322
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,208
Hyakunin Isshu is a
game where someone reads

323
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,000
a verse of poetry,
and the players have

324
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,333
to pick up the card
with the next verse.

325
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,833
So... just pick them up?
Okay, I got it.

326
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,208
"Just like a boatman,
crossing the straits

327
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,708
of Yura without a rudder..."

328
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,541
"Love leads down a path
to destinations unknown."

329
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,416
Found it!

330
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,833
Imadori!

331
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,333
Did I do it wrong?

332
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,833
No... You didn't break the
rules, just Imadori's fingers.

333
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,291
Hanetsuki?

334
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,041
Yep. It's a
New Year's tradition.

335
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,416
You hit the birdie
with the paddle,

336
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,541
but whoever drops it first

337
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
gets ink scribbled
all over their face.

338
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,791
When I'm done, your
face'll be full of ink!

339
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,500
Hmm. We'll see about that.

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
I've run out of places to draw.

341
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,875
Wah! I wanna switch players!

342
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,166
Yakumo, avenge me!

343
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,833
Hm... This should
be interesting.

344
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,250
No offense...
But you suck at sports.

345
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,583
Let's go.

346
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,000
What, you're serious?

347
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,208
All right, your funeral...

348
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,000
What the--?!

349
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,416
Oh! Watch out, we got
a pro on our hands!

350
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,791
Hold on a second! Crap!

351
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,208
Um, I'm gonna
switch players, too.

352
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,500
Harima has volunteered
to fill in for me.

353
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,750
Huh?

354
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,083
What?! Me?!

355
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,958
Why in the hell would
I do somethin' like that?!

356
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, so you forgot
the lion's butt,

357
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,458
the fall off the cliff,
and ruining my New Year's?

358
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,125
You owe me, buddy!

359
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,041
Now go take your medicine.

360
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,625
Hey! Harima says to
draw all over his face!

361
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,333
Yeah. What she said,
just get it over with.

362
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
But I can't!

363
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,500
Okay, seriously, that laugh is
putting me into a hate pocket.

364
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,833
I'm done.

365
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,458
Nice job, Yakumo!

366
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,458
One more game!

367
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,333
Geez, Eri!
What's gotten into you?

368
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,666
Nothing!
Whiskers fills in if I lose!

369
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750
What?! No freakin' way!
I'm done with this stuff!

370
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,583
I wanna draw on him next!

371
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,833
Uh... I mean, we can
keep goin'... Yeah.

372
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,708
It's tradition...!

373
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:07,541
♪ ending song ♪

374
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,666
This is definitely my favorite
New Year's tradition.

375
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,125
Are there really gonna
be lots of girls here?

376
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,708
Aw, hell yeah!

377
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,625
Lots of wardrobe
malfunctions, too!

378
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,625
They're here...! Huh?!

379
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,083
Tougou?!

380
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,875
Hmph...

381
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,000
I was expecting
a bigger crowd...

382
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,791
But it touches me that
the competitive spirit

383
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,250
beats within you three...

384
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,958
Well, men, what say we make this

385
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,375
a New Year's Day that
none of us will ever forget!

386
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,166
Please allow me to
introduce my teammates...!

387
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,208
Come, brothers!

388
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:18,541
Tennoji!

389
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,750
Kuta!

390
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,375
Let us compete!

391
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,166
This is a New Year's tradition
I think I could get used to.

392
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,625
Huh?

393
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:42,458
What the--?

394
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,500
Ichijo! Skating!
Let's go skating!

395
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,541
All right then.

396
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,750
I guess I'll come with you.

397
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:58,958
Why are you here?!

398
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,375
Next time, on School Rumble:

399
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:04,875
"Dream Jumbo. Dream Jump.
Dream, uh, Press."

400
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,083
You tricked me!
