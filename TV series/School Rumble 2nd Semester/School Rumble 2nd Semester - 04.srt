1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,625
Charm up, my "Mai" dream!

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,875
Remember to always
watch TV with the lights on...

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,083
and don't sit too close!

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We'd like everybody
to submit story ideas

5
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,166
for the culture festival play.

6
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:21,333
However...! You're not allowed
to cast yourself in the lead!

7
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,500
We'll take any ideas

8
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,625
that include class
members in key roles.

9
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,416
Mai and I will
assemble the final script.

10
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,041
So we have to accept whatever
casting they come up with?

11
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,000
Wow, we got a lot, didn't we?

12
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,083
Well, at least gives
us a lot to work with.

13
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,000
Huh...? Hey there Mai,
hey there Tsumugi!

14
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,791
Hey, Tenma.

15
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,750
We were just working out a few
ideas for the coffee shop...

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,541
Hope you have fun with the play.

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,166
Thanks!

18
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,791
Well, let's see what we've got!

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,000
Uh...

20
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,083
I never... dreamed we'd ever...

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,541
Oh, Hanai, my love...

22
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
Yakumo, I can't believe
this day has finally come,

23
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,541
I don't know what to say!

24
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,375
It's not Yakumo, silly.

25
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,416
It's me, Kenji Harima!

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,583
I... don't care...

27
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,625
Say what?!

28
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,458
You' are so gorgeous...
so lovely...

29
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,000
Wait a minute! Hold on!
What do you think you're doing?!

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,291
I can't hold back!

31
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,833
I can't fight this
feeling any more!

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,833
Harima...

33
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,625
Haruki...

34
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,750
Hey you guys,
is there something wrong?

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,166
No! Nothing at all!
Nothing at all!

36
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,291
What was that about?!

37
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,333
Don't ask me. I guess it
was someone's idea of a joke.

38
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,041
Ugh, now I can't get
that image out of my head!

39
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
Okay. Shake it off.
On to the next one.

40
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,875
Un, deux, trois... Un, deux,
trois... Un, deux, trois...

41
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,625
Un, deux, trois...

42
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,166
Un, deux, trois...
Un, deux, trois...

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,166
Ichijou...! Mihara...!
What was that?!

44
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,833
Do you expect to
become a prima ballerina

45
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,666
with that kind of sloppy work?

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,916
No, ma'am!

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,166
I'm tired! Don't we get
a break? God(bleep)it!

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,375
You want a break
you pu(bleep)sies?

49
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,666
That's just too bad!

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,541
So disrespectful!

51
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,125
Wait just a moment!

52
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,208
It's Prima Miko!

53
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,958
They meant no harm...!
Don't be cruel!

54
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,208
Please forgive them!

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,625
Fine...

56
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,000
Ah...! Thank yoooooooouuu!

57
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:35,000
What radiance...! She's like
a jewel, like two jewels...!

58
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,291
D-cup!

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,041
I'm sorry, Mikoto...
but with your figure...

60
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,750
And your singing voice...

61
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
we'll never be able
to get anywhere!

62
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,875
We have no choice
but to get ghetto!

63
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,500
Intense.

64
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,708
How's it going, you guys?

65
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,291
Huh...? What's the big secret?

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,666
Sorry.

67
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,708
We just don't want to
ruin the surprise is all...

68
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,333
ha, ha, ha, ha!

69
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,666
Wow, who do you suppose
came up with that one?

70
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,208
Well, maybe it was Saeko,
she gets carried away.

71
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,291
And she's kind
of dark, you know?

72
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,916
All right, then, moving on...

73
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,291
Can I help you... hm?

74
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,416
Yes... um... one bowl of...

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,375
your cheapest soba noodles.

76
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,708
Wait a sec, you were part of the
Sawachika Trust, weren't you?

77
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,250
That seems like
another lifetime ago...

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,750
the company went bankrupt...

79
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,875
and now I'm living this
life of abject poverty.

80
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,166
How many lives did
your company destroy

81
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,000
with its evil business
practices? Hm?

82
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,875
You nearly ruined
my business the way

83
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,583
you ruined so many others!

84
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,083
I know you!

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,208
Now do you understand what's
it like to be poor and helpless?

86
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
There are people out
there who live on nothing

87
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,458
but a bowl of rice
a day and some broth!

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,958
I'm sorry! Really I am!

89
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,875
That twist at the end there

90
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,625
reminded me
of the first story...

91
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,625
Do you think Harima wrote this?

92
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,833
Maybe... he probably thinks
if he appears in disguise

93
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,041
for the first part of the
story it means we won't think

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,333
he's cast himself as the
main character... pathetic.

95
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,416
That so sounds like
something he would do.

96
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
Hmmmm?

97
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,750
I see... so Harima wrote
this little epic, did he?

98
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,458
We're not sure...

99
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,500
Quiet.

100
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,833
Now... now...
it's the culture festival,

101
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,333
I can put my feelings aside.

102
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,000
Mikoto, I have to go take
care of something, okay?

103
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,208
Right... moving
on to the next...

104
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,125
I'm Mai Otsuka!

105
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,625
Usually I'm just an average
first year high schooler!

106
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,250
But the truth is, I have
a secret I can't tell anyone!

107
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,541
Charm up, my "Mai" dream!

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm a magic girl!
And I have special powers.

109
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,375
You know Mai, you would
be a good magic girl.

110
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,916
Whatever! Shut-up!

111
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,541
Let's think about it over night.

112
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,125
It's gonna be hard
pulling all this together...

113
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,750
there must be someone
who's good at doing this.

114
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
Takano, you're still here.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,916
Huh...? Yeah.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,875
Heyyy... Have you noticed that
Takano really likes reading?

117
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,833
Yeah, she'd be perfect
for this. She's so smart!

118
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,166
And she never panics...
she's like, got it all...

119
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,875
"brains and beauty"...!
She's so cool!

120
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,541
What do you think...
should we ask her?

121
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,833
Hm?

122
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,208
Listen, Takano... would
you like to write the script

123
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,541
for the class play?

124
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,458
You can do it!

125
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,250
In fact... you're
the only person who can!

126
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,208
Mm... but I...

127
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,833
Hey, it's a good offer.

128
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,500
You should totally do it.

129
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,166
Easy for you to say...

130
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
I'm no good at
dealing with this.

131
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,291
Don't be silly... You're just
letting yourself get tense.

132
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,416
You're usually the
one with that problem.

133
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
When'd you become Miss Mellow?

134
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,500
I've always been mellow!

135
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,208
But seriously...

136
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,666
You'd be great...
So just do it, okay.

137
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,583
Yeah, I guess you're right.

138
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,583
Wow... I don't think I've
ever seen you smile before.

139
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,791
It's weird... it makes you look
like you're up to something.

140
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,208
It does not.

141
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,333
I'm not kidding...

142
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,125
it's really creepy.

143
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,791
This is what we collected
today and yesterday.

144
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,291
All you have to do is write

145
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,041
a script based on
the stories you like.

146
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,666
All right.

147
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,875
Hmm... What's this?

148
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,541
Once upon a time
there was a girl

149
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,208
who was very anti-social.

150
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:18,666
Her grades were good but
she was a mischief maker...

151
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,833
she was rebellious and
a tease... however...

152
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,958
she had some
extraordinary talents.

153
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,625
She liked to read and
loved to write stories...

154
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,166
she even wrote a
play for her class

155
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,958
to perform at the
culture festival.

156
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,833
Her classmates were
grateful for her talents

157
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,750
and she lived
happily ever after.

158
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,375
Must be Eri...

159
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,041
Good friend,
but horrible writer.

160
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,875
Hey, Harima!

161
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,916
Huh?

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,166
Uh, soba noodles?

163
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,333
Huh?

164
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,458
Please forgive me
for not understanding

165
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,250
what it's like to be
poor and helpless!

166
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,375
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about!

167
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,833
You do too!

168
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,916
You're staying over
at school tomorrow?

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,166
Yeah... our class
is way behind

170
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,750
on getting ready for
the culture festival.

171
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,375
Oh, are you worried
about Harima?

172
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,208
It's all right, don't worry,
just leave it to your sister!

173
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,916
Huh...? What are
you talking about?

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,291
Thanks for dinner!

175
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,875
What did she mean by that?

176
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,250
Huhhh?!

177
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,833
It's simple really...

178
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,291
you just ask Harima what sort
of things he likes and what his

179
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625
favorite type of girl is
and all that sort of stuff...

180
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,208
If I did it, he'd know
I was up to something,

181
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,708
but it'd sound
natural coming from you!

182
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,375
Are you crazy? No!

183
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,625
You really don't
like Harima, do you?

184
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,083
No, Tenma! Not even remotely!

185
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,583
And what brought this
on all of a sudden?

186
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,208
Mm...! Actually, I'm trying
to find out for Yakumo!

187
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,958
You know, she's so shy...!

188
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,833
But for the invincible
battle ship Eri,

189
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,916
this would be
a piece of cake!

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,916
Okay, thanks a lot!

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
Wait a minute!

192
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,625
Wh... what do I do?

193
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,750
Uh, hey, Whiskers...

194
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,916
Huh?

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,041
Uh, yeah, hi,
I'm doing a questionnaire

196
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,208
for the coffee shop
menu and I wonder

197
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,583
if you could take a
minute of your time

198
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,458
to tell me a little
about your preferences.

199
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,833
Huh...? Sure, I guess.

200
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,750
All right... Good job, Eri!

201
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,291
You're... kidding.

202
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,750
Generally speaking,
do you like girls

203
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,791
who know how to cook, yes or no?

204
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,125
What?!

205
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,416
That has nothing to do
with the coffee shop menu!

206
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
Eri must be trippin', yo!

207
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,333
No...! As long as there's love,

208
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,083
cold noodles in a
cup would be fine!

209
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:36,875
I can't believe it.

210
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,250
He actually fell for it.

211
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,791
Good one, Eri...! I sure
picked the right girl, huh?

212
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,125
No comment!

213
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,458
Okay, next question.

214
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,250
Shoot.

215
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,791
Which do you like better,

216
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,708
a girl who's good at
sports or one who isn't?

217
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,291
Either one would be fine...

218
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,333
oh, but it might be cute
if she couldn't swim.

219
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,750
He couldn't mean...?

220
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,500
Uh... next question, Whiskers...

221
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,166
I mean, Harima...

222
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,333
Can you tell me what

223
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,833
kind of hair style
you like a girl to have?

224
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,250
Once again, that has
nothing to do with menu!

225
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,958
That's true, but it's
not like he'll notice.

226
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,375
Wait a minute!

227
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,000
That's Tenma back there...!

228
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,083
So that's it! Now I get it!

229
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,166
She wants to know what
I like...! Heh, heh, heh...!

230
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,500
Silly girl, naturally
I like everything about you!

231
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,541
Hm...! That's a real easy one!

232
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,958
I like girls with
squirrelly lookin' pigtails.

233
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,708
Can you feel my love, Tenma?

234
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,041
Hey... you listening?

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,750
Does he mean it...? He said...

236
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,750
he said he wasn't
seeing anyone, so...

237
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,708
So then you must mean...?

238
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,083
Pig tails... I'm a fiend!

239
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
Hey, sis...

240
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,375
You forgot your things.

241
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,875
Huh?

242
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,375
Good thinking... Yakumo!

243
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,500
What...? What are
you talking about?

244
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,875
Everybody... we're heading
over to the bath house.

245
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,250
Huh?

246
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,708
Woo-hooo...! It's huge!

247
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,250
There it is.

248
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,750
The girls will be right next
door in the next room, naked.

249
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,041
We may not be able to see them,

250
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,375
but still, this is,
without a doubt...

251
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,916
Paradise!

252
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,416
Oh hey... What?

253
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,541
You surprised to see me?

254
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,750
My family owns this bathhouse.

255
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,916
Come on and strip down everyone.

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,750
Relax, I've seen
it all before...

257
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
I'm not looking.

258
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,416
If my hair had
been different then...

259
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,583
I wonder... what
he would have said?

260
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,583
Woo--hoo!

261
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,875
Wow... Karen you
look really great!

262
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,000
Uh, thanks, I guess.

263
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,916
Yeah, girl, you
got a rockin' bod.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,333
You... you think?

265
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,291
You know, this is
still embarrassing.

266
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,916
What? Getting naked
in front of everyone?

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,083
Yeah, it's a little awkward.

268
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,750
Hey, hey, we should
all go in together!

269
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,916
All right.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,708
Right.

271
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,875
Okay, ready, set... go!!

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Ahhh... bathhouses
are the greatest.

273
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,041
They sure are.

274
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,666
Is that a girl over there?

275
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,750
Uh...

276
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,625
can I borrow some
shampoo, Yoshidayama?

277
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,458
Carolyn!

278
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,125
Shall I soap your back?

279
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,750
Yeah...! That'd
be great, thank you!

280
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,208
Hey, you too, Mikoto!

281
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,333
Huh? All right!

282
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,666
This is so relaxing...

283
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,458
nothing matters
when I feel like this.

284
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,666
Hey there Sawachika.
What's up...?

285
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,041
So now that we're
all casual like this,

286
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,708
I wanted to ask you...

287
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,166
what 's the story,
are you seeing Harima?

288
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,583
What? Harima?

289
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,916
Hey, yeah!

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,625
I've been wondering about
that for a while too now

291
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,166
and it's been driving me crazy!

292
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,208
Yeah, come on, you can tell us!

293
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,458
I'm sorry... have you
been waiting all this time?

294
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,458
Ohh... it's all right.

295
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,541
Now come on...

296
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,291
let's head home...
to our cozy flat.

297
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,166
Sorry it's so small...

298
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,500
When I earn more money...

299
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,166
we'll get a bigger
place, I promise.

300
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,458
You silly girl...

301
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,458
your hair got so cold while
you were waiting for me...

302
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,791
Here, let me warm you up.

303
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,750
I love you.

304
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,125
Harima, what is your deal?

305
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,416
Those boys are so noisy!

306
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,875
Okay, if you want my opinion,

307
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,166
I think you two would
be great together!

308
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,750
Yeah, I totally agree,
you guys look so natural

309
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,166
when you're talking
to each other!

310
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,041
So what's the scoop?

311
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,416
Are you guys an item?

312
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,333
Wow, I never knew...

313
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,916
is that how Whiskers and
I look to everyone else?

314
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,208
It's true...

315
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,708
when I talk to him
there isn't any pretense...

316
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,875
or fake smiles...
to be honest...

317
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm surprised by it myself.

318
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,000
To tell the truth...
I think Harima is...

319
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,916
What kind of loser blonde

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,250
puts their hair in
friggin' pigtails?!

321
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,333
What are you talking about?
I don't get you!

322
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,458
A disgusting pig.

323
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,875
You're so right!

324
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,333
Hey, Eri...!
Where are you going?

325
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,250
You're not Eri.

326
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,250
Whoa. How'd it get so late?

327
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,416
Man, I'm starving...

328
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,875
Is there anything to eat?

329
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,833
Hey, girls, why don't we
all make some rice balls?

330
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,833
Yeah! Good idea!

331
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,375
Hey, Nara!

332
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,500
We finally got the Swimsuit Sumo

333
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:03,000
wrestling things ready to go!

334
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,416
Rice ball time!

335
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,875
Man, look at this!

336
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,833
That is quite a
variety of balls.

337
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,291
That's right!

338
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,791
The dishes are
separated according to

339
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,833
the girl who made them!

340
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,958
After you eat them,
you have to guess

341
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,750
which girl made
which set of rice balls!

342
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,166
How am I supposed
to handle this?

343
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,458
Sawachika's balls are mine.

344
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,958
Good luck, Karasuma!

345
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,416
Hey...! That's tasty!

346
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,333
Do you really like it?

347
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,125
'Cause I made that one!

348
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,166
No wonder it's so good, then!

349
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,625
Okay... I have to
find Tenma's rice balls

350
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,791
and say that
they're delicious...

351
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,000
I wonder, could this be it...?

352
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,375
Yeah! No question!

353
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,750
Naturally, I'd be the
one who could tell!

354
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,125
Now, how does it taste?

355
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, I can do this.

356
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,166
Oh, it's even
worse than I imagined!

357
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,625
But if that's Tenma's...
then I'm happy!

358
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,916
Good job!

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,333
Huh...? Hm...? Hmmm... Hm. Huh?

360
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,166
I got through to her!
Good for you, Tenma!

361
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,333
Oh, crap!!

362
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,541
I have to get this
taste out of my mouth!

363
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,708
The shape is kind of weird,

364
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,083
but what the heck,
beggars can't be choosers!

365
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,083
No waaaaaaaaaaay!

366
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,125
Impossible! It can't be!

367
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,666
How the hell could anyone
make something like that?

368
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,083
I can't believe
someone could top Tenma

369
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,375
in the awful taste department!

370
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,708
But then...

371
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,708
that means that Tenma
isn't the worst cook here.

372
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,000
Thank goodness!

373
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,708
Hey, uh, Whiskers...

374
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,500
Huh?

375
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,041
I just wanted to
say thanks for earlier.

376
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,916
Uh... What do you mean?

377
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,083
Would you mind eating these...?

378
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,791
We have to clean up.

379
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,791
You're kidding, you mean none of
these gluttons will eat them...?

380
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,333
No problem.

381
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,083
Ack...! That taste...!

382
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,125
Don't tell me the
first one I ate was...

383
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,833
Okay then, well try
not to work so hard!

384
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,291
I don't even know
I'm doing anymore.

385
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,916
G-got it down...

386
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,583
consciousness... fading...
must get taste out of mouth...

387
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,208
Hey, Harima!

388
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,458
It's Tenma!

389
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,958
Take a break, why don't
you, I've brought you

390
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,291
some refreshments
for all your hard work!

391
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,291
Oh nice timing...!
That's my Tenma!

392
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,166
Here!

393
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
Sweet death come to me.

394
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,750
Yummyyyyyy!

395
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,666
You mean it...? I'm so glad...

396
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,083
you can have them all!

397
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,541
Tenma... you win... you're
the worst cook... ever...

398
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,041
Jab! Jab jab! Jab!

399
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,750
Good work today.

400
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,833
Oh, thank you...

401
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,500
Your hard work did
not go unnoticed.

402
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,125
So are you feeling better...?

403
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,750
Now that you've cleared
everything up with Harima?

404
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,333
Yakumo's not going
out with him...

405
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,750
it was all a rather silly
misunderstanding.

406
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,916
Well... then give
it your best shot.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,875
By the way... how are you doing?

408
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,500
Oh, romantically?

409
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,500
I would... say not that great

410
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,000
I see.

411
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,375
Well, you know, these things
can change in a single day.

412
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,875
So just try to be patient.

413
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,791
How 'bout you mind
your own business.

414
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,583
Well then, it looks
like we'll have to have

415
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,791
a race to see
who pairs off first.

416
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,166
Hey, it's not like
we're in a hurry!

417
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,541
Once I get the prize
for my comic book,

418
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,375
I'm definitely going to
declare my love to Tenma!

419
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,458
Hey everybody, look over here!

420
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,083
Perfect!

421
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,875
Cheese!

422
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,375
The culture festival
will be here tomorrow!

423
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,000
This is it, ladies and
gentlemen, the culture festival!

424
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,916
We of 2-C must
now unite to... What?

425
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,875
The tea club is also
doing a coffee shop?

426
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,250
Next time on School Rumble:

427
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,000
"Hostesses Are Culture,
Comics are Culture,

428
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,541
Cake is Also Culture!"

429
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,125
Where's Yakumo?
