1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,208
It's no use, Captain!

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,041
The helm isn't responding!

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,583
Spineless wimps!

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,583
I don't wanna hear
any whining until

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,416
after we get this
ship back to harbor!

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,833
Yes... sir!

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,250
Captain, I did it, the
engine is running again!

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,166
Son of a bastard!

9
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,083
Look at the size of that thing!

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,041
We're all doomed, there's
no way we can survive this!

11
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,458
I told you before, men
of the sea don't whine...!

12
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,000
Do you know what men
do before danger?

13
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,583
Real men just laugh.

14
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,916
Yeah... yeah, you're right.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,458
Now let's do this like real men!

16
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,916
Right!

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,875
Full speed ahead!

18
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,125
Laugh Dammit!

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,375
Kid...

20
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,000
have you found your
dream on shore yet?

21
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,916
Captain...

22
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,583
Hey, are you still alive...?

23
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,333
Time to get you movin'.

24
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,416
I tell ya, finding
Santa Claus at the side

25
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,166
of the road on
Christmas is pathetic.

26
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,166
I finished it.

27
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:48,000
Hold on...! You shouldn't
be gettin' up so fast!

28
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,333
My manuscript.

29
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,333
I finally finished it.

30
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,833
It ended up being
twenty pages too long.

31
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,875
What're you planning to do
with it now that it's finished?

32
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,958
You'll see.

33
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,666
Tenma... so much has
happened between us...

34
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,750
You... you'll be the
first one to see it.

35
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,791
It's bright today.

36
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,750
Okay, sweetheart,
it's time to open the kiln!

37
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,583
I hope the firing went
well...! I'm so excited!

38
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,333
Hey, Akira, what did you make?

39
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,833
Just a little something
to decorate my room.

40
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,416
As it cools, cracks
will form in the glaze,

41
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
creating a delicate,
artistic pattern

42
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,083
that's exquisite to behold...

43
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,875
not unlike the fine ceramics
they create in the city of Soma.

44
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,833
Oh, hurray, at last
it's finally finished!

45
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,083
Very impressive.

46
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,291
Tenma, is that it...?

47
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,958
Yep...! That's my
Christmas present!

48
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,458
Yello.

49
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,791
Ah, Tazawa...! How's the
manuscript?

50
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,125
Good... I finished it.

51
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,958
Thank goodness...! You need
to get it here right away!

52
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,583
Wait... But I was gonna
show it to someone first!

53
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,041
What are you talking about?
There's no time for that!

54
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,875
It's the end of the year,
the printers are really busy,

55
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,500
and we're on a deadline!

56
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,458
I promise... this
won't take very long...

57
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,541
No, no, y'can't,
if that manuscript is late

58
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,833
you're gonna get dropped!

59
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,583
The Editor in Chief
really likes you,

60
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,708
so whatever you do,
don't let him down!

61
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,125
I'm not exaggerating when
I say your whole future

62
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,458
depends on getting
that manuscript in!

63
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,708
Mitsui, the printers called.

64
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,291
They said to hurry it up
with those manuscripts!

65
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,500
Okay, okay...!
Bring those pages in right now!

66
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,916
I'm counting on you!

67
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,958
My future... he said...

68
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,625
I never even
thought about that...

69
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,208
Do I have a future...? Me?

70
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,125
Why am I even drawing
comics in the first place?

71
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,333
I was such a loser.

72
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,875
Take this, douche!

73
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,625
There were those smart guys,

74
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,291
who everyone knew would
get into a good college...

75
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,208
And guys who
studied art and music...

76
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,541
And me, the guy no
one gave a damn about.

77
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,916
The kid who was
sure to waste away.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,416
I... have a future?

79
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,250
Tenma can read it as much
as she likes later, right...?

80
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,416
If I'm gonna seize my chance,
it has to be right now!

81
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,083
I'm sorry...
Please forgive me...

82
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,875
The snow is expected to
continue well past midnight...

83
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,375
Some areas may receive
locally heavier snowfall,

84
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,583
so please be careful.

85
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,583
In other news...

86
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,500
Hey, I'm home!

87
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,625
Do it! For the curry!
Do it! For the curry!

88
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,666
Do it! For the curry!

89
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,166
For a minute there I didn't
think I was gonna make it...

90
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,958
but I just beat the storm!

91
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:36,125
It turned out a little big...
I hope Karasuma likes it.

92
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,416
Huh?

93
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,625
I'm sorry... I've just...

94
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,541
I've got to do this.

95
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,916
Miss... Miss Tsukamoto...

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,125
What do you want now?

97
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,375
You know this house
is off-limits to you!

98
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,291
You took advantage
of my kindness.

99
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,666
You lied to me.

100
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,708
I can't believe you'd
have the nerve

101
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,958
to show your face here again!

102
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,208
It's... it's useless.

103
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,333
There's no way she'll understand

104
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,000
how I feel by reading
this comic now.

105
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,541
It's hopeless...

106
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,291
If I'm not careful, there'll be
another misunderstanding...

107
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,583
But so what...? Why should
I be afraid of that...?

108
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
Compared to the crap I lived
through before this comic,

109
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,291
and before I met her,
this is nothing...!

110
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,500
Besides... when ya
come right down to it,

111
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,708
I got nothing left
to lose...! Do I?

112
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,916
Tenma... the... the truth is...

113
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,541
I've been drawing a comic book.

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,041
Go ahead! Judge me!

115
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:03,833
Liar.

116
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,875
Huh?

117
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,500
You're lying, Harima...!

118
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,458
No way you would
do something like that!

119
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,541
No, honest,
it's true! Here! Look!

120
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,625
Even if it is true,
why are you telling me?

121
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,166
It's got nothing to do with me!

122
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,750
But it does!

123
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,916
I mean, this is what I've been
doing with your little sister!

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,333
With Yakumo?

125
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,250
Just read the
manuscript... okay?

126
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,958
You mean it's true?

127
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,833
It... it was kinda
interesting... I guess.

128
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,708
All right!!

129
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,583
At long last it's
springtime in my heart...!

130
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,625
Now all I have to do is
deliver this to Dankosha!

131
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
They're going to publish his
story in Weekly Shonen Zinegama.

132
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
You're kidding...! Wow!!!

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,875
I can't wait to see this
thing in print, Harima!

134
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
And thanks to record-breaking
snowfall, we're seeing

135
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,041
major delays on all metro
railroads and on major highways.

136
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,208
Did you hear that? Come on!

137
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,791
We've just received word of a
winter storm warning for Yagami.

138
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,291
We now go to one of our
reporters live on the scene.

139
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,750
Hey...! Iori...! Get your
paws off that remote!

140
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,458
Gimme that remote! Gimme it!!!

141
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,208
As you can see, the snow
is really coming down here.

142
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,250
Despite several
minor accidents--

143
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:06,375
Come on...! I've got to make
it on time... for Tenma!!

144
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,666
Geez! So many obstacles!

145
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,750
Turn...! Turn, damn you!

146
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,166
I love you, Tenma!!

147
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,250
Hurry...! Hurry...! For the
sake of the one you love!

148
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,750
Ride on Harima, ride on!

149
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,583
Was that...?

150
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

151
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,833
Oh yeah, nothin' like a
ski trip to take the edge off.

152
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,583
I could've sworn
that was Harima!

153
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,458
What does that
idiot think he's doing?

154
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,000
Itoko here.

155
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,291
I've got the tea ready...
will you have some?

156
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:17,375
Why didn't he just tell me
about his comic from the start?

157
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,250
I must look like a fool
for hating him the way I did.

158
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,791
I think the reason
you were so upset is

159
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,625
because you cared about him,

160
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,333
and you hated the things
you thought he was doing.

161
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,541
What do you want now?

162
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,000
You know this house
is off-limits to you!

163
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,166
You took advantage
of my kindness.

164
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,458
You lied to me.

165
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,708
I can't believe
you'd have the nerve

166
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
to show your face here again!

167
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,875
Anyone else would have said...

168
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,500
I don't care;
you're still worthless.

169
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,791
Most people are
very unforgiving.

170
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,333
Any slight disturbance in their
relationship and it's over.

171
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,291
No questions asked.

172
00:14:55,375 --> 00:15:00,208
However...
Tenma is not most people.

173
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,583
She may not understand much.

174
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,750
Let's face it,
the girl's pretty clueless,

175
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,291
but she does understand
friendship and forgiveness.

176
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,041
Sis... I think that's
what it is about you...

177
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,833
that Harima likes so much.

178
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,166
Hello...? Oh, Mikoto...

179
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,250
W-whoa, why are you
so excited...? Harima?

180
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,625
Harima was riding
my curry dish?!

181
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,250
Yeah, I was surprised too...!
I got a call from Akira.

182
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,916
She said she'd
take care of it...

183
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,083
What do you think she'll do?

184
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,333
Sis!

185
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,458
Ms. Osakabe?!

186
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,250
Come on... get your sister.

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,541
I heard most of
what's happened...

188
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,583
I apologize in
advance for the driving.

189
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,625
Girls don't let her scare you,

190
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,750
she just likes giving
me a hard time.

191
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,333
Uh, uh-thank you to our
beloved company president

192
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,208
for that inspiring
holiday message.

193
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,083
Uh... we're glad
you could all be here

194
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,541
for the Dankosha
year-end celebration.

195
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,416
Geez, what the hell is
taking Tazawa so long?

196
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,583
The party has already started!

197
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:00,958
What's that?!

198
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,000
Why is Santa riding in a dish?

199
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,750
Don't tell me this
is the entertainment?

200
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,541
Somebody call security!

201
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,458
Mr. Gotou...

202
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,500
Here...

203
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,208
Is that a manuscript?

204
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,291
That Santa broke up the party...

205
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,583
The chief is gonna kill him!

206
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
Looks like he's done reading it.

207
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,958
There's no way
I can publish this.

208
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,041
Take it and leave, now.

209
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:53,833
How could you do this to me?!

210
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,000
Huh...? Karasuma?

211
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,875
Back off...! Let go of me!

212
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,583
Takano told me...
what happened...

213
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,583
Calm down.

214
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,208
Look, they're here.

215
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,666
Hey... What're you doin' here?

216
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,416
Merry... Merry Christmas...
I hope you enjoy it.

217
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,291
Thank you.

218
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,833
Sis, wait!

219
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,250
Wait a minute, you mean
that thing I rode here on...

220
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,833
was Tenma's...?

221
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,458
She made it herself.

222
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,166
Listen, chief...
that manuscript...

223
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,041
I'm sorry, there's
no way I can run this.

224
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,125
This story is far too intimate.

225
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,791
There's only one person
in the whole world

226
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,333
who should read this.

227
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,333
Although, it is a great story.

228
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,541
Oh, Tenma... please
forgive me... please...

229
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,500
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

230
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,166
All I wanted was to
see her smiling face...

231
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,625
Tenma's beautiful smiling
face... that's all...

232
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,250
Harima...

233
00:20:50,333 --> 00:21:01,916
And instead...

234
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,541
Forgive me... Tenma...

235
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,458
Hey...! You okay?!

236
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:46,250
Um... I... I'm sorry
about the dish... honest...

237
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,708
I'm sorry too...
for what I thought before...

238
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,333
and what I said.

239
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,375
Still friends?

240
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,583
Yeah.

241
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:04,458
♪ ending song ♪

242
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,583
Hm!

243
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,166
No matter how rough the storm,

244
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,000
the sun always shines
afterwards... amazing isn't it?

245
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,500
Merry Christmas, kid.

246
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,916
Arise and unite! Dozibiron!

247
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,666
Let's go, Pink!

248
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
Right!

249
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,375
Next time on Invincible
Robot Dozibiron:

250
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,791
"More than Friends...

251
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,000
Less Than Lovers...

252
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,500
Up Until Then."

253
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:06,166
You know, Itchy, I'm surprised
your mom is so... A-hem...
