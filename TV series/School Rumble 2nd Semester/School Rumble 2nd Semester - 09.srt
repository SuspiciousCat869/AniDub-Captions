1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,250
Next!

2
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,375
Right!

3
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,583
What in the world is happening?

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,250
Our peaceful neighborhood
is being taken over

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,083
by a basketball gang!

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:22,750
Next!

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:23,666
Right!

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,375
Next!

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,708
Right!

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,458
Is she gonna be okay?

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,416
Don't worry, you're
going to be just fine.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,791
Oh wow, they helped her!

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,708
Would ya look at that?
They're friendly!

14
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,875
Uh... supper is
ready, everyone...

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,541
so, uh, help yourselves!

16
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,708
Yes!

17
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,125
Another bowl!

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,500
Uh... right...

19
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,041
Looks like Tawaraya's
still off her game, huh?

20
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,791
The harder she tries,
the worse her swing gets.

21
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,416
Hey, Asou...

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,791
can you do
something to help her?

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,916
I don't want to make
things any worse...

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
Wait... did you say "swing"?

25
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,583
We're running out of time,

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,291
you've got to do
something with her.

27
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,458
Try changing up the angle
on your hands each time,

28
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,916
'til you get your
feel for it back.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,166
Uh, yeah okay.

30
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,166
Hey, relax your shoulders
a little, you're too tense.

31
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,916
Okay!

32
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,416
Uh, Ms. Tae... you know she's...

33
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,083
Relax, I've got this covered.

34
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,791
Honestly, I don't know much
about injuries or illness...

35
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,083
...but when it comes
to love, the doctor is in,

36
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,083
and the prescription in
this case is shock therapy!

37
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, are you sure
that's gonna work?

38
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,458
Totally!

39
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,541
Hey, they've stopped practicing!

40
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,458
I'm sorry... I'm totally
worthless at this.

41
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,458
No... it's my fault,
I'm a bad coach--

42
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,125
No, don't say that, you're
the best coach I've ever had...

43
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,958
It's my fault, I don't
have what it takes anymore!

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,375
'S not true...

45
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,541
The boys can't
even keep up with her!

46
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,750
Incredible...

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,125
She's taken everything
Asou has taught her

48
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,958
and put it into practice!

49
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,541
Satsuki! Wait!

50
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,083
Satsuki...! It's not
lunch time yet!

51
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,416
Yeah, your little prescription
is sooo not working

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,958
Oh, dear... I don't understand.

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,250
Hey, Asou...
you should go after her.

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,416
No... she wouldn't
want to see me...

55
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,000
It's better if you go.

56
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,416
Wow, can we say "clueless?"

57
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,500
Eat!

58
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,458
Lara!

59
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,125
It's from my lunch,
just try it... it's good!

60
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,166
No thanks...

61
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,250
I'm not really all that
hungry at the moment, sorry.

62
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,166
You're kidding? Not hungry?!

63
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,541
So what's eating you then?

64
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,166
Everything okay with your dad?

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,916
Yeah, things with
Dad are cool...

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm living with him right now...

67
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,000
but I've got something more
important on my mind.

68
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,500
More important than
food or your family?

69
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,541
How is that possible?
Are you gonna die?

70
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,750
Come on, just tell me!

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,125
If there's anything you need,
you can count on me!

72
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,500
Hello?

73
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,541
Uh, Tawaraya...? This is Asou...

74
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,333
Could you come to
the gym right away?

75
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,083
We, uh... We need to talk.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,750
Look... this has really
been bothering me...

77
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,500
I think we need to
get it out in the open

78
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,916
or things'll just
get more tense.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,083
I want you to be
totally honest with me.

80
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,250
I need to know
how you feel about me.

81
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you mean...?

82
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,125
Are you... you don't... what?!

83
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,208
If you don't like me, I
completely understand how you...

84
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,750
It's not like that at all!

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,875
You see...

86
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,791
I, uh... I love you,
Asou, I love you!

87
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,333
Huh?

88
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,541
Oh...! Uh... actually, I was
asking how you felt about me

89
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,541
as a coach... not... that.

90
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,083
Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupiiid!

91
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,375
Uh... hey!

92
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,208
Looks like Satsuki's not coming.

93
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,250
I can't believe it, she's
never missed practice before.

94
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,125
Asou... you called her
after practice yesterday,

95
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,458
did anything happen?

96
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing.

97
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,125
Come on, Satsuki, you've got
to pull yourself out of this!

98
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,333
They say a lioness
raises her cubs

99
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,041
by throwing them
into a bottomless pit.

100
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,625
They fall down... and down...

101
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,000
and then they grow
strong by climbing out!

102
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,125
All right, people,
don't just stand around!

103
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,125
We have a practice game against
the first year boys today!

104
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,708
Right!

105
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,083
First point's up!

106
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,833
Okay, what's up with the
random guy on the court?!

107
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,291
Damn... he's fast!!

108
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,750
That's cool and all,
but who the hell are you?

109
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,708
Pretty shabby defense,
I guess you haven't learned

110
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,333
that you should never drop
your guard even for a moment.

111
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,583
What a douche bag!

112
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,583
What are you doing
here all of a sudden?

113
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,875
Hey, clear the court, you guys,

114
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,750
we have a practice game with...

115
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,250
The first years?

116
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,041
If you're talking about
this collection of losers,

117
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,666
I'm afraid they're
all played out!

118
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,333
Those has-beens didn't even
make a good warm up for us!

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,458
Whoa... You got
uniforms and everything!

120
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,708
So, what do you guys want?

121
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,708
We're here to
find out if you have

122
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,875
what it takes to
play basketball...

123
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,708
to see if you have
the will to fight!

124
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,958
Basketball is about strength.

125
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,541
If you're gonna be all
pansy-core about it,

126
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,708
then you don't even
deserve to be on the court.

127
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,166
The time has now
come to find out

128
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,541
which team will reign supreme!

129
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,458
Now, are you ready
to take us on...

130
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,708
to face us like
the men we all are?

131
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,041
This is girl's basketball,
you idiot.

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,250
Ms. Tae, would you please
say something to them?

133
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,083
Oh, I'll say something to them.

134
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,708
We... accept your
challenge... Outlaws...!

135
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,208
Now come on, let's fight
them... with all we've got!

136
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,666
Where'd that staff come from?

137
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,958
Why are you on
their team, Tenma?

138
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,375
I thought we were friends!

139
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,333
Sorry, Mikoto, but I'm afraid
we're enemies right now.

140
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,541
Okay then...

141
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,875
if they want a fight,
let's give 'em a fight!

142
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,541
Come on, Lara, use your head,
don't let them provoke you!

143
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,041
What have we been practicing
for all this time anyway...?

144
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,333
For status...? For the
fame...? Of course not!

145
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,083
It's so we can win, right?!

146
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,208
Hey, that's true!

147
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,208
Yeah, like, duh,
let's freakin' do this!

148
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,750
Why not...?
Let's give it a shot!

149
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,875
Aaaalright, let's go...!
Are you guys ready?

150
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,291
It's mine!

151
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,083
Look out, little ladies,
here I come!

152
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Wow, he's really fast!

153
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,125
Way to go, Imadori!

154
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,875
I am a basketball god! And
it's all thanks to the shoes!

155
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,541
I can do anything when
I'm wearing these babies!

156
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,916
I'm borrowing these!
Hey, they fit perfectly!

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,791
Let's just stay cool!
We'll take it back!

158
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,916
You need to pace yourself...!
Be careful, Miko!

159
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,916
Sagano!

160
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,500
Woo hoo, Harima,
that was totally awesome!

161
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,458
Oh no... What in the
world am I gonna do?

162
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,458
This way... pass it to me, sis!

163
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,375
Take it!

164
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,500
Don't worry, I've got it
covered, Tenma's Sister!

165
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,416
I-I'm sorry, Sis, he was
open and you were covered!

166
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,250
Oh, now I understand,
you were faking them out...!

167
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,833
Baby sister, you
are simply brilliant!

168
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,041
Gotcha!

169
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,958
Since when did Imadori
get good at basketball?

170
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:02,833
And Harima?

171
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,208
That came outta nowhere!

172
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,625
Without Satsuki, we can't
get our hands on the ball!

173
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,583
This is so lame.

174
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,041
We need her now more than ever!

175
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,500
Where the heck is she?

176
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,208
Lara... you're not wearing
my shoes out... are you?

177
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,416
Calmate!

178
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,916
I can't take it anymore!
I have to go!

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,416
Wait a minute, Lara,

180
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,000
where do you think
you're going, come back!

181
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,791
Great, Now what do we do... huh?

182
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,458
Looks like it's my turn
to step in, doesn't it?

183
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,750
Uhhhh...

184
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,875
Ichijou, you're
doing it again...!

185
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,666
Suou, you're telegraphing every
time you come in from the right!

186
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,958
What's the deal, everyone is
like, sucking hardcore today!

187
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,625
The deal is, we need you.

188
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,666
Lara, what are you doing!

189
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,416
Listen Satsuki... we're
a bunch of amateurs.

190
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,875
Having a pro
like you on our side

191
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,750
is what made a team out of us.

192
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,291
But I...

193
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,875
I know.

194
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,833
You've got love trouble... so
you can't focus on basketball...

195
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,791
I am right, no?

196
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes. It is tough...

197
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,791
But there is an old saying
I think you need to remember.

198
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,250
Old saying?

199
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Just listen to me right now!

200
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,541
It's "that is that...
but this is this!"

201
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,750
This is something that
you have to do now...!

202
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,083
Everyone is waiting for you!

203
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,625
Also...

204
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,416
I'm waiting for you
and I believe in you...!

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,291
Don't you dare forget that!

206
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,916
You can do it, Satsuki!

207
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,000
Substitution!

208
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,666
'Bout time girl!

209
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,750
I was startin' to sweat!

210
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,125
Thank goodness!

211
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,083
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,541
I did the best I could.

213
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,125
But Suga says I have
five personal balls

214
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,458
and I'm out for the game,
and that I was a traveler too,

215
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,791
or something like that.

216
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,583
Uh... personal fouls...

217
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,041
Okay, girls, let's do this...!

218
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,916
We're gonna win this
game no matter what!

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,333
Yeah!!

220
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,833
Oh, Satsuki...
you've taken another

221
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,291
big step toward adulthood...

222
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,833
It's so beautiful!

223
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,208
Another three
pointer from Tawaraya!

224
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,625
That's her seventh one!

225
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,541
How'd you get her to come back?

226
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,250
Just a little girl
to girl chat...

227
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,541
Now let's worry about
winning this game...

228
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,625
Satsuki is back, and also...

229
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,333
I have these kick-ass shoes!

230
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,541
You're back on your game!

231
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,958
Thanks...! Now...

232
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,083
Let's show these
jerks we're hardcore!

233
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,541
Heads up, Lara!

234
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Ugh... what are you
doing to my shoes?!

235
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,333
Oh...! Foiled again!

236
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,250
Hey...! This is
where you get off!

237
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,166
Sorry for the slip-up!

238
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,375
No sweat,
don't worry about it...!

239
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,875
You and I are homies, right?

240
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,541
Wow, you're so nice!

241
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,500
Is everyone in
Class 2-D like you?

242
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,541
Yeah! There not all
as cool as me, though.

243
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,208
Wow! Maybe I should move to 2-D!

244
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,375
Hey! I'm cool too!

245
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,708
Time out, Regulars!

246
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,875
There's only one way
to turn this around.

247
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,250
We have to feed the
ball to our best player.

248
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,875
Tawaraya...
Can... can you do it?

249
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,291
Yeah...! Bring it on!

250
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,750
O... okay...
Then give it your best shot.

251
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,500
This is bad. We can't
break their momentum.

252
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,583
Well, what do you think
we should do, partner?

253
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,083
Shut up...!

254
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,791
We just gotta hit 'em harder
and don't call me "partner"!

255
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,333
Hey! You guys!

256
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,791
I think it's time for us to
try out my special technique!

257
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,750
You've got to be
really careful, Sis...

258
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,958
That shot's a pretty tricky one!

259
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,416
Yeah, I know it's risky...
but we have to take action!

260
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,000
What does she think she's doing?

261
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,166
It's Bam Star Basketball Gang!

262
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,416
Attack!

263
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,208
Don't worry,
I've already calculated how

264
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,666
to counter their moves!

265
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,458
I'll take care of
these guys. It'll be fun!

266
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
Creepy!

267
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,291
And that's enough out of you!

268
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,375
Hey, take it easy, Imadori!

269
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,583
Aagh! That does it...!
Go, fighting spirit!

270
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,000
Eel explosiooooon!

271
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,583
Galactic... bomberrrrrrrr!

272
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,875
You... you did it!

273
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,291
Way to go!

274
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,958
I sure did...! I couldn't
have done it without you!

275
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,708
But come on, you guys, our fight
here is just getting started!

276
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,916
Traveling.

277
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,166
It's okay, Sis,
you tried really hard.

278
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,291
Two minute warning!

279
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,916
You've gotta be kidding!

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,333
Ho ho! Doowah!

281
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,750
Tenma's on Lara?

282
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,416
What the heck are they thinking?

283
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,000
Doowah!

284
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,208
Move! Stop mocking me!

285
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,666
Offensive foul!

286
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,625
That's five fouls!
Lara has fouled out!

287
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,416
What are you talking about?

288
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,833
I barely laid a hand on her!

289
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,833
Are you blind or
are you just crazy?

290
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,333
The whole thing was just
a trick to foul out Lara!

291
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
We're out of players,
Now what do we do!

292
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,041
Looks to me like we need
to call in our secret weapon!

293
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,375
All right, Tenma, are you ready?

294
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,875
Your time has come!

295
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,750
Are you out of your mind,
Tsukamoto's on our team!

296
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,500
I'm back, everyone...!
Sorry I'm so late!

297
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,583
Tenma... why?

298
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,416
What's happening?

299
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,625
Huh...! Well, aren't

300
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,625
you just the
unpredicatable little kitten!

301
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,958
But hey, that's basketball
for ya...! Let's do it!

302
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,333
You idiot, not only are
you not making any sense,

303
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,250
but now we're one player short!

304
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,791
How about letting me join?

305
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,833
Asou...? You sure?

306
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,750
Oh, yeah... Sorry... I kind
of want to take you guys on.

307
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,333
That's hot...

308
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,875
Bring it.

309
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,916
We've got fifteen seconds
to turn this game around.

310
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
We're gonna have to draw a
foul on this shot to tie it up.

311
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,916
You cross over and
I'll take the right, okay!

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,416
You got it! Just leave
Harima to me, baby!

313
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,416
Tawaraya is on fire today!

314
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,208
But Suou is nearly exhausted...

315
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,041
there's no way she
can keep this up.

316
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,583
She won't pass!

317
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,625
If I cut in on her drive,
we've got them beat!

318
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,250
Yeah! I was right!

319
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,708
Huh? She passed?

320
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,958
In 'yo face!

321
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,291
Damn! Harima, it's up to you!

322
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,166
Defense... defense...

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,458
Someone stop Suou!

324
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,375
A double clutch?!

325
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,041
Incredible! I've never
seen anything like it!

326
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,375
Way to go, Mikoto, you did it!

327
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,875
That was an amazing pass!

328
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,291
Look at that.

329
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,125
I really didn't think
you'd do this well.

330
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,500
A one point difference,
who'd have guessed?

331
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,916
But one point is one point.

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,666
Starting tomorrow,
the court belongs to us!

333
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,666
Ah, I'm so over this.

334
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,875
Uhm, Ten--I mean,
Miss Tsukamoto,

335
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,083
can I be on your team instead?

336
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,041
It's getting late.

337
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,000
I have to go get dinner ready.

338
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,208
I don't understand
this country...

339
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,708
Oops, my bad!

340
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,166
Sorry, they wore out!

341
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,833
What am I supposed to
do with a pair of laces?

342
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,666
Hey, Satsuki, is it true we got
a lot of new recruits recently?

343
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,041
Yeah, a lot of people
who came to watch the game

344
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,625
wound up sticking around
and joining the team!

345
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,958
So much for our five
person basketball club!

346
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,125
Oh, well, that's all right,

347
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,958
at least it was fun
while it lasted!

348
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,166
Lara, it was really nice the
way you helped out Satsuki.

349
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,541
What are you
talking about "nice?"

350
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,750
I just wanted to win the game.

351
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,500
So how 'bout it?

352
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,166
Are you gonna keep
playing basketball with us?

353
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,250
Oh, I don't think so,
I mean, it was fun and all,

354
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,541
playing on the
team with you guys,

355
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,541
but I just felt like an
amateur out there.

356
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,875
What, you have got
to be kidding me...

357
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,125
You were great and you
improved more than anybody!

358
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,875
Whatever, you're
just saying that,

359
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,041
besides, I've still
got my dojo duties...

360
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,041
No, I think Megumi's right.

361
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,458
You've got serious talent, Suou.

362
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,250
If you drop out now,
it'd really suck for the team.

363
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,416
I've gone up against you
and I'm not joking around,

364
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,833
you've got what it takes.

365
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:20,916
Um...

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,833
I... I agree with Asou.

367
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,333
You're sharp, you're tall,

368
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,583
and you're always looking out
for your fellow teammates.

369
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,916
You definitely have
a talent for basketball

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,708
and it'd be a shame
if you quit now...

371
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,416
I mean I'm just
throwin' that out there.

372
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
Uh, thank you...

373
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,291
Wow, Satsuki...

374
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,583
Well, well, if it isn't

375
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,625
my fickle little
heroine of the hoops...

376
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,625
How fortuitous that
I should run into you.

377
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,166
Huh?

378
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,708
Did you mean what you said about
transferring into Class 2-D?

379
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,708
How 'bout it...?
You'd be a utility player...

380
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,625
I'll keep a seat warm for you.

381
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,250
Why that smooth talking
pony tailed S.O.B.,

382
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,375
he's got a lot of nerve
making moves on my Tenma!

383
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,291
Come on, Miko,
just one kiss to show

384
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,791
there's no hard feelings
about the game...

385
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,333
Will you get off me, you idiot?

386
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,708
Oh, Miko, I love it when
you kick me like that.

387
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,791
It makes me hurt so good.

388
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,666
Leave him to me, Mikoto!

389
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,958
Thanks, Lara!

390
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166
Wow! Everyone sure ate a lot!

391
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,333
Hey, Satsuki.

392
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,750
This may be over...
but what about that?

393
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,500
Remember... I am here for you.

394
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,208
So, Tawaraya...
think you can get by

395
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,125
coaching the team
on your own now?

396
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,708
What do you mean?

397
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,916
Are you going back
to boys' basketball?

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,833
It's not really about that...

399
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,416
I'm just afraid that
I might make things worse

400
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
for you by coaching you myself.

401
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,500
That's not true.

402
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,000
Listen, you're a really
good coach, Asou...

403
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,833
You and Mikoto are going
to work great together.

404
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,750
Huh?

405
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,291
Well, I'll let you two finish
cleaning up by yourselves!

406
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,333
Hey!

407
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,666
Huh... the weather's
great tonight...

408
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,416
I'm sorry you got stuck
helping with the dishes.

409
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,250
Hey, don't worry about it.

410
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,416
But seriously...

411
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,833
Will you keep on
playing basketball?

412
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,083
Because I wasn't kidding
about what I said before,

413
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,208
I really do think you're great.

414
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,291
Well, thank you...

415
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,583
I guess I'll have
to do some thinking.

416
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,875
If you do play...

417
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,208
I'd be happy to help
you pick out shoes...

418
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,041
You promise?

419
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,916
Hey there, Mikoto...!

420
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,250
I understand that Yakumo
is playing basketball now!

421
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,875
So what do you say, am I in
time for the next practice?

422
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,416
Tenma! Have you put
on weight recently?

423
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,833
You're eating too much! Huh?

424
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:00,000
On me it's all muscle...
so not the same.

425
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,625
Next time on School Rumble!

426
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,541
"Hee! Hee Hee! Hee Hee Hee!"

427
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,500
Hey! That's not
muscle there, so watch it!
