1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:09,875
This is Ryuhei Suga.

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,750
He's in the basketball club and
is good friends with Asou.

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,041
In exchange for his family's
famous pickled eggplant recipe,

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,875
he gets free ramen at the
Asou family restaurant,

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,291
and also tries to score with the
girls who hang around Asou.

6
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,916
Talk about pathetic.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,166
Hey!

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,000
Why don't we have the
girls' team over again?

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,375
All right.

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,791
Here's your pickled eggplant
and rice bran ramen.

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,333
Uh... thanks.

12
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,750
Yo! The stewpot's
startin' to boil!

13
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,708
Man, it just doesn't
seem like autumn

14
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,041
without a little
sweet potato stew!

15
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,041
Say...! You're Mikoto's
boyfriend, aren't you?

16
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,041
No-no, just her
basketball coach.

17
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,125
Hi... Good to see
you again, sweetheart...!

18
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,208
Made up your mind
to go out with me yet?

19
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,625
Uh, well...

20
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,416
I'm still enjoying being
single, so I'll have to pass.

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,375
Kids...! There's plenty to go
around, so everybody eat up!

22
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,583
The last thing
I need is leftovers!

23
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,083
Yay!

24
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,458
Hey... isn't this your

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,791
first time at a Suou
family stew party?

26
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,708
Yes... are you
sure it's all right

27
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,333
for us to drop in like this?

28
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,916
Of course it is!

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,875
As long as we bring an
ingredient it's totally fine...!

30
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,250
You brought meat, right?

31
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
Huh...? You didn't say
I was supposed to bring it!

32
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Huh?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,166
If you're lookin' for meat,
I got this package.

34
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,375
I thought that you and I, I mean
all of us, could share it.

35
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,125
Great, we got meat, woo-hoo!

36
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,958
Yeah! Pass the stew
and get out the bowl!

37
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,375
I love that chick.

38
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,041
Well, this totally reeks...

39
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,625
I've got no problem
with Ichijou,

40
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,291
but how'd I get stuck at a table
with the jerk who broke my arm

41
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,250
and the girl who
ruined my sneakers?!

42
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,458
Give it a rest, you pansy, you
know I didn't do it on purpose!

43
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,083
Um... you've gotta calm down,

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,458
Imadori, you'll
aggravate your injury.

45
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,041
Now then...!
Why don't we take a look

46
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,458
at what kind of ingredients
everybody brought...!

47
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,500
I brought the vegetables!

48
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,750
Just a minute, you guys!

49
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,291
You can't just throw
in stuff on your own!

50
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,375
Lara, wait!

51
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,041
They're leftover
jumbo burgers from work!

52
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,291
The fries are good too.

53
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh, no!

54
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,333
This is a real man's ingredient!

55
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,125
The king of spices,
habanero chili peppers!

56
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,208
Too spicy!

57
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,041
I brought some udon noodles.

58
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,333
I guess there's nothing
wrong with udon noodles...

59
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,750
but you can't just go tossing

60
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,375
all that stuff in
willy-nilly like that!

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,416
Yoohoo...! Can I try
a bowl of your stew?!

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,333
Wowee... it sure looks
kind of dark, doesn't it?

63
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,666
I think there's some kind of
chemical reaction taking place.

64
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,958
Oh, a top secret experiment,
huh? Lemme try some!

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,416
Yum!

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,958
Huh?!

67
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,000
Delicious!

68
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,583
Okay then, I'll give it a try.

69
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,166
Mmm, it's funny-looking,
but the flavor is really great!

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,041
Well, what the heck.

71
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,166
I'm gonna barf.

72
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,958
That stuff is even
too much for me.

73
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,666
What...? You are dumb!

74
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,083
This is the best stew ever!

75
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,041
Yeah, I really like it too!

76
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,083
Thanks you guys!

77
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,458
Let's let Lara finish
off this stewpot...

78
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,041
we'll start again
from the top...

79
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,916
I've got some veggies left.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,958
Okay.

81
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,583
I'll just be hangin'
out over here.

82
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,666
Oh... okay.

83
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,875
I'll start cutting
up the vegetables.

84
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,708
Now, while no one's looking...

85
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,875
Thanks.

86
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:06,375
It's payback time
for my sneakers!

87
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,208
They didn't notice!

88
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,125
Yakumo... can't we eat yet?

89
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,916
Because I'm starving
to death here!

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,041
Come on, Sis, didn't you eat
some of that dark stuff earlier?

91
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,208
This party is like a
delicatessen of stewpot flavors.

92
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,916
It's 'cause there's such
a wide range of ingredients.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,833
Here, Sis, all done!

94
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,291
Hooray...!

95
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,958
Hm, looks like I'm a little
late getting to the party.

96
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,625
Poor Yakumo has
been slaving over

97
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,583
that hot stew pot
this whole time!

98
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,916
Now to show her what
a gentleman I can be!

99
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,458
Here, Yakumo... have some.

100
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,333
Uh, thanks, Hanai, but
you don't have to do...

101
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,125
Come on, no need
to be shy now...

102
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,833
No, it's just that, I... uh...

103
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,125
Oh, forgive me,
is it still too hot?

104
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,500
I-I'll pass, thanks.

105
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,208
It's just about ready...

106
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,541
Now to slip some
to Lara or Tougou.

107
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,333
Darn it! How am I supposed
to get a hold of this...?

108
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,791
I'm really sorry
about your arm...

109
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,916
here, why don't you go
ahead and have the first bite.

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,875
Gracias!

111
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,875
Is this batch really that good?

112
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,416
It's the savor of friendship.

113
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,208
It tastes so bitter...

114
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,958
Is there something
the matter, Yakumo?

115
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,166
You don't have to be shy,
just open up and say, "Aah!"

116
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,375
Hanai, I can do it myself.

117
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,500
No, no, it's no
trouble, come on,

118
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,500
let me handle the stewpot now,
you've been at it all day.

119
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,958
Ah...

120
00:06:56,041 --> 00:07:00,000
Please, I'm telling you,
I don't need your help.

121
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
Hm?

122
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,041
Napoleon...? Are you hungry too?

123
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,333
That pork miso soup
is so delicious!

124
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,875
Huh?

125
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,583
Now you make sure you eat lots

126
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,541
and grow up to be a
nice big fat pig, Napoleon.

127
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,500
Yeah, there's nothing like
a nice pork miso, is there?

128
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:24,291
Oh, Harima, I had no idea you
were a fan of pork miso too!

129
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,583
I just love the stuff!
It's so rich and hearty!

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,250
There, now...
it's all nice and cool...

131
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,458
and ready for your sweet,
delicate little mouth... ahhh...

132
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,125
A pig?!

133
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,166
Oh, my!

134
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,708
Napoleon!

135
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,541
Puerco?

136
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
Mister pig!

137
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,375
Have some more...

138
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,041
I don't want it!

139
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,750
Now it's a party!

140
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,291
Napoleon!

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,625
And that was the end
of this year's stew party.

142
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,041
It was a lot of fun.

143
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,666
Make sure to invite us
back next year, Mikoto.

144
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,333
The pork miso was delicious.

145
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,750
Man, yesterday's earthquake
caught me off guard!

146
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,750
Yeah, it turned out to
be a pretty small one.

147
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,458
I know, they said it was
only a magnitude of three.

148
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,750
Aw, geez!

149
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,000
What happened to you?

150
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,375
Yesterday...

151
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,083
Yeah?

152
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,583
Okay... What?

153
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
I was...

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,291
I was deeply involved
in some personal research

155
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,000
when the earthquake hit.

156
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,458
My first reaction was to secure
my research materials,

157
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,125
which were stacked
on my shelves.

158
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,458
I didn't care about myself!

159
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,000
I had to protect my babies!

160
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,458
That was a little too close!

161
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,083
Hee-hee!

162
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm missing it!

163
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,583
One careless moment
was all it took.

164
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, at least you have
your priorities straight!

165
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,250
That's what happens when you
never throw anything away!

166
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,500
Were they really
research materials?

167
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,625
Don't question me!

168
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,916
You couldn't understand

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,833
how I feel about my
five hundred volumes!

170
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,500
Not true, I buy ten
volumes a month myself.

171
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,291
Really...? And how do you manage

172
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,625
to store all your treasures,
Miss Librarian?

173
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,208
It's a snap...!
I keep a box on hand

174
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,583
and I put all the books
I've studied inside of it!

175
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,833
Can't fit something in,
I throw it out.

176
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,875
If you like, I can come by
and help you organize.

177
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,708
No, thanks,
that's not necessary.

178
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,208
There are some things
I can't show to girls.

179
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,291
Huh?

180
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,291
Disgusting...! You stay
away from me, you pig!

181
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,750
Okay, you get a box...

182
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,416
keep only the stuff
you can fit inside it...

183
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,791
and toss out the rest.

184
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
Finally... It is done.

185
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,541
I think that turned
out pretty good... huh?

186
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, son of a--!!

187
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,500
All right... What's
the big emergency...?

188
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,041
This better be good.

189
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,333
Take your pick.

190
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,833
Huh?

191
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,041
I see... so you've decided
to get rid of them after all.

192
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,041
I gotta say, this
is quite a collection.

193
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,583
But I've got a date...

194
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,125
besides, I don't want
any of this stuff.

195
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,291
Look...

196
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,916
This video is like
from 1984, it's ancient,

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,333
it's way older than I am.

198
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,833
I'm very disappointed
in you Sergeant Imadori.

199
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,166
How could you be
so naïve? Here. Watch.

200
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,416
Gee, what do you know?
It's boring.

201
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,416
Patience...
It's coming... There!

202
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,666
Ho...!

203
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,083
One shining moment that
lit the darkness of my soul.

204
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,666
I can't throw it away.

205
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,958
I don't blame you.
My hat's off to your taste.

206
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,458
All right! Sergeant
Imadori returning to base

207
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:33,916
with relief supplies!

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,083
Just be very careful
how you handle those,

209
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,458
they are quite delicate!

210
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,291
Wasn't that Imadori...?
Nishimoto...

211
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,500
What's the big deal, yo?

212
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,583
You've just been to
the school infirmary,

213
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,000
haven't you, Corporal?

214
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,083
Ack...! How the
hell'd you know that?

215
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,666
Elementary, my dear friend...

216
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,041
Your whole body reeks
of medical disinfectant

217
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,375
and Chanel Perfume...

218
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,375
I could tell
with my eyes closed.

219
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,666
Fine... you got me...

220
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,166
I went to see Ms. Tae.

221
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,583
I have something
that's perfect for you.

222
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,125
Are there any naughty
boys out there now?

223
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,000
Uh, Doctor?

224
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,958
Oh, there is, there's a naughty
little patient right here!

225
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,083
Doctor, what are you doing?!

226
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:21,250
I'm afraid naughty boys need
to be punished very severely.

227
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,333
Dear, sweet god...
the "Infirmary of

228
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
Forbidden Secrets" series!

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,208
And get a load of her,

230
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,666
that actress looks just
like Ms. Anegasaki!

231
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,125
You... sure about this?

232
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,083
Yes... You've proven
your passion for the skin.

233
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,541
Uh... how's it goin'...?

234
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,958
You know, if these
are in your way,

235
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,958
I'd be glad to take
them all off your hands.

236
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,250
You need more
self-discipline, Trainee Nara.

237
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,208
Only three to a person.

238
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,625
I can't believe
you're just gonna

239
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,500
give me something
that's so totally amazing...!

240
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,208
Is... there some sorta catch?

241
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,750
Just take it before
I change my mind.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,708
Please share your
bounty with us as well!

243
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,875
Feel free to choose
whatever you like.

244
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,375
Sir, you're too
kind for words...!

245
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,791
I should've expected as much

246
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
from the world famous
Commander "Buddha" Nishimoto!

247
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,208
If you could spare one for me
I'd gladly sacrifice my life!

248
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,666
Don't give up
your life just yet.

249
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,083
Word on the street is you're
giving away all your treasures!

250
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,625
Think I can score a disk?

251
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,416
No way!

252
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,208
Aw... What's the problem?

253
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,375
I'm not giving one of
my children to a man

254
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,541
who has his own woman!

255
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,541
Come on, man,
don't be like that...

256
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,708
Everyone chooses their own path,

257
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,875
but if you continue
down this one...

258
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,875
A world of carnage will follow.

259
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,375
...yeah, can't wait
'til I get home...

260
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,666
...test these out tonight...

261
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,541
...ninjas...

262
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,541
It's for the best, my lovelies.

263
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,083
It's for the best.

264
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,916
Hey, I heard you were having
some sort of trouble, Nishimoto!

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,208
Is that Hanai...? I don't
remember inviting you over!

266
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,166
No need to be embarrassed...

267
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,125
I know the other guys
have already been by!

268
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,291
Right, That's because uh...

269
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,166
Come now, there's
no need to spell it out.

270
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,541
I understand they came over
to help you clean up your room.

271
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,750
As class president,
I'm obligated to help.

272
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,083
So have no fear...

273
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,916
The answer to all of
your problems is here!

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,791
Now then, let's get started!

275
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,250
Well, hello there...

276
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,166
This is... This is...! Th-th--

277
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,875
This is filth...!
I'm confiscating these!

278
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,541
No! Wait...! You can't...!

279
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,916
You can't take my
children...! Please...!

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,166
Will you let go?!

281
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,458
That guy is some piece of work!

282
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,666
He has no idea the kind

283
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,333
of damage this
could do to the class!

284
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,958
I, Haruki Hanai,

285
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,166
must find a way to dispose
of these properly... huh?

286
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,875
Whoa!

287
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,916
Oh boy!

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,541
Unbelievable!

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,416
Oh, man, that was close!

290
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I really gotta be more careful!

291
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,250
Yeah, good save, if these things

292
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,458
had scattered all
over the street then I...

293
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,375
Stare...

294
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,625
Oh, hi... there's nothing
wrong here, officer.

295
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,333
Just remember, no matter
what impurities a man carries

296
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,958
with him today,
if he does the right thing

297
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,000
he can still conquer tomorrow!

298
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,041
Hey... is that you, Hanai?

299
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,333
Wait!

300
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,750
It's not what you're thinking!

301
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,166
No, Yakumo, this is just
some trash I'm getting rid of,

302
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,958
it doesn't even belong to me!

303
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:22,958
Hey, Hanai!

304
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,500
Uh... O... Kay...

305
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,666
I wonder what his problem is...

306
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,333
And what's up with the bag?

307
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,291
Mother Superior...

308
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,541
where's Sister Adiemus?

309
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,708
She's handling the
confessional today.

310
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:40,833
And so I sent my beloved
children off to foster homes.

311
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,583
Pray... your sins
have been forgiven.

312
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,125
Thank you...

313
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,625
my children have
been saved as well.

314
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,666
Sister... I'd like you
to hear my story next.

315
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,708
Yes... of course...
please, go ahead.

316
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,541
You see, I was carrying
somewhat sinful treasures,

317
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,000
I-I mean, some sinful items,
when a girl

318
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,208
I really like saw me, and
I'm afraid I frightened her.

319
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,541
I should mention,

320
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,750
they were the property
of a very sinful friend...

321
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,041
not mine... and I was just
going to dispose of them,

322
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,708
I wasn't going to
watch them late at night

323
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,041
or anything like that,

324
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,333
so before you, God,
and baby Jesus...

325
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
I declare my innocence!

326
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,208
So... then why
did you come here?

327
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,541
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

328
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,708
Uh... just the same...

329
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,541
Perhaps you should
take this opportunity

330
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,750
to repent towards this
girl you say you like

331
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,000
so much for having
frightened her so badly.

332
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,583
Yes! That's it...! I repent.

333
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,250
God hears your prayers as well.

334
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,958
Thank you, Sister.

335
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,083
No doubt about it,
that was Hanai.

336
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,666
Excuse me, Sister.

337
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,250
Yes? Hello?

338
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,208
My name's Tanaka, and I'm in
the Yagami High Soccer Club.

339
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,625
I like this girl, Toki Nagayama,

340
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,375
who's in the same class as me...

341
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,625
but I don't have
the nerve to tell her.

342
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,750
If we win our
next game, though...

343
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,333
More love troubles, huh?

344
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,625
There's been a
lot of this lately.

345
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,541
So I swear I'll do my best!

346
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,500
Hm?!

347
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,458
Uh...

348
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,083
It wasn't a confession of sin,
but I still hope it goes well.

349
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,291
Um... Please read this.

350
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,333
Please!

351
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,125
Wait. You mean me?!

352
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,333
Yes...!

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,125
I'll wait for your answer!

354
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,291
Hey! Hold on!

355
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,041
I confess my love...

356
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,666
Are you for real, or is
this some kind of mind game?

357
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,958
Sorry about that!

358
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,875
I was just saying it
to see what it felt like.

359
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:56,833
But you do love me.

360
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,458
No, no, no!

361
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,333
You don't have to hide
your feelings, it's natural.

362
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,416
Okay, I do love you
Akira, but not that way.

363
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,583
Tell me, how did it
feel the first time

364
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,833
you told someone you loved them?

365
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,833
I make it a point not to
look back on things like that.

366
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,041
But more importantly,
why would you ask me?

367
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,083
I don't really know.

368
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,541
Interesting...

369
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,666
Are you planning on getting
a boyfriend sometime soon?

370
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,000
Or... other... friend?

371
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,666
Oh, gosh... me with a boyfriend?

372
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,333
I don't think so...!

373
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,750
It's all I can do just
to take care of myself!

374
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,458
It's just that...

375
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,958
when I'm consulted
about matters of the heart...

376
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,000
I have no idea
what advice to give.

377
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,291
I don't think you need to...

378
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,541
Ultimately it's
their own problem.

379
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,250
Yeah, Even so...

380
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,666
It's today... the match.

381
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,416
Oh, they've already started!

382
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,625
Man, I wish I knew who he was...

383
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,166
Oh well... That might be a
breach of confidentiality,

384
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,125
so it's probably
better I don't know.

385
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,250
Get around him!

386
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,500
Finally, some action!

387
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,000
That's it, go!

388
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,333
One down!

389
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,583
Tanaka!

390
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,208
Wow, that's three down!

391
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,458
There's only two left!

392
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,458
Four down!

393
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,791
Five down!

394
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,458
Do iiiiiit!!

395
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,875
Incredible!

396
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,500
So it's all over then?

397
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,333
He's the one.

398
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,833
Was she crying?

399
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,708
I'm the guy who came
in the other day...

400
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:44,250
We lost the game... I invited
her... to come watch...

401
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,000
She cheered for me like crazy...

402
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:51,416
but for some reason...
I couldn't even say thank you.

403
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,875
But still... even
though you didn't win

404
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,500
the game like you'd hoped...
you did your best...

405
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,125
Why not... tell her
how you feel anyway?

406
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,833
No... I think I've
had enough for one day.

407
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,750
But you can bet
I'll win the next game!

408
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,500
Then I'll tell her!

409
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,500
So long!

410
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,625
Wait!

411
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,208
Hold on... I, uh...

412
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,416
Good luck!!

413
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,041
Go Tanaka!!

414
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,750
I know you can do it.

415
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,291
Sister Adiemus?

416
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,625
Is that any way to
behave in the sanctuary?

417
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,541
You're awfully chipper today.

418
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,875
Something good happen to you?

419
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,666
That's private.

420
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,208
So... how're you
going to answer him?

421
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,166
Huh...?! You mean the letter?

422
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,375
That's private too.

423
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,541
This is Ryuhei Suga.

424
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,208
Talk about pathetic.

425
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,500
Wow!

426
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:34,333
Sara, I gotta say,
you're lookin' great today!

427
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,833
You really dress this place up!

428
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,375
That reminds me...

429
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,083
Asou was telling
me the other day

430
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,000
that you really bring
something special to the shop.

431
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,375
Really...?
Asou said that, about me?

432
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,458
And here it is!

433
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,916
Pickled eggplant
and rice bran ramen!

434
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,708
Uh... thanks.

435
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,791
I'm Tenma Tsukamoto!

436
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,166
With great looks,

437
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,250
a perfect figure, and brains,
I'm the campus idol!

438
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,833
Next time on School Rumble:

439
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:02,583
"Perfect, Forbidden! Entry,
Forbidden! Shorts, Forbidden!"

440
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey! Who're you?
