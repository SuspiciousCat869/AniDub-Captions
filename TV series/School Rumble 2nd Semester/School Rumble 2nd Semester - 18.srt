1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,333
Hey, Yakumo!

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm coming, Sis.

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,291
Hand-making Christmas
presents is so sweet...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,458
Do you need some help?

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,750
Heck yeah! But wear a hard hat!

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,041
Come on, what are
you mad at me for?

7
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,208
Oh, I don't know.

8
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,958
Maybe because you
didn't bother to tell me

9
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,333
that helpful employee
was actually Whiskers!

10
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,166
Hey... Gimme a break.

11
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,458
You would've never
stayed at my place

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,583
if you knew he was
staying there, too...

13
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,750
Plus it's not my fault

14
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,250
you didn't recognize
him in that outfit.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,416
If I'd... known who he was...

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I never would've spent
the night with him.

17
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,375
What?! You didn't
tell me about that...!

18
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,041
Oh, my God! How was it?

19
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,541
How was what?

20
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,541
Was it like this?

21
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,208
What?!

22
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,166
Or was it like this?

23
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,041
No!

24
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,750
You perv! Nothing happened!

25
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,833
Oh don't be shy, Eri!

26
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,625
You can tell me,
I'm your best friend!

27
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,083
So, just where did this
rendezvous occur?

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,083
Uh, well, we found...
this vacant temple...

29
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,791
And then what happened?

30
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,958
We huddled under a blanket.

31
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,416
Huddled together?

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,250
So, the two of you together
under one blanket?

33
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,250
Yeah, that's what I said.

34
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,291
 We didn't have a choice!

35
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,750
We were stranded,
it was freezing,

36
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,833
and we only had one blanket!

37
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,041
Mm-hm!

38
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,750
And so I'm supposed
to believe that you two

39
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,791
just platonically
dozed off together?

40
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,583
Neither one of
you tried anything?

41
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,791
Right...

42
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,041
So how 'bout you tell
me the truth now...?

43
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,833
I'm not gonna tell anybody...

44
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,125
I already told you!

45
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,208
Nothing happened!

46
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,333
Nothing!

47
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,833
You're serious?

48
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,083
Screw you...!

49
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you making that face?!

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,041
Akira? Yeah it's me.

51
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,041
She says she didn't
do anything with Harima.

52
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,041
Shyeah! I know, right?
Guess you win the bet.

53
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,875
Wait a minute!

54
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,333
You two are betting on me?!

55
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,666
Hold on.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,166
What about a kiss?

57
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
You know, like in the
heat of the moment?

58
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
Nope. At the rate she's going,

59
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,291
I doubt she's ever gonna reveal
her true feelings to Harima.

60
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,916
It's such a shame.

61
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,541
Why do you suck?

62
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,916
I don't suck! I don't
like the guy! Back off!

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,083
Whatever. Let's talk about work.

64
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,583
About work?

65
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,541
Mikoto and her folks have
been letting you stay here.

66
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
Don't you think it's
time to pay them back?

67
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,750
Uh... Sure. Of course.

68
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,250
Every year at this time,

69
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,666
Mikoto's parents' company
gets hired for a certain job.

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
Yeah?

71
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,166
And this year...
you're going to help.

72
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,333
I have to decorate a
giant Christmas tree, huh?

73
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,583
Should be easy enough.

74
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,958
Even if it is the
first job I've ever had.

75
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,833
Okay, people, gather 'round!

76
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,833
We're just about to get started!

77
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,666
Right.

78
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,458
But... Akira's not here yet!

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,000
Huh?!

80
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,083
What are you doing here?!

81
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,250
What about you?!

82
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,625
Um, Akira asked me--

83
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,875
Well, Mikoto asked me--

84
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,458
--to come here!

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,166
They set me up!

86
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,041
And those two call
themselves my friends!

87
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,833
After everything that
happened at the temple,

88
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,583
this is so embarrassing!

89
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,333
We're goin' to start

90
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,708
with the ornaments in
the back of the truck.

91
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,708
We'll decorate the
top of the tree first

92
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,541
and then work our way down.

93
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,166
Now if this is your
first time with us...

94
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,375
Forget Whiskers.

95
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,375
Listen to what
the foreman's saying.

96
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,708
Focus. Focus... But what
if I do have questions?

97
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,708
Does that mean...?

98
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:14,375
No! There's no way I'm
gonna ask Whiskers for help.

99
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,083
Hey, is it just me, or does that
blonde girl look like a model?

100
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,041
She does. Why is someone
like her working here?

101
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,083
I think I'll go find out.

102
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,041
Hey wait...! Here,
I can carry that for you.

103
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,083
Huh?

104
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,625
It looks pretty heavy.

105
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,041
Thanks.

106
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,125
First time doing this, huh?

107
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:55,958
Yeah.

108
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't worry. You'll do fine.

109
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,500
I'll show you the ropes, okay?

110
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,833
Cool, that's so nice of you.

111
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,333
All right, everybody!

112
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,500
Time to knock off for lunch!

113
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,416
Man, am I hungry.

114
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,583
Hey...? Can I sit here?

115
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,750
Whatev.

116
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,583
This job turned out
to be fun, huh...?

117
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,333
At first all I wanted to do

118
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,958
was tell Akira and
Mikoto to go to hell,

119
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,125
but I'm actually
enjoying myself today.

120
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:35,958
What's wrong?

121
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,500
Nah, just forget it.

122
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,375
Hey! If you've got something
to say to me, then spit it out!

123
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,916
Forget it! It's nothing!
I don't wanna talk about it!

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,416
Why?! Are you too scared!

125
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,375
Guess I'm not
really one to talk...

126
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,750
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't
have been able to say no

127
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,375
to my parents and
that arranged marriage.

128
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,333
I should be more grateful,

129
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,375
but you should've told me
who you were. Before we...

130
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,833
Before we...!

131
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,166
Hmph...! You think
I'm too scared?

132
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,625
You're really one to talk.

133
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,125
You almost didn't
tell mommy and daddy

134
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,666
that you didn't
want to get married.

135
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,625
Good thing you did. Still...

136
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,208
I'm sick and tired of
you screwin' up my life...

137
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,333
Get lost, Blondie.

138
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,750
 You really suck.

139
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,333
You know that, Whiskers?

140
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,208
Rich Girl, I know in my gut,

141
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,000
I hang out with you any
more you'll do something

142
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,166
to screw up
my chances with Tenma.

143
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,416
Eri, what's up?!

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,208
Oh, Tenma!

145
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,583
Are you working here?

146
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,708
No, I'm just meeting somebody.

147
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,125
I knew it!

148
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,916
She's like a parasite
burrowing her blonde little head

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
deeper into the
arteries of my love.

150
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,375
Wow, it's so weird
to see you working.

151
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,250
Yep... This is my first job.

152
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,750
Like it?

153
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,375
Yeah, kinda... I'm better at
it than I thought, at least.

154
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,583
Good for you.

155
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,291
You always have been
good with your hands.

156
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,125
There's only one
bad thing though...

157
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,041
Whiskers is one
of my co-workers.

158
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,208
What?! Harima?! That scumbag?!

159
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,750
Yeah. That loser.
Talk about bad luck.

160
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,750
So you don't like
him either, huh?

161
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,208
No, what is there to like?

162
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,458
He's violent...

163
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,208
He's coarse...

164
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,291
His feet stink...

165
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,916
And he's always wearing the
same clothes, like, every day.

166
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,000
What did I do to deserve this?!

167
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,583
Then he's all breathe-y

168
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,958
and lusty whenever he
ever gets near a girl...!

169
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,083
I'd watch out if
I were you, Eri.

170
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,333
Huh?

171
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,791
Tenma, I told you it was
all a misunderstanding!

172
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,958
I don't agree with
you on that one.

173
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,291
But I told you I found
him in Yakumo's room...

174
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,458
Did he do anything?

175
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,875
Did you ask him what happened?

176
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,333
Now that I think about it,
he did say something

177
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
about it all being a
big misunderstanding...

178
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,625
Harima's a jerk,
he's coarse, he's violent...

179
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,250
But the one thing he's
not is a pervert. Trust me.

180
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,916
What the--?! It can't be!

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,541
Rich Girl's actually
stickin' up for me?

182
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,208
See?! I told you!

183
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,083
Did you hear what
Rich Girl said, Tenma?

184
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,583
It was all a big
misunderstanding!

185
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,375
Word up.

186
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,791
It took you long enough!

187
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,291
Please tell Akira that
I'm not talking to her...

188
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
She knew that he
was going to be here!

189
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:24,875
He who?

190
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
Don't start!

191
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,208
I got here as quickly
as I could... Hello?

192
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,791
Anybody here?

193
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,708
That's weird...

194
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,666
I'm here. Where are you?

195
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,166
Oh... Another text
message from Akira...

196
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,000
"Good morning, Sara...

197
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:51,708
By now, you're probably inside
the old school house." Huh?

198
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,541
There's both a challenge
and a present awaiting you

199
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,375
in a classroom on
the second floor.

200
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,916
Solve one, and
you'll get the other.

201
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,291
Maybe this is it.

202
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,416
Well, here goes.

203
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,166
What the--? What is that thing?

204
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,916
I'm alive... Yes!

205
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,708
It's no use. I can't move.

206
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,083
Hello?

207
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:45,875
Huh?

208
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:46,875
Yakumo!

209
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,125
Oh my gosh, Sara.

210
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,208
What in the world are
you doing down there?

211
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:50,916
Are you okay?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
No! Stay back!

213
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,291
That's... awkward.

214
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,291
Now we're in the
same predicament.

215
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,583
The wood in this
place is old and rotten.

216
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,875
We've poked through the
ceiling of the first floor.

217
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,791
Yeah, I feel my feet dangling.

218
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,833
It's good we didn't fall
all the way through.

219
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,041
Lemme guess.

220
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,916
You came here because
of Akira's message?

221
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,375
"It's almost Christmas,

222
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
and if you'd like a
little holiday challenge,

223
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,583
come quickly to
the old schoolhouse."

224
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,125
What could that mean?

225
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,166
I don't know, but let's send
her a text message and find out.

226
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
Takano? Is that you?

227
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:39,958
Yep.

228
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,791
What are you wearing?

229
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,250
I'm paying homage to
The Emperor Penguin.

230
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,916
It can survive for two months
without eating as it waits

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,666
for its mate to return
with food from the sea.

232
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,250
Wait, let me guess.

233
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,750
You bought that
penguin costume, put in on,

234
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,083
and then you fell
through the floor.

235
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,125
Here's an idea.

236
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,625
How 'bout you
stop judging me...?

237
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,875
We need to find a way to
get out of here... A-SAP.

238
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,416
Uh... Oh! It's Tenma...!
Hey Sis, listen...

239
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,125
Hey, Yakumo, where are you?

240
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,166
I'm hungry! Feed me!

241
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,666
Well, Sis, I can't make
you lunch right now...

242
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,125
In fact, I need your help...

243
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,208
You see, I'm on the second
floor of the old schoolhouse

244
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,958
and I'm stuck here
at the moment...

245
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,250
Don't worry! I'll help you
finish what you're doing.

246
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,500
Give me a sec and I'll drop in!

247
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,250
No, Sis! Hold on!

248
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,166
Is she coming here?

249
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,375
Yes.

250
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,583
I think we all know
how that'll turn out.

251
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,541
Hey, that's mean.

252
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,166
Well, maybe she'll see
us here like this and--

253
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,958
Hey, Yakumo!
It's a penguin! Yay!

254
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,666
That plan fell through.

255
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,375
Yep, sure did...

256
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,708
You guys did it, too!

257
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,250
You should have said something!

258
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,666
Is there anyone else who
could help us...? Hey, wait!

259
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,083
Yakumo... you should
try summoning him...!

260
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,333
He'll help if he knows
you're here, definitely!

261
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,541
Summoning?

262
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,083
Wish really hard...
I'm sure he'll hear.

263
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,375
You mean, like, pray?

264
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,500
Just put your mind to it!
I know it'll work!

265
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,208
No luck, huh?

266
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,708
Well, that's strange.

267
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,625
He did say something about
getting new glasses made today.

268
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,291
Oh. That explains why Hanai
didn't come... that's too bad.

269
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,375
You were talking about Hanai?

270
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,833
Yeah. Who else?

271
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,208
Is there anyone
else we can call?

272
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,916
Let's call Eri or Mikoto!

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,333
Good luck.

274
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,375
Eri's at a party and Mikoto's
out on a date with Asou.

275
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,625
Oh, no...!

276
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,708
Well, what the heck are
we gonna do you guys...?

277
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,875
We need to come up with a plan.

278
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,750
Otherwise, we'll be
stuck here forever!

279
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,166
Wake up!

280
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,500
You can't go to sleep,
Grandma Yakumo, or you'll die!

281
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,375
Bring it.

282
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,333
I would prefer death to this.

283
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
Grandma Sara!

284
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,291
And after that...!

285
00:13:59,125 --> 00:13:59,750
That's stupid!

286
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,083
Why did you get bigger?!

287
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,583
'Cause I'm a penguin, duh!

288
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,958
Speaking of which, aren't
you guys the least bit curious

289
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,583
as to why I'm dressed like
a penguin in the first place?

290
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,541
Well, you wearing funny costumes
has sort of become the norm.

291
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,958
You should know better.

292
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,875
I've got a reason
for wearing this.

293
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,250
You, you mean you
could've gotten out

294
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,541
of that crazy
outfit at any time?!

295
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,791
Yes, that's correct.

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But I needed some way to make
you all think I was trapped...

297
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,208
And now I can take
the perfect picture...

298
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,958
For my holiday card. Smile.

299
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,583
Now that's what
I call poetic justice.

300
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,958
Son of a jerk!

301
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,041
There's no one who can help us,

302
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,083
and I'm 'onna starve to death!

303
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,000
We'll miss Christmas and New
Year's, too, if no one shows up!

304
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,125
Oh, no!

305
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,500
Don't panic.

306
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,791
We might get noticed if
someone happens to be doing

307
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,541
something in the
classroom below us.

308
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,666
Oh, come on.

309
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,708
Who would be here
during winter break?

310
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,625
Let's see... I don't know...

311
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,708
Maybe someone who has
an immoveable deadline

312
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,125
to finish one hundred and
twenty-pages of artwork.

313
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,833
However, he was
locked out of his home,

314
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,541
but was able to
stay with a classmate.

315
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
He was quickly kicked
out by said classmate

316
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,291
and then had to thwart another
classmate's arranged marriage.

317
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,333
As a result, he hasn't
gotten any work done

318
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,375
and his only refuge is
this old schoolhouse.

319
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,833
Sound like anyone we know?

320
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,791
Not even remotely.

321
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,333
Wait, you don't mean...

322
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,375
Santa Claus?!

323
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,916
What is this?

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,166
A gym mat... It broke
our fall and saved us.

325
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,625
But who was that
in the Santa suit?

326
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,750
Consider it a Christmas miracle.

327
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah that's right.
We got rescued.

328
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,291
And we still have
Christmas to look forward to.

329
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,750
And lunch.

330
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,916
Good thing I still had this
ridiculous costume on

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,333
from my new job.

332
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,208
Damn! Now I gotta find
another place to work on this!

333
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm positive I sensed
Yakumo's presence.

334
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,791
I don't know about you,

335
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,125
but I'm sick of spending
Christmas Eve alone.

336
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,916
So let's meet some chicks

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,791
and make something
happen this year!

338
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,291
That's easier said than done.

339
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,916
You're giving up
just like that?!

340
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,458
Come on, Harry! Tell us!

341
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:47,291
Please?! What are you two
wearing at the party tonight?

342
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,791
Well, well... You two
are gorgeous and curious.

343
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,833
I'm so sorry, ladies,
but that's a surprise.

344
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,291
Aw! Come on now!

345
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,250
Why do you guys always
have to tease us like that?!

346
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,166
Please tell us!

347
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,916
We don't even have a chance...

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,916
We're not nearly as
cool as those guys.

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,041
We suck at life.

350
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,125
Listen up, dumbass!

351
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,541
Are we mice or are we men...?!

352
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,875
If those guys can get chicks,

353
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,208
there's no reason
why we can't, too!

354
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,791
Well said, boy.

355
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,250
Huh?

356
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,875
Never give up.
Never stop running...

357
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,291
Death awaits those who do...

358
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:27,125
So you must keep running
furiously... furiously...

359
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,208
Furiously!

360
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,625
Recognizing your weakness
is a step towards manhood...

361
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,250
I, too, have been
down that road.

362
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,833
But are you real men yet?

363
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,666
Well... Let me be
the judge of that.

364
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,875
You must first pass the test

365
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,166
that all real men
before you have...

366
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,958
I'm having a dance party
at my house tonight.

367
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,500
Aside from the lovely ladies,

368
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,500
only those who I deem
real men may attend.

369
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,333
Huh?

370
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,875
Are you saying we can come?

371
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,333
No. Right now you
are only half men.

372
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,625
But if you prove to me you are
real men, you are welcome.

373
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,000
Wait! Hold up!
We're not even gonna try?

374
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,250
Screw him!

375
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,416
That bastard thinks
he's such a big shot!

376
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,041
Real man, my ass!

377
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,833
Excuse me, would you
like to fill out a survey?

378
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,250
Go to hell...

379
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,291
So what if we don't have
girlfriends on Christmas Eve?

380
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,000
Read your palm, sir?

381
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not like it's the end
of the world, you know?

382
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,458
The end of the world is coming.

383
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,625
Can I pray for you?

384
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,666
It can't end!

385
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,416
Not 'til I score or get
a girlfriend at least!

386
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,625
But sir, the end is nigh,

387
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,250
and your soul just
seems so parched...

388
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,875
Your face is parched!

389
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:33,958
That's it!

390
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,083
Let's become real men!

391
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,458
That's the spirit!

392
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,875
Soon, The girls
will want to do us,

393
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,458
and the guys will want to be us!

394
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,500
We'll be real men
with our own style!

395
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,583
You both copied Harry's look?!

396
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,625
What were you thinking?!

397
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,291
Well, um...
You did it too... Hello?

398
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,833
Shut up, Nara! And you.

399
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,208
You really think girls are gonna
be into the whole wig thing?

400
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,583
Damn straight.

401
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,583
Huh... So this is your lame
attempt to be real men?

402
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,750
Your face is lame.

403
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,125
Don't push it!

404
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,250
I'll give you partial
credit for your appearance.

405
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,166
However... It's not enough.

406
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,375
You have to back
it up with actions.

407
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,625
I guess that means
we gotta act cool, too...

408
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,041
You guys got any ideas?

409
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,875
Well, Harry does ride a
motorcycle, doesn't he?

410
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,500
Maybe we should
try to talk like Harry.

411
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,458
Indeed.

412
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,250
That's how you talk, dumbass.

413
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,458
I dunno, he sounded
pretty cool to me.

414
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,583
Damn straight.

415
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,625
You guys are idiots.

416
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,583
These fries are so naughty...

417
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,500
'Cause they're blocking
my view of your beautiful face.

418
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,625
Oh, you're so sweet!

419
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,208
Like Christmas candy, baby.

420
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:52,791
Whoa...

421
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,916
That's amazing!

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,625
We've gotta do that!

423
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,166
Enjoy your Big Was meal!

424
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,000
Hold it, gorgeous!

425
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,625
Can't see your beautiful face
'cause of these naughty fries!

426
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,875
And these naughty burgers!

427
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,833
And this naughty drink!

428
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,125
Give me back my lunch!

429
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,083
You know guys,
I've been thinking...

430
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,000
Maybe we're better off
just being ourselves.

431
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,291
Let's tell Tougou
to cram it. Mmkay?

432
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,291
Bravo!

433
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,833
Tougou!

434
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,125
Only real men would have the
guts to approach Lara like that.

435
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,000
As they say in her country,
you guys have cojones...!

436
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,000
The three of you are
men now! Congratulations!

437
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,750
I'll see you at my
party later, mis amigos!

438
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,708
Huh?!

439
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,000
Is this real? Are we dreaming?

440
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,916
No! It's for real!

441
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,166
We're with the cool guys...!

442
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,000
And the cool guys
always get the hot chicks!

443
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,041
Okay. I'll be right there.

444
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,458
See ya. Sorry, I have to go.
Something's suddenly come up.

445
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,458
No!

446
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,083
But without you
it's not a party!

447
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,291
Now, ladies...

448
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,250
Don't fret. Tougou's
gonna take care of ya.

449
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,500
Yes indeed... Harry may
be exiting the building...

450
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,750
But that... just leaves
more fun for the rest of us!

451
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,333
Uh...

452
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,916
What the--?

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,375
What a coincidence...

454
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,291
Everyone else had something
suddenly come up, as well.

455
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,333
Uh... Hey, you guys
tried this food yet?

456
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,875
It's pretty good.

457
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,875
Yeah. Great party, too.

458
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,875
Uh-huh. Yeah... Heh... party...

459
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,208
Yeah.

460
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,375
Hey! Don't tell me
you guys forgot?!

461
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,500
If you recall...
It's a dance party.

462
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,750
So dance!

463
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,208
Uh!

464
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,166
We... did practice...

465
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,958
Just don't step on my feet.
Okay, you guys?

466
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,791
Well, we may not...
have girlfriends...

467
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,208
but it's okay... 'Cause
I have you... and Nishimoto...

468
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,166
and you guys are the
best friends I've ever had.

469
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,083
Nara... You're such a pansy.

470

♪ ending song ♪

471

At Christmas, you
get to have curry, huh?

472
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,166
That's right, Karasuma!

473

"Here, There, and
Everywhere, Christmas!

A Dash for Christmas!
A Shattered Christmas!"

Christmas curry is the best!
