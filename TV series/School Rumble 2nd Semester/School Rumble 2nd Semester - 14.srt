1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,083
All right, attention everybody!

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,833
Does everyone have a glass?

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,375
Okay, let's hear it
for the birthday girl!

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,166
One...! Two!

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,666
Happy birthday, Tenma!

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,583
Cheers!

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,291
Cheers!

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,625
Thanks a lot, everybody!

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,541
Listen up, you guys!

10
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,416
Today, Tenma gets
to be queen all day...!

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,416
Give us your orders,
your majesty!

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,583
Oh, really...? Okay, first
up is my good friend Eri!

13
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,875
I order you to eat sticky beans!

14
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,166
No way, absolutely no way
am I gonna touch that stuff!

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,458
Now, now...

16
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,750
you shouldn't be so
picky about what you eat,

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,708
especially when it's
so good for you...

18
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,250
Here, you're going to love it!

19
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,041
Hey, you guys, what do
you think you're doing...?

20
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,041
At least let me get psyched to
eat that crap...! Wait a second!

21
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,958
Well done, my faithful subject,
we are most pleased.

22
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,625
You may step down
now if you wish.

23
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,916
I'm not going to
forget this, Tenma.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,416
Highness... who's up next?

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,291
Oh...! Let's see... how about...

26
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,500
Akira!

27
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,000
Smile.

28
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,291
Tenma...

29
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,083
Walk with me.

30
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,833
Wow! Akira, that's adorable!

31
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
What do you think she
looks when she smiles?

32
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,500
I'd like to know myself.

33
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,916
Gosh, who's next,
I guess it's Mikoto's turn!

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,958
Hey now, remember that I'm
the nice friend, okay Tenma?

35
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,666
So don't do anything too crazy.

36
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,958
I have something special
in mind for you.

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,791
I challenge you to a Pocky game!

38
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,625
I'm not playing a kissing game!

39
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,125
We'll use a grid of four boys,

40
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,041
with Akira
thrown in for spice...

41
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,750
so what number do you choose?

42
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,291
Tenma, do you ever listen
to anyone?! Dear god!!

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,791
Okay, number one.

44
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
You can't just pick for me!

45
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,333
I can't believe
I'm gonna get to see this!

46
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,291
Lame, it broke!

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,416
Too bad!

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,458
Don't ever do
that to me again...!

49
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,833
Aw, so close too.

50
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,166
If you'd gotten number two,
it would've been Asou.

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,250
Carolyn, you get to...

52
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,208
Do this! Isn't this
great! Huh? Isn't it?

53
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,875
You know you love it!

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,208
Wow, when it comes
to being a queen

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,333
and giving orders,
Tenma's a natural...!

56
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,083
I knew she would
have fun with this!

57
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,375
Uh...

58
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,333
Okay, Mikoto, let's have
you take a second turn!

59
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,541
Hey, remember how I said I
didn't ever wanna do that again?

60
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah. I was serious.

61
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,333
Um... Hey, Harima...

62
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,916
Hey...! You havin' fun?

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,333
I happened to remember
about your birthday being...

64
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,166
well, you know, about it
being the day after Tenma's...

65
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,833
So here. Happy Birthday.

66
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,625
Tenma, will you knock it off?!

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,791
Don't worry, Yakumo.

68
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,416
This guy doesn't really
need any presents.

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,208
But, Eri, I just...

70
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,666
I don't mean to intrude,

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,875
but you've celebrated plenty
already, right, Whiskers?

72
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,625
It's okay, Tenma's Sister.

73
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:48,416
Rich Girl here is right.
I've gotten plenty.

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,708
Seeing Tenma smile like
that is enough for me...

75
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,333
And I've decided...
after the party...

76
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,041
I'm gonna give her this bouquet
of flowers and tell her...

77
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:02,625
I'll finally tell
her how I feel.

78
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,208
Funny... I think
Sis is having fun...

79
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,083
But she seems... lonesome.

80
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,583
She's right.

81
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,458
It's because he's not here...

82
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,083
Hey, Tsukamoto!

83
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,750
Harima asked me to
give you a message.

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh? What is it, Suga?

85
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,250
He said he had
something for you,

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,875
and wants you to
meet him outside.

87
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,416
Whoa, Asou,
gettin' a little fresh

88
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,916
there with Suou, aren't ya?

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,125
Hi, Harima, what's up?

90
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh! Uh, hi, Tsukamoto.

91
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,958
Suga said you had
something for me.

92
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,375
Uh, yeah, you see, about that...

93
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,291
actually it was
Karasuma's idea...

94
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:59,541
He asked me to... to...
uh... deliver these to you.

95
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,333
Wow, really?

96
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,458
Idiot! Idiot! God it hurts!

97
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,333
What's this?

98
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,750
He... he said to tell you...
happy birthday.

99
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,125
Harima... the Queen
has an order for you.

100
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,958
I want you to tell
me the truth now,

101
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,583
who was it who
really wrote this note?

102
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,458
I'm sorry... it was me.

103
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,125
What the heck are you two doing
alone out here in the dark?

104
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,583
No! It's not what ya think!

105
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,666
Come on, Tenma!

106
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,250
We can't have a
party without our star!

107
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,500
Well... bye...

108
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,791
And thank you.

109
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,708
Uh... sure...

110
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,750
"Was I able to cheer
her up some?" he wondered...

111
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,958
Remembering Tenma's smile
and her words of thanks...

112
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,000
Harima gazed up
into the night sky.

113
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,375
Hello, Tazawa?

114
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,000
We desperately need an
assistant artist right away.

115
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,541
Are you free tonight?

116
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,916
Wait... you mean right now?

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,541
Yeah, we have an
artist who doesn't usually

118
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,708
use an assistant, and we're
kind of in a tight spot here.

119
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,500
Oh... yeah, okay...

120
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,500
Hell, I got nothin' else to do.

121
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,000
Terrific! I'll be waiting for
you at the office.

122
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,791
Well, that was perfect timing...

123
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,791
But I wonder who's calling me
in out of the blue like this?

124
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,583
Man, this is some party, huh?

125
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,208
It's the end of the term.

126
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,750
I think everyone was ready to
let their collective hair down.

127
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,083
Hey, that reminds me, where's
Karasuma been lately...?

128
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,375
I don't think he ever
even showed up

129
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,875
for final exams, did he?

130
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,375
He could have some trouble
passing, couldn't he...?

131
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,333
I mean, I'm not one to talk,
but I'm just sayin'...

132
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,625
I know... you're right...

133
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,000
as the official
class representative...

134
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
I've been wondering
about him as well...

135
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,875
I conferred with
Mr. Tani about it.

136
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,208
And apparently he goes
to America every month.

137
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,083
America? Why is he goin' there?

138
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,166
Who knows...?

139
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,083
Mr. Tani's never
actually asked him why.

140
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,458
It seems... he covers
for the classes he's missed

141
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,208
with make-up lessons later.

142
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,291
Karasuma has always
been kind of mysterious...

143
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,500
Maybe this has something to do

144
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,000
with that transfer
he was talking about.

145
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,750
Maybe...
But it's his business...

146
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,666
it's probably best
just to leave it alone.

147
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,250
Hey! Listen up...!
I'm gonna chug this thing!

148
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,083
Where in god's name
did you get that jug?

149
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,250
Suga! Suga! Suga! Suga!

150
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,750
Hey, Megumi.

151
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,250
Tell me...

152
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,625
What in the world do you suppose

153
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,916
Tenma sees in Karasuma anyway?

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,833
I mean, I guess he's
pretty good looking,

155
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,083
but he's kinda weird,
don't you think?

156
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,750
I'm sure he has some
hidden good points

157
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,083
that only Tenma knows about.

158
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:41,291
You know... it must be
kinda lonesome for her...

159
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,583
Not having the guy
she loves at her party.

160
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,625
♪ Oh, say can you see... ♪

00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,833
Oh... I've been
expecting you, Harima.

162
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, I'll leave you guys to it,

163
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,250
work him as hard
as you want, Nijo!

164
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,666
Ka... Ka...

165
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,291
Karasuma!

166
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,041
You heartless jerk,
how can you sit here

167
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,083
when Tenma is having
her... I'm sorry...

168
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm here to assist you
Mister Nijo, so put me to work.

169
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,583
Mmm... all right.

170
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,208
This is too weird...

171
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,875
here I am with a professional
gig, just like I wanted,

172
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,833
and I'm working for
Jo Nijo of all people!

173
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,208
This story...
it's a love comedy?

174
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,166
But I remember his comic
being a period drama...

175
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,916
Why would he change it?

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,208
And why such a weak premise to
set up one big gag...? Unless...

177
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,833
Could it be?

178
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,208
He's using his comic to
tell Tenma how he feels!

179
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,125
That sneaky bastard...!

180
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,666
I have to stop him,
whatever it takes...!

181
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,416
But how exactly can I do that?

182
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,541
Oh, crap! How could I let
ink drip onto the layout?!

183
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,958
Uh... whoops...

184
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
He laughed!

185
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,541
He definitely laughed
at me just now!

186
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,833
He's gonna pay for that!

187
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:13,250
Okay, get a grip...!
I gotta fix that layout...

188
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,375
There. A perfect recovery,
if I do say so myself.

189
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,291
Wait... it's gonna look strange

190
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,041
if he only has
sunglasses in one panel.

191
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,583
Karasuma... I mean, Mr. Nijo...

192
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,958
They're having a birthday party

193
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,583
for Tenma over at
El Cado tonight...

194
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,541
Maybe you didn't hear about it,
but everyone is already there...

195
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,541
I'm sure no one would mind if
you just, y'know, dropped in.

196
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
If you want to...

197
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
as one of her fellow
classmates, I mean.

198
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,875
Uh... sorry to intrude...

199
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,916
I just saw Tazawa leave.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,583
Is everything all right?

201
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,916
Yes.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,333
Well, okay...

203
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,250
keep up the good work,
tell me if you need anything.

204
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
Mm-hm.

205
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,583
Hmph! I'm such a candy pants...

206
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,083
showing kindness
to my enemy like that!

207
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,916
Well, guess what...
it's gonna cost him!

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,458
I'm gonna re-draw this
to make me the star!

209
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,750
Take that, Karasuma!

210
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,000
Good for you... Tenma...

211
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,125
Tsukamoto residence...

212
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,958
uh, hello, Harima... what?

213
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,583
You want me to come right away?

214
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,041
Hello, Harima...

215
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,916
sorry I'm late... what
is it you needed me for?

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,291
Hey...

217
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,125
Um... what are you doing?

218
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,541
So you spilled the ink and
decided you had no choice

219
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,375
but to escape out the window...?

220
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,833
Then you remembered
this was the 26th floor

221
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,958
and had no idea what to do next.

222
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, first off,
where are the layouts?

223
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,166
You've gotta help me,
please, Tenma's Sister!

224
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,625
Uh... do you remember the story?

225
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,000
Not a word...

226
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,666
I don't even remember the title,

227
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,958
and I can't very
well ask the editor.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There's no choice...

229
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,666
I'll have to write my own.

230
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,333
But, Harima,
how could you possibly...?

231
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,583
The cruel hand of
fate has spoken...!

232
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,000
I may not look it,

233
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,708
but under this tough guy
exterior I'm a professional...!

234
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,750
After all, I did win the New
Face Honorable Mention!

235
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,333
So you'll continue the
love comedy idea...?

236
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,083
You'll have to
get him to declare--

237
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,750
No, that's a horrible idea!

238
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,708
Uh... uh... that is...

239
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,166
I've gotta stop Karasuma's plan

240
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,000
to declare his love
dead in its tracks!

241
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,625
No, see...
if I do something similar,

242
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,708
someone will realize
it's a fake, right?

243
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,916
So instead...

244
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,791
Koshien Stadium!

245
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,708
What do you think?

246
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,958
Well, I have to admit
that it takes the plot

247
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,791
in an unexpected direction.

248
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,416
Just what I was going for!

249
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,583
O-kay, then
I guess next we'll have

250
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,291
to show him practicing
as hard as he can.

251
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,541
No way! Try to keep
up with me, baby.

252
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
At the critical moment,
he'll get mad,

253
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,125
and his strength will
increase sevenfold!

254
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,791
It happens all
the time in comics!

255
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,708
Right. Then what happens?

256
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,708
Leave it to me...!
I've got it all worked out!

257
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,541
Huh...? What's this?

258
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,500
Next there's a battle!

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
Don't worry... It's traditional
in boys' comics.

260
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,458
At Koshien Stadium they
can have a tournament!

261
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,416
It's perfect!

262
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,625
Uh...

263
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,083
It's classic, there's
always a tournament

264
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,916
when the plot gets stuck!

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,083
So then the pitcher
builds up his ki...

266
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,500
Ki?

267
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,250
Yeah, or his aura, or
whatever you want to call it.

268
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,291
We'll need to think of
some way to set that up.

269
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,791
Get this! The umpire
will be a demon king!

270
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,958
Unexpected, huh?

271
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,458
And the other team
is controlled by him,

272
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,791
and they're trying to
wipe out all life on earth!

273
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,708
Uh... why do they wanna do that?

274
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
I don't know...!
What do you think?

275
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,666
Why don't you tell me
what happens next?

276
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,625
Well, naturally
it's time for...

277
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,958
...a little romantic action.

278
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,416
It's not my strong point, but
it's bound to be very popular.

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,958
I just don't know
how to approach this.

280
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,166
You got any ideas,
Tenma's Sister?

281
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,000
Um... you could...

282
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,541
What? What is it?!

283
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,750
You could maybe
make them... kiss.

284
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,041
Wait...?! Wouldn't that
be going a little too far?

285
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,625
No...! I have to take
this story to the limit!

286
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,666
Way to go, Tenma's Sister!

287
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh... you really think so?

288
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,333
Yeah, I'll draw it up right now!

289
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,875
O-okay...

290
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,666
It's still not right.

291
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,750
Wait a minute...! I remember
a bit I saw in another comic!

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,416
The main character
stumbles and falls,

293
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,041
and somehow manages to
knock the other person down.

294
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,041
Something like this!

295
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,625
It could work! I just know it!

296
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,333
But... are you sure
you can pull it off?

297
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,041
If I act it out first to check
the composition, I'll be okay.

298
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:54,875
Huh?

299
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,875
Would you mind, um...

300
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,708
...you know, doing it with me?

301
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,666
For research!

302
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,291
Um... well...

303
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,000
I guess...

304
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,500
All right! You're on top!

305
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,708
Uh... now what?

306
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,708
I'm sure it was
something like this.

307
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,291
All right, you're up...

308
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,333
now you fall all over me, kay?

309
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,375
Okay.

310
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,708
"Ah!" First say, "Ah!"
and then you fall down.

311
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,000
If you say so.

312
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,416
Ah!

313
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,708
I love you.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,750
This still isn't right!

315
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,333
Help me out...

316
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,666
...what do you think?

317
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,750
Uh... I don't really know
much about this whole thing.

318
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,000
But can love...

319
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,541
really develop from
something like this?

320
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,875
You're right...

321
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,583
there's no way
this crap'll work.

322
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,041
I guess I should only draw
things from my own experience.

323
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,541
I was wrong to try to
borrow ideas from others.

324
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,750
Yeah...

325
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,083
All right, I'm gonna
draw something great!

326
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,250
There's no time for us
to lose, Tenma's Sister!

327
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,375
Uh... right!

328
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay, here are the betas!

329
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:10,791
Right!

330
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,666
These are the beta roughs!

331
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,833
Right! What number should I use?

332
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,041
61, please!

333
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,875
We finished it!

334
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,500
Hell yes!

335
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, boss man,
the layouts are done!

336
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,041
What's this...? What happened
to Mr. Nijo's storyline?

337
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,791
Uh...

338
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,708
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

339
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,333
Nah, don't be.
It's not your fault...

340
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,875
I'm the idiot who
spilled the ink, right?

341
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,625
It's kinda funny, though,

342
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,833
I completely forgot what
my original objective was.

343
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:37,500
Huh?

344
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,750
Which reminds me...

345
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,125
did Karasuma ever come
to your sister's party?

346
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh... Yeah... After the
party he came by our house.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,041
I see.

348
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,333
So... Harima... you know...

349
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,125
I still have that
birthday present

350
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,916
I didn't give to you before...

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,291
if you want it.

352
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,541
No...! I mean after all
you've done for me already,

353
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,750
I couldn't...

354
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,625
Take it... and Happy Birthday.

355
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,416
Thanks, Tenma's Sister.

356
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,541
What the hell... let's run it.

357
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,750
Game time, everybody!

358
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,625
All right!

359
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,333
I will accept any challenge...

360
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,375
...offered me!

361
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,416
Hey, stop it...!
Those are my lines!

362
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,916
So... what's the game?

363
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,875
Hey, listen to me
when I'm talking!

364
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,666
Well, first we select a topic...

365
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,416
And once you give your answer,

366
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,250
you pass this to
the next person.

367
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,375
When it blows up, the person
holding it plays a penalty game!

368
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,541
Blows up?!
Isn't that dangerous?!

369
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,166
It's all right
Lara, don't worry about it.

370
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,791
It sounds dangerous.

371
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,750
Oh, yeah...
whenever men play games,

372
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,125
it's no fun unless
their lives are at risk...

373
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,458
Don't you agree, partner?

374
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,625
Please stop calling me that.

375
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,625
Very well, let's begin
this competition!

376
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,416
I, Tougou
Masakazu, once feared

377
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,166
as the Tiger of Manhattan,
will take you all on!

378
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,916
Right. So anyway.

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,666
Let's get started...! When
you're handed the bomb,

380
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,458
you have to say a
famous tongue twister

381
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,958
and then pass it to
the next player... Go!

382
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,875
Peter Piper picked a
peck of pickled peppers.

383
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,208
Let's see...

384
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,500
Friendly Frank flipped
fine flapjacks, your turn.

385
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,750
Try "Rubber baby buggy bumpers".

386
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,166
No way! I could never say that.

387
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,500
Come on, Lara! You can do it!

388
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,708
Rubber baggy bubby bunkers!

389
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,875
She said it wrong...!

390
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,583
And Ichijou whispered
it to her, I call foul!

391
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,541
Lara, please, take it easy!

392
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,458
Uh, no... I was just
holding it, I wasn't playing.

393
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,291
It's penalty time!

394
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,500
Wow that's
disturbingly attractive.

395
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:17,416
Okay... on to round two, there's
lots more costumes to wear!

396
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,708
All right, I'll start
this round off.

397
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,708
Everyone name one of the
United States... California!

398
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Dakota. South side.

399
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,291
Hey, come on, hurry up,
what are you waiting for,

400
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,625
are you tryin' to stick me
with it at the last second?!

401
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,166
She wanted to wear that.

402
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,250
All right, here we go...

403
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,500
everyone name some
common flowers. Daffodil--

404
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,916
What's the big idea,
did you set me up?!

405
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,208
No, it's totally random,
don't blame me!

406
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,916
Now, now, rules are rules...

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,250
Besides, this
getup isn't so bad.

408
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,416
Right... move
that fin or lose it.

409
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,916
Tell me the truth, Suga.

410
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,750
Do you have it
in for me or what?

411
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,125
Okay, my turn...

412
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,125
the name of a person you
respect above all others...

413
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,666
Stephen Hawking,
the physicist... here!

414
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,083
Interesting...

415
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,333
Dr. Hawking,
world famous researcher

416
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,791
on black hole theory...

417
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,416
You made a very
profound choice, wow.

418
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,166
Never mind the
smooth talk, get on with it!

419
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm sorry, how rude of me.

420
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,708
The person I most respect
is... my dead father.

421
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,458
Way to make it awkward.

422
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,291
It's my turn now,
right...? Well, then...

423
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,041
The lovely Monaka Azuki.

424
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,041
Who's that?

425
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,916
The gifted star of
"Infirmary of Secrets."

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,333
You foul-minded fat pervert,

427
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,125
do you carry that thing
around with you everywhere?

428
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,625
You're absolutely disgusting!

429
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,125
When are you gonna
grow up, you pig?!

430
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,125
Those two are
pretty close, aren't they?

431
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,333
They've been arguing
since preschool!

432
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,916
Speaking of preschoolers,
where's Tenma...?

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,958
She was just here.

434
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,333
If you're looking for Tsukamoto,

435
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,916
I believe she stepped
outside for a little while.

436
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,708
I guess I better
go check on her.

437
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,625
I'll come with you.

438
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,791
Nah, it's cool.

439
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,750
It's not like she
could've gone too far.

440
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,250
This is very uncomfortable.

441
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,083
Duh! It's a penalty costume!

442
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,666
Even with that mask on,

443
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,875
our merciful Nishimoto
retains his poise...! Amazing.

444
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:18,708
What are you doing stupid?!

445
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,833
The mask is too small for him!

446
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,666
Is he breathing?!
Is he gonna be okay?

447
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,958
This way, Nishimoto!
Follow the light!

448
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,916
We're waiting for you!
Come to us!

449
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,291
We can't wait for you a
minute longer! We want you!

450
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,666
I'm coming for you,
my darlings! Here I am!

451
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,208
Wake up, perv!

452
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,458
I saw a vision of heaven.

453
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,541
Hey, Eri, what
happened to your head?!

454
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,583
Harima?

455
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,041
Are you going to Dankosha again?

456
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,250
What? Me too?

457
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,250
Next time on School Rumble
Second Semester:

458
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,666
"A Man Shut Out, A Man
Left Out, A Man Tested Out!"

459
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,583
It really is winter now, huh?
