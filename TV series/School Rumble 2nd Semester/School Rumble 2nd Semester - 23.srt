1
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:17,458
I said that... I didn't
wanna see you again...

2
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,666
'Cause... We've
never gotten along...

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,541
But... I need... your help.

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,375
Maybe things'll be
different this time.

5
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,000
Maybe we'll have a
happier relationship...

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,583
Oh, who am I fooling?!

7
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,875
I've gained weight again!

8
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,166
Why am I always such a
fatso after New Year's...?

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,250
What's Karasuma gonna say
if he sees me like this?

10
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,625
You're too fat.

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,375
You're right,
I am fat! That's it!

12
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going on a strict low-cal,
low-carb diet as of this moment!

13
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,666
If I had known, I wouldn't have

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,458
made these rice
cake pizzas for lunch.

15
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,541
I'll just go make something
healthier for you, okay?

16
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,958
Don't bother!

17
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,000
Um, hello...?
Hey, Mikoto...! What?

18
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,375
A ski trip?! Hell's to
the yeah, sista! I'm down!

19
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,083
Wow, that sure was short notice.

20
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,750
Yep... Someone got sick
and couldn't make it,

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,000
so that opened up
a spot. Lucky me.

22
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
Well, you said you
wanted to exercise...

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,916
So this is perfect.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,625
Yep! I'm gonna
burn up the slopes

25
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,500
while I burn off the calories!

26
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,791
Bye! See ya, Sis!

27
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,791
Have fun now and be careful.

28
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,041
Don't you worry.

29
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,333
I'll be fine.
I just need to warm up.

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,166
Thank you. Come again.

31
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,291
All right! Got my screentones!

32
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,125
But, man, were they pricy!

33
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,541
I gotta have 'em, though,

34
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,875
if I'm gonna pull off this
assignment Gotou gave me.

35
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,458
I'll give you thirty pages
in the annual spring special.

36
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,791
Draw me something with drive!

37
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,208
With spirit! With passion!

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,291
Yeah! I'll draw it, all right!

39
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,000
You'll draw what? 

40
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,166
Draw?! I'm not drawing,
your face is drawing, shut up!

41
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,333
Sorry... Kinda freaked
out a little there.

42
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,625
Yeah... I noticed.

43
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,916
Let's see if we can
make it happen again.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,458
Huh?

45
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,208
Some friends and I are leaving
for a ski trip later today.

46
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,541
So, what's it to me?

47
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,375
Tenma's going.

48
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,291
Good one.

49
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,333
Tenma skiing?

50
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,458
And bundled up like an Eskimo?

51
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,625
She'll be the cutest
little snow bunny ever!

52
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,833
Oh, man, I'd love to see that!

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,875
I wanna go, too! Crap! I can't!

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,958
I got a deadline
to meet, and besides,

55
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,916
I don't have the money
to go. Damn it all...!

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,375
Guess I'll have to
bide my time here away

57
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,416
from my little arctic fox.

58
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,416
I hope you ladies
have a good time.

59
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,083
Interesting.

60
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,708
Hey, Itoko. I'm home.

61
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,166
Gone on a trip to
Okinawa with Youko.

62
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
Back in three days. Take care.

63
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,375
I can't wait to have
some Soki-soba noodles.

64
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,916
Hang in there, Kenji.

65
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,291
You gotta be kidding me!

66
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,416
So you took off and
locked me out again, huh?!

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,041
Well, I'm not as dumb as I look.

68
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,250
I had a feeling you'd
pull this crap on me again,

69
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,833
so I took the liberty of
getting a key made.

70
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,125
Checkmate, Itoko!

71
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,458
For you to be reading this,

72
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,916
you must have secretly
made a duplicate key.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,541
When I get back,
I'm going to get you for this.

74
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,375
And here she is.

75
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,708
Figure skating's star of
the moment, Fukuda Kyoko,

76
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,375
with her first-ranked
short program.

77
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
What a surprise!

78
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,666
She's already launched

79
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,458
into an incredibly
steady Biellmann Spin!

80
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,500
Look at that form!
She's not shaking at all!

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,333
Look at her go!

82
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,208
The crowd is going absolutely
wild with excitement!

83
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,708
She's still spinning!

84
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,125
How long can she keep this up?!

85
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,708
Maybe I should try that...

86
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,000
What a performance!

87
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,375
I will! I'll do it!

88
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,583
I'm going to learn
the art of ice skating!

89
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,791
The ice may be chilly,

90
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,958
but the audience
reception is anything but.

91
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:42,458
What do I do?!
What do I do...?! Ichijo!

92
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,375
Yeah!

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,333
Woo-hoo.

94
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,208
Oh, man! I just love the feel
of fresh snow in the morning!

95
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,958
Yeah, me, too!

96
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,541
It feels even better
when your whole body's in it.

97
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,458
Yeah... I'll pass.

98
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,291
Hey... Guys, where's Tenma?

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,666
Yippee!

100
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,875
That was so fun!

101
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,541
Hey, what are you
guys looking at?

102
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,750
You're incredible... OMG!

103
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,208
Ya think...?
Hey, maybe I could even teach

104
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,541
Yakumo a thing or
two about skiing.

105
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,708
I'm no good at this!
Please help me!

106
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm sorry you're such
a klutz, Yakumo.

107
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,250
Guess what they say about people
having hidden talents is true...

108
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,375
Check it... What do
you think of my talent?

109
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,375
Uh... I don't know
what do you mean Akira?

110
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,208
You wouldn't understand.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
That was awesome!

112
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,541
That jump totally kicked ass!

113
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,458
And we should know!

114
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,291
We're on the ski
team at Otowa U!

115
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,791
College boys!

116
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,041
Oh cool, a heart!

117
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,750
I gotta admit, he's good...

118
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,041
So, ladies...?

119
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,791
Want some close, personal
instruction...? What the--?

120
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,416
I don't think
they're into us, dude!

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Hey!

122
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,250
Come on! We were
just getting started!

123
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,583
Come back!

124
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,250
I guess they were kinda fun...

125
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,916
But we could so do better.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,250
You can't deny they knew
how to rock those ski jumps.

127
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,250
They'll be back.

128
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,250
Let's play hard-to-get.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,875
Tenma, how scandalous.
I love it!

130
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,166
Better watch it...

131
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,083
Karasuma finds out,
you'll be in big trouble.

132
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,791
Oh, he won't know
about it! He's not here!

133
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,500
Except I'm right here.

134
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,875
He's here!!!

135
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,500
Whoa, Karasuma?

136
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,166
Dig the suit, man.
But why are you here?

137
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, it's a long story.

138
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,375
Good to see all of you.

139
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,500
Hold up... Are you
challenging me or something...?

140
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,541
I'm the mascot here.
Get your own turf!

141
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,416
You're acting crazy again...

142
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,916
K... Karasuma...?

143
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm sure he heard what I said!

144
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,375
He'll think I'm a tramp!

145
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,000
Geez, Tenma...
Then why did you say it?

146
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,250
I don't know!

147
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,125
Everyone was telling me
how great I could ski

148
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,291
and I got cocky!

149
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay. Stop crying...

150
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,166
I'll help you smooth everything
over with him, all right?

151
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,000
You really mean it?

152
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,708
All right, this is
what we're gonna do:

153
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,583
we're all gonna jump
at the same time

154
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,916
and spell out
"I love you" to Karasuma.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,833
Tenma goes first,
then me, then Mikoto.

156
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,833
Do you think we're
that coordinated?

157
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,041
Last I checked we weren't
professional skiiers.

158
00:09:59,125 --> 00:09:59,833
Just sayin'.

159
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,125
Don't be so scared.

160
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,166
It's just like that
jump Tenma made earlier...

161
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,708
Let's go! There's Karasuma!

162
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,208
No backing out now!
It's do-or-die time!

163
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,083
Ready... Go!

164
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,416
Karasuma... This... is!

165
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,666
This is how I feel about you!

166
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,375
Futo-sugi.

167
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,375
That means...
"You're too fat" in Japanese.

168
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,958
No, hold on! We got
the kanji all wrong!

169
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,166
No, it's okay...

170
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,291
I ate too much over New Year's.

171
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,750
I need to lose some of it.

172
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,541
Now let me show you how
I feel about your message.

173
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,291
Karasuma, wait!

174
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,083
Bye.

175
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,916
He's so magnificient...

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,583
I'm getting cold.

177
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,708
Wanna head back?

178
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,000
Mm-hm.

179
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,458
Good! All of you made it.

180
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,166
Ice skating, huh...?

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,083
I'm a little surprised you
wanna learn how to do it.

182
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,583
Hmph.

183
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,583
Still, there's no way we'd
miss your big debut on the ice.

184
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,750
Yeah...

185
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,333
You know... it's
my first time, too.

186
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,583
And it gives me a chance
to get close to Imadori...

187
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,250
Thanks, Lara.

188
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,125
You know... All this
ice brings me back...

189
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,250
It reminds me of the
frozen tundra I saw

190
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,875
when I lived in Alaska.

191
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,375
So tell me... Do I look pretty?

192
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,625
Lara, you might wanna go change!

193
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,458
Is it that bad?

194
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,416
No human should ever
take part in this sport!

195
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,458
Uh... Oh gosh...

196
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,666
Just don't let go
of me, okay, Harry?

197
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,791
Don't worry.
Just relax a little.

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,250
Easy...

199
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,916
Hang in there, Satsuki!
You'll get it eventually!

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,375
I hope so! Look at you,
you're just like a pro!

201
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,291
Stop, you're embarrassing me!

202
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,333
Hey, something wrong, Lara?

203
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,708
Don't tell me you can't skate.

204
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,625
Is it too hard for
a gorilla like you?

205
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,791
Oye! Imadori...! Teach me how
to skate and I won't kill you!

206
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,125
No problem, baby,

207
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,250
but only if you skate
over to me first, 'kay...

208
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,041
Come on, gorilla girl...

209
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,708
Why you...!

210
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,166
Ice is your weakness, huh?

211
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,875
People say revenge is
a dish best served cold...

212
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,875
All that skating made me hungry!

213
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,041
Hey, you did really well out
there for your first time.

214
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,083
I just wish I could
be as good as you.

215
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,458
I never knew you were such
an accomplished skater.

216
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,041
But I'm not.

217
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,875
I just take Kosuke here a lot
so I get in a lot of practice.

218
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,750
You could have fooled me.

219
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,083
You were the best one out there.

220
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,708
I don't get it.

221
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,416
I usually dominate
any sport I take part in,

222
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,041
but this ice skating...

223
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,416
Hey, guys, did you
get one of these?

224
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,708
The Yagami Cup Figure Skating
Pairs Tournament...? Hey...

225
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,125
Guys, It's actually
being held here today.

226
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,750
Check out the First Prize.

227
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,125
Oh, wow!

228
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,750
What...? "Today's
fabulous First Prize is

229
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,916
a brand new
washer and dryer?"...

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,333
I have to enter
this contest right now!

231
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,500
Karen?

232
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,291
Sorry, I got excited...

233
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,750
I need that wa--I mean,
it sounds fun!

234
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,791
Hmph...

235
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,750
We're always rivals,
aren't we...?

236
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,000
We'll compete
against each other!

237
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you nuts?

238
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
You don't even
know how to skate.

239
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,250
But then again,
there is one surefire way

240
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,250
for you to win this thing and
that's under my firm tutelage

241
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,083
Are you serious?!

242
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,666
Karen, I'm dirty!

243
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,041
Karen, my gym
clothes aren't clean!

244
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,541
Karen, I've got a stain!

245
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,750
Karen!

246
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,875
Karen!

247
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,291
With a washer and dryer,
I'd be a cleaning machine!

248
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,541
I've gotta hit a
homerun on this one!

249
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,125
Welcome to the Yagami Cup
Figure Skating Pairs Tournament.

250
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,291
Mr. Kobayashi and I will
be your commentators.

251
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,291
All pairs to the rink, please.

252
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,458
Hey? Imadori...

253
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you sure your
plan is going to work?

254
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,833
Yeah, don't worry
about it, babe.

255
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,833
I have to try my best to win...

256
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,125
for the family!

257
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,708
Ah, yes. You and I are
going to fire this place up.

258
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,375
Sure you don't want to compete?

259
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,125
It's still not
too late to enter.

260
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,916
Oh, thank you, Harry...
But I can't skate!

261
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,916
I hope you're ready
for the embarrassment

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,083
of your life, Queen Kong!

263
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,375
First up is the pair
of Ichijo and Tougou.

264
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,375
Both are students
who attend Yagami High.

265
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,875
Ichijo appears to be at home on
the ice, doesn't she...? Oh?

266
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,833
Hold on, is that a...
Mr. Kobayashi?

267
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,750
Kosuke, I did it!

268
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,333
Yes! Tougou's doing a
rarely-witnessed Alaska Spin!

269
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,791
An impressive move on the part

270
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,416
of Tougou, but it's
against the rules...

271
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,375
He's doing it alone.

272
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,875
You're right.

273
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,250
He's not including his partner,
Ichijo, into his routine.

274
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,541
I think he forgot this
is a "pairs" competition.

275
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,083
Hey, what are you doing?

276
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,583
Unfortunately, we're going to
have to disqualify this pair.

277
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,500
Sorry.

278
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,541
Hmph. You judges
don't appreciate

279
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,791
my rugged individualism, do you?

280
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,875
Kosuke, I'm sorry
I let you down.

281
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,875
Next up is the pair
of Lara and Imadori.

282
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,791
I understand that
Lara hails from Mexico.

283
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,791
It'll be interesting to
see how she fares on the ice.

284
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,458
I'll show you!
I'll show all of you!

285
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,125
There is not a sport
I cannot master!

286
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,583
Looks like we're up.
Let's go do it, Lara...

287
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,333
Let's make an impression
they'll never forget!

288
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,958
Yeah!

289
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,625
Lara...! That's a
speed skating outfit!

290
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,958
That's a mistake only
a novice would make.

291
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,083
Imadori, you tricked me!

292
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,083
There's nothing you can
do about it on the ice,

293
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,125
though, ya big dummy!

294
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,458
Why you!

295
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:14,000
Ima--I will kill you!
You are dead meat!

296
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,708
Aw, did that hurt?
It sure looked like it.

297
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,791
Uh...

298
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,125
In an amazing twist,
Lara has gone barefoot...

299
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,625
And it appears she's pursuing
her partner across the ice!

300
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,083
Now a perfect finishing move...

301
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
Yeah, maybe if this was
pro wrestling... am I right?

302
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,125
Bravo! Bravo! Working a
luchadore move like that

303
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,625
into your routine is
a stroke of pure genius!

304
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,125
Do you think we should...?

305
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,958
Leave? Yes.

306
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,916
Huh...?! What in
the hell?! Aw, dammit!

307
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,750
Don't tell me I fell asleep!

308
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,458
Wait...! How did I get
away from the kotatsu?!

309
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,375
Great! I'm already
catching a cold!

310
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,541
Huh?

311
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
Wait, what's goin' on?

312
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,333
It feels like there's
somethin' in there!

313
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,791
But what?!

314
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,333
I... I'm dreaming!

315
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,541
That's the only explanation!

316
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
I mean, it's
physically impossible

317
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,041
for a giraffe to fit under a
table that size, right...? Oh!

318
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,833
Man, this is a vivid dream!

319
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,458
Feels like I'm being touched,
but come on, get real.

320
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,041
He's like sixteen feet tall.

321
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,250
There's no way he'd
even fit, no way at all...

322
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,500
A giraffe? In here?
That's crazy talk!!

323
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,416
Pyo-Py-Pyo... Pyotr!
Holy crap! It is you!

324
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,208
You were under the Japanese
style table with a heating unit

325
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,208
under it, which I earlier
referred to as a kotatsu?

326
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,583
She needs help.
Please, my dear friend.

327
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,958
She needs you.

328
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,708
What? Who needs me?

329
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,250
Tenma, in danger...!

330
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,000
Your keen, animal senses
detected it, didn't they?!

331
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,250
Help please.

332
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,833
Argh! What is it?!

333
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,083
Is she trapped under an
avalanche... cold and alone?

334
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,916
Or is some grabby little pervert
chasing her...?! Who cares?!

335
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,750
I gotta move...! Onward beast!

336
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,250
Never fear, sweet lady!

337
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,833
We ride for your salvation!

338
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,833
Hi, Sis...

339
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,500
Yakumo, are you still sick?

340
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,916
Uh-huh.

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,541
Here. I made this for you.

342
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,000
A bunny?

343
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,583
Sorta.

344
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,000
Thank you so much, Sis...

345
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,208
It feels so nice and cool.

346
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,666
Really...? I'm so glad!

347
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,083
You're the best.

348
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,708
Tenma's sister!

349
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,666
Hey, you're not
looking so good...

350
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,416
You feel like...
You're burning up!

351
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,208
I better put you to bed, quick!

352
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,708
A little bed rest should
do you some good.

353
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,125
And here I was thinkin'
your sister was in trouble.

354
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,291
I hope you feel better...
Well, I have to go.

355
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,166
Got a deadline to meet.
Another comic.

356
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,416
The spring special...

357
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,416
Iori...

358
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,750
Thanks you so much.

359
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,083
It feels so nice and cool.

360
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,583
Thank you.

361
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:29,583
♪ ending song ♪

362
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,791
A cruise to the
south islands, huh?

363
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,750
Yeah, sure, I'll go with ya...!

364

Next time, on School Rumble:

"Southern Rainbow 2-C!

Ya'akumo of the Mysterious
Island! The Seven Seas!"

Oh, yeah, that Four-Eyed bastard
is still on that kite, huh?
