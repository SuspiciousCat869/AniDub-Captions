1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,083
Whenever you watch television,

2
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,791
you should always
keep the lights on

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,833
and watch from a safe distance.

4
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,291
What's the matter, gentlemen...?

5
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,791
You appear to be a bit confused.

6
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,458
Very well... as a reward,
I'll explain myself to you.

7
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,041
I was on the
outer wall of the school.

8
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,208
I grabbed onto the window
frame and hid myself outside...

9
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,666
a good soldier should always
know the lay of the land...

10
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,916
I trust this has
been educational.

11
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,208
So you're some kind of
cross-dressing soldier?

12
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,666
I think not...

13
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,875
I am merely a humble
butler who was passing by.

14
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,041
Sadly, now that you
have seen me like this...

15
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,416
you must disappear.

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,958
I know I've got to be
missing something here,

17
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,625
but I'm guessing this means
he's working for the Play Team.

18
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,208
If that's true...
doesn't matter who he is.

19
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,416
Let me give you boys a
little piece of advice...

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Some times when
fighting indoors,

21
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,500
sidearms can be
very effective...

22
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,166
By not carrying one...
you've lost.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,875
Hasta la vista.

24
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,750
Sniper...! Somewhere outside!

25
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,833
Tch!

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,541
I'm not sure what happened,
but did we just luck out?

27
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,083
I guess he just let us go...

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,708
Or more likely... decided we
weren't worth worrying about.

29
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,708
Okay, so, you got any idea

30
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,375
what the heck was
up with that dress?

31
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,666
I don't know, and believe
me I don't wanna know.

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,833
Where'd he go?

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,208
She's deliberately
exposing her position.

34
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,916
Is she trying to distract me?

35
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,291
So beautiful...

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,791
A flower blooming
on the battlefield.

37
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,000
So out of respect
for your beauty...

38
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,416
We've already lost so many...

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,291
Do you have enough
bullets to go on?

40
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,208
I don't know. I just
used up my last clip.

41
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,208
Then it's over...

42
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,208
Looks like...

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,166
You know...

44
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,250
if we manage to get out
of this mess in one piece...

45
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,458
How about a date?

46
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,208
Sure.

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,208
I wonder if I'm the only
one who managed to survive?

48
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,166
Oh my god! This is
the whole Play team!

49
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,958
Doesn't make sense.

50
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,125
If they're down... who
have we been fighting...?

51
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,041
And are they still out there?

52
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,750
There's no escape
for you now... Miss Suou.

53
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,166
Impressive...
You still remain calm.

54
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,750
Come out!

55
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,458
Coward! Face me!

56
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,458
Leaving you for last was
definitely the right call...

57
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,875
You're really
dangerous, aren't you?

58
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,125
I know you...

59
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,666
You're Tsumugi Yuki...
but why are you here?

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,041
I thought you had band practice.

61
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,958
We got permission from Akira.

62
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,625
There's nothing in
the rules against it.

63
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,750
It's time for you to say
good-bye... Miss Suou.

64
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,541
Are you injured
in any way, Mikoto?

65
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,875
No... But, man, am
I glad to see you!

66
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,125
Hanai.

67
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,791
So it's Yuki, huh?

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,958
I never expected...

69
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,041
Not so fast... Yoshidayama!

70
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,375
There is no way I'm
doing cleanup detail...!

71
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,833
Get outta my way!

72
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,916
Are you okay?

73
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,583
We better clean this
glass up to make sure

74
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,458
no one sustains an injury.

75
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,625
Oh... okay.

76
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,500
Wow, what's with this guy...?

77
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,625
Is he like, obsessive
compulsive or something...?

78
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,750
I mean, this is
the 21st century,

79
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,333
but he's treating me
like a damsel in distress.

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,583
You can't ride
without your glasses...

81
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,666
Come... I, Haruki Hanai,
will escort you home!

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,666
No, it's okay!

83
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,083
I'm sorry madam,
but it is my duty.

84
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,666
But before we embark,
how much do you weigh exactly?

85
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,750
Well, there goes the whole
knight in shining armor image.

86
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,958
I'm sorry to be such a bother.

87
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,791
Not at all.
Don't worry about it.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,375
These hills are pretty steep...

89
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,291
Isn't the ride to school hard?

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,208
Well, it's a bit far...

91
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,791
but I don't like buses...

92
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
Besides, I enjoy the view...

93
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,125
You get a good feel for
the seasons this way...

94
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,833
I like the view from the
top of this hill best of all.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,125
Mmm, it's no use...

96
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,833
I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

97
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,125
Do you... have a moment?

98
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,333
Huh?

99
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,083
You see this view
every day, don't you...?

100
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,375
You should see it today too.

101
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,916
What? No, you really
don't have to stop.

102
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,875
I'm telling you, it's no use.

103
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,125
I'm blind as a bat
without my glasses.

104
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,291
Don't worry.

105
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,041
Believe me, you're
going to wanna see this.

106
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,250
There...
It's beautiful isn't it?

107
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,500
It's amazing.

108
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,291
Now aren't you glad that
I talked you into stopping?

109
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,708
This guy... I just
don't get him...

110
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,166
Well, it's two against one.

111
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,375
One of you will get me,
so go ahead and shoot.

112
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,000
But just know,
it doesn't matter,

113
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,750
because you guys
are gonna lose anyway.

114
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,291
Wait... what do you mean?

115
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,125
The Band Team is already on
its way to take your flags...

116
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:29,083
Karasuma, Fuyuki...
Ichijou... and Sagano...

117
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,875
If you want to stop them,
you'll have to go through me.

118
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,541
No, I can't do it...!

119
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,000
You weren't supposed to
be our enemy, not the band!

120
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,458
Then you're a coward!

121
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,958
No, Tsumugi!

122
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,458
Don't fall apart
on me, Hanai...!

123
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,708
Please, just stay strong!

124
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,875
We've got to tell the others!

125
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,625
Let's go.

126
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm sorry, Yuki.

127
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,333
What...? The Band Team?

128
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, and we have to stop them

129
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,416
before they can take our flag!

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,291
No sweat, we have
nothing to worry about.

131
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,041
We still have the upper hand
when it comes to military force!

132
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,625
What happened?!

133
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,625
Is this the work
of the Band Team?

134
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,208
This is terrible.

135
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,291
Ishiyama?!

136
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,000
Alright, you made it!

137
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,541
What... what was that
sound...? Asou...? Suga!

138
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,666
Please come in!

139
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,041
Do you read me...?! Guys?

140
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,708
It can't be...

141
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,333
Don't you fall apart on me now.

142
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,041
I won't. Let's kick some ass.

143
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,916
Targets sighted.
Hanai and Mikoto.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,791
Now let's pen them in,
just like we planned.

145
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,250
Cool, copy that.

146
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,958
I guess nobody's coming.

147
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,541
Sh! Be quiet!

148
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,291
Remember we're the
last line of defense

149
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,291
against any enemy who
tries to get near the flag!

150
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,708
I'll be back in
just a minute, Tenma.

151
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,958
Huh...? Wait...

152
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,750
Wait a minute,
where are you going...

153
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,250
Don't leave me alone!

154
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,791
I think someone
might be out there...

155
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,916
I'm gonna go check
it out... Sit tight...

156
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,875
What just happened?

157
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,916
Eri...? You okay...?

158
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,458
Eri?

159
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,333
Don't move!

160
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,291
Hello, Miss Tsukamoto,

161
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,708
the moon sure is
lovely tonight, isn't it?

162
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,000
It's strange, you know, I
managed to make it all this way,

163
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,208
but at the very end,

164
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,416
I guess I slipped up
and dropped my guard.

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,750
What is this...?

166
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,708
Why are you here,
Karasuma, and not at practice?

167
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,458
It's over, now give it up.

168
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,291
I can't shoot without
hitting Megumi!

169
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,250
And poor Megumi
can't hit me this close.

170
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,666
Maybe, but the same
thing goes for you, duh!

171
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,083
Mikoto!

172
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,750
I'm really sorry
about this, Ichijou.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,500
Well... it looks like we're
both safe for the moment, Hanai.

174
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,583
Harima!

175
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,291
No bullets!

176
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,708
Finish it.

177
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,083
I'm afraid I can't do that.

178
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,000
It's not quite the right moment.

179
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:12,375
No, don't...! Harimaaaa!

180
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,708
You're too late, four eyes.

181
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,583
Mikoto!!

182
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,041
I wonder if it's all over yet...

183
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,541
whether Hanai's group or
Harima'a group survived...

184
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,208
we're not the ones
who were meant to win.

185
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,666
Then... why did you
shoot Eri, Karasuma?

186
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,083
I was desperate...

187
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,000
But I guess that's
no excuse, is it?

188
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,125
I'm sorry...

189
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,583
Since we missed
out on the drawing

190
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,041
and couldn't appear on the
culture festival main stage,

191
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,416
our only other option was
to enter the survival game

192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,125
and win so we could
play inside the classroom.

193
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,791
I guess that was
pretty selfish of us

194
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,958
when you come right down to it.

195
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,208
But we practiced so hard,

196
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,916
we couldn't give up
without doing something.

197
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,958
You guys really have
worked hard, haven't you...?

198
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:12,833
Tsumugi and Carolyn and
Fuyuki and... especially you.

199
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,833
Give us a good
performance, okay?

200
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,000
No, why did you stop me?

201
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,541
Thank you Miss Tsukamoto...

202
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,208
but... I think I should
be the one to concede.

203
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,375
Looks like it's just you
and me now, isn't it?

204
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,875
You bastard...! How dare you
treat Mikoto like that...?

205
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,083
I will never... never
forgive you for that, Harima!!

206
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't want your forgiveness...

207
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,083
Just shut-up and fight!

208
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,875
This battle will
decide everything!

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,166
Damn it...

210
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,041
I think Harima's still
got plenty of ammo...

211
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,625
But I'm almost out...

212
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,083
Alright... Where are you?

213
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,250
There's no way you've
already given up...

214
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,708
You stealthy bastard!

215
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,208
Coward!

216
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,791
Get out here!

217
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,916
Don't you know there's no use
in hiding from death himself!

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,458
It won't do any good
to challenge me, Harima...

219
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,500
I just want to
ask you one thing...

220
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,333
and I want an honest answer...

221
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,666
Just give it to
me straight, alright,

222
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,458
are you really in
love with Yakumo?

223
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,833
Huh?

224
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,958
I've heard some
things about you two...

225
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,500
and I want to know...

226
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,250
I need to know...
do you truly love her?

227
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,875
That's... all I ask.

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,666
What kind of idiot are you...?

229
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,166
Why should I have to
answer that question at all...?

230
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,708
If you want to know,
then ask me by force!

231
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,833
So it's a quick draw, then!

232
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,375
Y'know, I was hoping
you'd say something like that.

233
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
All right, Harima,
you asked for it,

234
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,166
I'll get your answer
out of you by force.

235
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,666
Heh, right, sure you will,
four-eyes, just make sure

236
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,833
you haven't disappeared
when I turn back around.

237
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,000
One... two...

238
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,958
Three... four...

239
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:50,000
Five... six... seven... eight...

240
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,416
Nine...

241
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,625
Ten!

242
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,208
I was almost out of ammo.
Why'd you do it?

243
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,833
If we'd kept on fighting like
before you would've won...

244
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,375
It's because I truly understand

245
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,833
how much you're
in love with her...

246
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,750
As someone who
hasn't confessed his love...

247
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,750
I know how much it can hurt.

248
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
Wait, are you telling me
it's not Yakumo

249
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,791
you're in love with
but someone else...?

250
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,416
Tell me... who is it?

251
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,833
That's kind of a
personal question, isn't it?

252
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,833
Harimaaaaaaaa!!!

253
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,666
Have to admit, you made
a pretty good movie.

254
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,375
Everyone was a lot more intense
than I thought they'd be...

255
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,375
Starting about halfway through,
it was mostly adlibbed.

256
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,833
I wish those two could keep on
like this instead of fighting.

257
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,791
Oh well, at least this
gave them a chance

258
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,500
to blow off some of their
hostility toward each other.

259
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,375
In all my years teaching,
this is a new one,

260
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,250
students conducting
war games on campus

261
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,750
in the middle of the night!

262
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,166
Now, now, then...

263
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,458
I'm sure they're all very
sorry for the whole thing,

264
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,708
why don't you give them a break?

265
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,041
Do you hear that...!

266
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,375
You people are lucky that
Ms. Osakabe found you...

267
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,458
I'm gonna give you a break
for her sake, so be thankful!

268
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,666
However...

269
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,000
This whole thing was
caused by your argument

270
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,125
over your culture
festival event, right...?

271
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,791
So stop arguing and do
the play and the cafe...!

272
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,791
Got me?

273
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,041
Huh?!

274
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,625
You gotta believe me!

275
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,166
This... old guy with a mustache
was dressed like Sawachika!

276
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,458
Ah, you were seeing things,

277
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,750
Sawachika was over on guard

278
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,708
at the Play
Team's flag all night.

279
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey, Eri, you saw him,
right, that mustached pervert?

280
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,083
Can't say I did.

281
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,750
So what the heck are we supposed
to do for the culture festival?

282
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,541
Do we have time to do both
the play and the coffee shop?

283
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,958
No way is there time to do both.

284
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,666
Not to worry!

285
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,125
I, Haruki Hanai, will
take care of everything...!

286
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,833
I'll negotiate at once with the
culture festival committee...

287
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,250
so we can find a way to do both
the play and the coffee shop!

288
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,500
I don't know if it's possible,

289
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,666
but I say we move forward

290
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,500
with both the
coffee shop and the play!

291
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,375
And the band.

292
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,708
Wow! Hanai sure knows
how to take charge!

293
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,208
Hanai, you bastard!

294
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,958
How dare you get
Tenma's attention?

295
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,916
Mikoto!

296
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh snap! I totally heard that!

297
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,166
Are you kidding,
the whole school heard it!

298
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,958
Mikoto... heh!

299
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,500
It's not like that!

300
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,666
Pretty quick with
the denial, Mikoto!

301
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,291
What is the matter
with you people?!

302
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,208
Come on you two!

303
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,791
You know you love each other!

304
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,416
Hey...! shut uuuuuuup!!

305
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,041
Oh, uh, Karasuma!

306
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,958
What a coincidence...

307
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,916
you want to walk home together?

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
Sure.

309
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,250
The culture festival
is almost here, huh?

310
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,250
Uh-huh.

311
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,416
I'm really looking
forward to it...

312
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,416
You know...

313
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,041
I've never seen
you get all exited

314
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,083
over something
like that before.

315
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,625
I really am excited
on the inside...

316
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,875
but I guess it just doesn't
show on the outside.

317
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,625
Well, why don't you just
shout, "I'm having fun"?

318
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,541
Mm... I guess I could.

319
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,166
Oh, don't worry about it...

320
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,250
I mean, I know that you're
really having fun

321
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,750
on the inside...
so cheer up!

322
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,750
If I'm being honest...
the truth is...

323
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,208
I don't know what I should do.

324
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,791
Miss Tsukamoto, even though
I can talk to you like this...

325
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,583
I guess I still don't know
how I really feel inside.

326
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,958
Say, Karasuma...

327
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,666
You like festivals,
don't you...?

328
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,833
Then let's just
have a good time!

329
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,208
All of us!

330
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,500
You're the perv who snuck into

331
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,083
the survival game, aren't you?

332
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:07,958
Ah...

333
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,666
Whatever do you mean, Mistress?

334
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,833
Look, just give me
my uniform back, okay?

335
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,208
I must offer
my deepest apologies

336
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,708
for making such a grave mistake.

337
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,583
When I first heard the
mistress would be entering

338
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,166
the battlefield, my concern
for her safety led me

339
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,541
to steal in as well.

340
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,875
But I couldn't keep
my old habits under control.

341
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,625
Despite how I appear now,

342
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,750
I was once in the
armed forces long ago.

343
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,333
Yes...

344
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,583
it was a special mission in a
small south American country,

345
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:11,666
where we put down a coup d'etat,
and rescued the president.

346
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,750
We did it!
We rescued the President!

347
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,083
The mission's successful!

348
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,833
Wait! There's still
a child in there!

349
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,583
A child?!

350
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,833
Stop! Our orders
are to fall back!

351
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,750
It's all right.

352
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,041
It's all right.

353
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,708
No... it's not ...

354
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,541
Go away, there's
no way to save me.

355
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,416
Do you have any
dreams for the future?

356
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,750
Huh?

357
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,291
What do you want to do...?

358
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,708
Is there anyone you look up to?

359
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,916
Is this your mother...? I see...

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,708
She must have been a
very good mother to you.

361
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,125
Live, for her sake.

362
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,375
Live and live for
as long as you can...

363
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,833
so you can grow up
to be a good person,

364
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,833
just like your mother was.

365
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,625
So... where is this child now?

366
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,916
Ah... the child
was taken in by me,

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,791
and now works as
a maid on this estate.

368
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,416
I've brought some more tea.

369
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,125
I thought you might
be running a bit low.

370
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,750
We were just talking about you.

371
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,583
Come in and say hello.

372
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,791
This is Masaru Suzuki.

373
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,375
He's very shy for a boy...

374
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,708
Ms. Osakabe,
where are you going?

375
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,333
What... the hell.

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,375
You guys haven't
decided what play to put on

377
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,791
for the culture festival!

378
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,000
Give me some proposals!

379
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,333
Mai, you're over-reacting.

380
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,833
Next on School Rumble:

381
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,250
"Wild Ideas about the Play!
Wild Ideas at the Bathhouse!

382
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,833
Wild Ideas about Rice Balls!"

383
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,166
Chill out, Mai.

384
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Chill out your face!

385
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,666
Hey...
