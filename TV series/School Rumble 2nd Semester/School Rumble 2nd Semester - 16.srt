1
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,166
Time to take a break.

2
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,583
Damn! She's cute!!!

3
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,625
I have got to
ask that girl out!!

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,291
Itoko! If you keep on
showing off like that,

5
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,458
all the guys are gonna
start hitting on you!

6
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,791
Oh, come on.

7
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,625
It happens all the time
when we're at home, Youko.

8
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,875
I can handle that.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,500
But if any more
guys come after you,

10
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,458
you won't have
any time left for me.

11
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,416
Okay, I understand.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,541
I'll play with you tonight,

13
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,666
but for now I need
some time by myself.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,041
Yay!!

15
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,041
That's so cool!

16
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that guy a professional?!

17
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,875
Hold on... It can't be--

18
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,375
Why am I so cold?

19
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,791
What the--?!

20
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,791
Tenma...?

21
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,708
I can't find Harima.
Do you know where he is?

22
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,208
No... I have no idea.

23
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,708
I can't believe Harima
had the nerve to try

24
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,458
and sneak into
Yakumo's room last night!

25
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,125
He's just a big,
stupid, hairy ape!

26
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,250
Don't worry, Yakumo...
I'll protect you!

27
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,291
Hi there. Name's Iori, right?

28
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,791
Listen, I could really use
a friend right about now.

29
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,083
Hey! Come back!!

30
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,041
Look! There's an old bum!

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,125
Let's see if he's still alive!

32
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop it!! Of course
I'm alive! Somebody help me!

33
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,125
Uh, Harima! What on
earth happened to you?

34
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,500
Well... for some reason,

35
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,208
I woke up outside,
tied up in a sleeping bag.

36
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,666
What's weird is I'm sure I fell
asleep in my room last night.

37
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,708
Hey, Tenma!
Do you know anything?

38
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,875
Perhaps you have the
problem of sleepwalking.

39
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,416
Oh, forget it.

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,208
I have to hurry up
and finish my pages!

41
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey! Do you have any idea
where all my things are?

42
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,333
Oh! You mean that big bag with
all that useless junk in it?

43
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,166
It's in the guest house.

44
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,708
Guest house?

45
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh no! My manuscript
could be ruined!

46
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,791
All your clothes
are out there too!

47
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,875
Damn it!

48
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,541
This is where you're
gonna stay from now on!

49
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,833
What? You serious?

50
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,208
Wait. Tenma, what are you doing?

51
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,208
Hey! Let me handle this, Yakumo.

52
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
I know you like him a lot.

53
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,708
But, he is still
a high school boy,

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,458
and that means he's only
got one thing on his mind.

55
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,416
It says so in "Modern Teen"!

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,083
All right! Let's finish this!

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,541
You are not allowed to
step foot in this house!

58
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,041
And, stay away from Yakumo!

59
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,916
Ya get me?

60
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,833
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,041
You know exactly what
I'm talkin' about!

62
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,708
Okay... Not gonna lie.
I have no clue.

63
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,541
So, you're gonna
play dumb, huh?!

64
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,375
You need to stop trying
to act all innocent, Harima...

65
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,250
You're guilty! Just admit it!

66
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,083
What is this about?
What am I guilty of?

67
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,000
Tenma, I don't
know what happened,

68
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,916
but don't you think
you're overdoing it?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,083
Oh, Yakumo. Don't be so naïve.

70
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,583
You had a really close
call yesterday, you know.

71
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
We were getting along so well.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,833
Why is she so mad at me now?

73
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,416
Okay.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,916
I just need to calm myself down,
so I can figure this out.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,083
Tenma must be in love with me.

76
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,041
And she actually
wanted me to confess.

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,375
But then I went into
Yakumo's room by mistake.

78
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,708
Now she's pissed!

79
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,750
So, she's actin' all crazy, ...

80
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:58,041
because she thinks I'm in
love with her little sister!

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,750
Don't you worry your
pretty little head, Tenma...

82
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,958
I'm gonna straighten
all this out tonight!

83
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,125
To make up for my
"screw up" yesterday,

84
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,625
and win back Tenma's heart,

85
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,041
I have to say somethin' that'll
make her all gooey inside.

86
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,666
I'm willing to die for you?

87
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,375
Uh... Please make me breakfast!

88
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,791
No, that's not right!

89
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:22,625
I got it! I'll just be honest...
and tell her how I feel!

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,125
Seriously!
Harima is so pathetic!

91
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,458
I did tell him off
pretty good though.

92
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,833
I guess I can let it go now.

93
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,916
Tonight my darling,
it's your turn!

94
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,875
You pervert!!
Get out of my house, now!

95
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,500
You couldn't have Yakumo,
so you came after me instead?!

96
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a complete maniac!

97
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,875
But Tenma! That's not it all!
Just listen to me!

98
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,750
Son of a...

99
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,791
I really screwed up this time.

100
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,500
Now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

101
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,416
No Tenma... and no place
to finish my manuscript.

102
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,958
I made a reservation
at an awesome restaurant!

103
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:14,958
Really?!

104
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,500
It'll be ultimate
oral experience.

105
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,875
That could be me and Tenma,
if I hadn't messed things up.

106
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,625
Harima, my love.

107
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,083
Why don't we go to my place?

108
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,666
I'll make you a
fantastic dinner!

109
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,875
Oh, Tenma! You
finally understand!

110
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,416
Harima? What're you
doing over there?

111
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,375
Some punk was
giving me the stinkeye,

112
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,208
so I had to teach him a lesson!

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,666
Um, that was a statue.

114
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,875
Aw, I can't believe
you don't have

115
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,458
anywhere to go for Christmas.

116
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,583
You're like a sad little
stray puppy wandering

117
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,625
around in the freezing cold.

118
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,625
That really sucks.

119
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,916
Well, you know if you want to,

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,750
you could always come
and stay at my place.

121
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,708
Of course, it's not actually
my house, it's Hanai's dojo.

122
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,291
but, everyone is free to come
and go as they like there.

123
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,750
Yeah thanks,

124
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,791
but I really wouldn't want
to put you out or anything.

125
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,416
Then, where are you gonna go?

126
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't worry about it...
I'll figure it out.

127
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:16,125
Hey man, it's your call.
See you later then.

128
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,291
In any case, I need to find
a way to make some money.

129
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,791
I got tissues. Does anybody
want some tissues?

130
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,666
Here ya go.

131
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,916
So, I had to buy a lot of food

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,875
for the Christmas
party at the dojo.

133
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,958
If you don't mind,

134
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,250
I could use your
help carrying these.

135
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,458
This is the living room.

136
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,083
Feel free to use the sofa,
and anything else ya need.

137
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,583
Sorry for imposing.

138
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,166
Don't worry about it.

139
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,541
You're home kinda late.

140
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,791
Yeah, sorry about that.

141
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,541
Something important came up.

142
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,041
So anyway, are
you hungry at all?

143
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,583
I guess I could eat something.

144
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,041
Do you really think
this is all right?

145
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,666
I mean letting me crash
at the dojo like this?

146
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,458
Man, I'm so hungry.

147
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,125
I'll have to grab
something from the kitchen.

148
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,250
She said it would be
okay to go wherever

149
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,291
I want as long as I keep
this worker's outfit on.

150
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Sucks that I can't
wear my shades, though.

151
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,875
Refrigerator... Refrigerator...

152
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,166
Score! That's what
I'm talkin 'bout!

153
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,666
I miss the food
at Tenma's house.

154
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,416
The meals there
were somethin' else.

155
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,041
Hello? Is someone there?

156
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,583
Crap!! Mikoto's family!

157
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
What the hell is
Rich Girl doin' here?

158
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,291
Oh. Are you a worker
here or something?

159
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,333
Wait a second.

160
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,416
She doesn't know
who I am. Awesome.

161
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,708
Yes, that's right.

162
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,333
I was about to make
some coffee for Miss Suou.

163
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,333
All right! I gotta sell it!

164
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,208
If she recognizes me,
I'm totally screwed!

165
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,083
You know, I'm heading
up there anyway,

166
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,708
I could bring it to her for you.

167
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,458
I wouldn't dream of
asking you to do that.

168
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,500
This is all just a
part of my job, Miss.

169
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,500
The coffee will
be ready shortly,

170
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,958
no need to trouble yourself.

171
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,000
It's working!

172
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,125
Here is your coffee, miss.

173
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,666
Uh... Thank you!

174
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,666
What the hell is he doing?

175
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,375
I'll leave you alone then, Miss.

176
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,916
Thank you very much.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,458
What the hell is she doing?

178
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,750
Yes!! Perfect!

179
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,458
Is there something wrong?

180
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,750
Oh, no. Just thinking.

181
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,541
Wait, sir, excuse me.

182
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,583
Crap! She couldn't
have figured me out!

183
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,083
My acting was perfect!

184
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,583
Sorry. But, Mikoto wanted
me to give this to you.

185
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,291
Did you drop it?

186
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,416
He just took it
without saying a thing.

187
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,458
What is his deal?

188
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,250
Does he always act like that?

189
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,166
Oh, yeah ...
Come to think of it,

190
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,750
he has always been a
little on the withdrawn side.

191
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,125
Oh...

192
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,916
 So, what do ya think? Huh, Eri?

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,833
Feelin' a little bit hot
in your nether regions?

194
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,833
What are you talking about?!

195
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,125
Are you outta your mind?!

196
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,625
Although...

197
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,250
From the back at least,
he looked kinda nice...

198
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,833
If you know what I mean...

199
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,083
Oh, really?

200
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,541
Hey! Stop tryin'
to play matchmaker!

201
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,041
Damn it!

202
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,500
If she finds me out, she'll
never let me live it down!

203
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,458
It'll be all over!
I gotta get outta here!

204
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
Excuse me, sir?

205
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,333
What the hell'd ya do that for?

206
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,708
You should've seen your face!

207
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,625
I have to say, though, it is
really hard to tell it's you.

208
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,791
Nice disguise!

209
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,041
Yeah, whatever!

210
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,666
Anyway, I have to go out
and run some errands,

211
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,333
so I'm leaving you in charge.

212
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,750
Take care of the
house and be good.

213
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,250
Don't let me down!

214
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,458
What?! You're leaving
me here with her?

215
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,291
We can't very well leave her
here by herself, now, can we?

216
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,791
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

217
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,791
As far as she's concerned,

218
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,416
you're just a dude
who works here.

219
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,791
She's been really stressed...

220
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,833
She won't talk to me about it.

221
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,791
Who knows?

222
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,791
Since she thinks
you're stranger,

223
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,708
she might actually
open up to you.

224
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,500
It's funny.

225
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,583
I never thought I'd be glad
to be in Hanai's dojo...

226
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,833
I messed up again!

227
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,666
It's raining.

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,666
The dark clouds,
a perfect mirror of my soul.

229
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,500
It's so depressing.

230
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,958
I should be at Tenma's house
having a warm meal right now.

231
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,125
Rich girl?

232
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:45,958
Of course.

233
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,500
It would start raining
all of a sudden.

234
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,125
Oh ... Um...
Thank you very much.

235
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,916
No problem.
I'm just doin' my job.

236
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,583
I'll finish for you.

237
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,916
You have to stop
dropping your arm!

238
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,375
Keep practicing. You're
making great progress.

239
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,083
Really impressive
for your first time!

240
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,583
Mikoto. You're amazing!

241
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,208
Well, I've been
at it for a while.

242
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,791
Did you work up a good sweat?

243
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,500
Yeah.

244
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,250
Me too. I'm 'onna
go hit the shower.

245
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,625
Sure.

246
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,583
Oh. Right.

247
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,291
I need to bring
Harima some food.

248
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,250
Thank you.

249
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,833
That was really refreshing.

250
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,958
Sorry I took so long.

251
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,500
Mikoto, are you in here?

252
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,750
Hey, are you there?

253
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,416
You're so quiet.

254
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,625
Did you fall
asleep or something?

255
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,583
Geez, you're creepin' me out.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
No!

257
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,583
Ugh, crap. That took
way longer than expected.

258
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,375
I wonder if she's
still even in there.

259
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,791
Mikoto, you're so strong!

260
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,083
You could've gone a
little easier on me though.

261
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,291
My entire body is
covered in bruises.

262
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,750
Why is Eri talking to herself?

263
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,041
When did this become
a co-ed bath?!

264
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,291
What the hell are
those two doing?

265
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,291
I do feel a lot better
though, so thank you.

266
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,666
I'd love to keep learning,
if you don't mind.

267
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,500
Hey, are youou listening
to me over there?

268
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,833
Aw, crap! I'm gonna
get kicked out again!

269
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,416
Just when I found
a safe place to stay!

270
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,291
Damn...! Stupid Rich Girl!

271
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,166
How could you mistake
me for Mikoto?!

272
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,833
Do I look like a girl to you?

273
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,500
It's too late!

274
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,416
There's no way to save
myself! I'm so dead!

275
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey, Mikoto.

276
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,666
Have things been going
well between you and Asou?

277
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,916
Who the heck are you
talking about? Asou?

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,916
What's wrong with you?

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,083
The guy you've been hanging out

280
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,750
with lately from the
basketball team?

281
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,833
Asou!

282
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,333
Oh yeah, him.

283
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,166
You know, I'm not all that sure.

284
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,375
To be honest... I'm not
really interested in guys.

285
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,625
Oh! I didn't know that!

286
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,541
Okay! This is going well!

287
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,500
I'm a better actor
than I thought!

288
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,791
Oh, it's Mikoto! Perfect timing!

289
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:04,083
Please save me! If you
don't, I'm a dead man!

290
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,541
Okay. Just follow my lead.

291
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,375
Thanks a lot!
I owe you big time!

292
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,958
Hey, are you getting sick?

293
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,041
Your voice sounds
a little strange.

294
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,291
I never knew your
back was so ripped!

295
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,166
You almost seem
like a different person!

296
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,916
Oh! That's normal!

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,375
You know how your muscles
tighten after a workout!

298
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,416
Yeah? Well, yours
are like way tight.

299
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,916
And, I think I might
be getting sick.

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,750
Yes! Looks like I'll live
to fight another day!

301
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,083
By the way, Eri.

302
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,000
When are you gonna confess
your feelings to Harima?

303
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,875
What the--?!

304
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
Have you gone completely insane?

305
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,458
I'm not even
talking to that idiot!

306
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,666
I saw him on the
street yesterday.

307
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,958
I thought he was a homeless man.

308
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,291
Who would wanna be
with a guy like that?

309
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,458
But, you know?

310
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,541
There is a lot of romance in
the air these days, isn't there?

311
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:01,000
Madoka and Umezu,
Nagayama and Tanaka.

312
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,916
There's even you and Asou.

313
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,750
Help me get outta here!

314
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,291
Hang on a second!

315
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,750
What about you, Eri?

316
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, it looks like I'm gonna
have to get married pretty soon.

317
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,666
My parents are making me go
to an engagement meeting...

318
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,750
Damn! You scared me!

319
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,291
I seriously thought you
were saying... Oh, never mind.

320
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,708
If it's just a meeting, then
you can turn it down, right?

321
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,125
Or would that cause
problems with your family?

322
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,750
So what if it does?

323
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,125
I'm gonna reject it,
no matter what it costs me.

324
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,458
I'm coming in, okay?

325
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,166
Damn it! No!!!
She's gonna kill me!

326
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,625
Please do something!

327
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,875
Oh, no! I forgot
he was in there!

328
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,333
I've gotta get out
of here! Fast!

329
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,375
That was way too
frickin' close for comfort.

330
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
I had no choice! Cut it out!!

331
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,375
You stupid jerk!!

332
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,791
I used my towel
to make air bubbles!

333
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,125
It wasn't what it looked like!

334
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
How the hell is Eri
supposed to know that...?

335
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,083
Do you know what this does
to a girls reputation?

336
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,625
But still, poor Eri...
I mean, an arranged marriage...?

337
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,958
I feel so bad for her,

338
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,333
no wonder she's been
acting so strange lately.

339
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,541
Man... She's still a
high school student.

340
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,208
They expect her to get
married when she's this young?

341
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,708
I'll never understand
the way rich people think.

342
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,000
Eh, there's nothin' I can do.

343
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,416
Might sound selfish...

344
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,208
but I got my hands full
worrying about my own problems.

345
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,375
I understand.

346
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,708
Hey, it's pretty
chilly in the dojo.

347
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,875
You can sleep
here again tonight.

348
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,750
Thanks. I appreciate it.

349
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,041
This frickin' blows!

350
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,958
I've only gotten
ten pages finished!! Damn!

351
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,666
Jerks...! What is it now?!

352
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,916
Hello. Are you Mikoto's father?

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,083
Is ... she at home right now?

354
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,083
What do you mean father?

355
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,250
Get outta here jackass.

356
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,083
Scram! Don't make me ask twice!

357
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,000
Seriously!

358
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,708
Can't a person get any
work done around here?

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,666
What the hell is it this time?

360
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,041
You better knock
it off, pretty boy!

361
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Please accept my apologies.

362
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,083
I am Nakamura, the
Sawachika family's butler.

363
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:48,291
I'm looking for the
little Miss. Is she here?

364
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,250
The little Miss? Oh.

365
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,583
You mean the rich girl.

366
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,958
If you're looking
for her, she's...

367
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,541
Hey!!

368
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,166
Stop pushing!

369
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,791
What were you doing out there?

370
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,958
Are you stupid?
We can't just give her away!

371
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,166
Eri needs our help right now.

372
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,666
Looks like Nakamura is here ...

373
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,041
I guess it's time
for me to get going.

374
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,375
But ... you can't.

375
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,833
Don't worry about it.

376
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,166
I already told you, Miko,
I'm gonna turn the guy down.

377
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
 Well, ... this is it.

378
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,708
Thanks for taking care of me.

379
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,166
You...! You're coming
with me right now!

380
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,208
First of all, I'm not
feeling this outfit...

381
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,916
Second of all, what
the heck are you doing?

382
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,333
Helping you...

383
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,833
and I'll loan
you my worker, too.

384
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,000
Now... Take the motorbike
and get out of here.

385
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,791
It'll at least buy you
some time to think or,

386
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,416
whatever, just do it!

387
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,041
I'm not going anywhere!

388
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,833
I've still got work to do!

389
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,541
You're working for the
Suou family, remember?!!

390
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,833
You'll do what I tell you to do!

391
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,458
I'm counting on you.

392
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,625
You're crazy, woman.

393
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,708
What are you trying to pull?

394
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,708
I don't have time for this BS!

395
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,041
Okay! I'll take
care of the rest!

396
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,541
That was fun...

397
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
Now then, what to
do about this guy...

398
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,500
No matter what,
you must find Miss Eri.

399
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,791
That was nice. Feels
so good to be clean again.

400
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,208
The grime of the
past year is gone

401
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,875
and now I'm
gonna start fresh.

402
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,625
Yoshidayama is gonna be
the big man on campus...

403
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,791
Watch out Harima...!

404
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,833
Soon, I'll turn him
into my pet slave.

405
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,625
Then, I'll mock him and
kick him around in front

406
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,000
of his beloved Eri!

407
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,208
Miss Eri. I've found you.

408
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,791
What the hell?
Do I look like a girl to you?

409
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,583
Whoopsy. You're not the Miss.

410
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,083
Damn it! Why should I have

411
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,666
to run around protecting
this rich brat

412
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,083
when I have a comic to finish?!

413
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,500
Next time on School Rumble
Second Semester:

414
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,666
"Eri's Escape, Harima's
Lullaby, The False Bride"!

415
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,333
Rich Girl.
You're actin' strange!
