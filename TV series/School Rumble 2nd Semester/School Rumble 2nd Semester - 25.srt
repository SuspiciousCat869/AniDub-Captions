1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,416
This is Yurei and Otama...

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,166
Otama is always
there behind Yurei...

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,458
The two of them
are always together.

4
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,541
Damn it... after being
adrift for all that time,

5
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,416
I'm way behind on these layouts.

6
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,291
Look, I'm sorry, but
I'm gonna need one more hour!

7
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,416
What's... that for?

8
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,666
Your last comic
was too realistic.

9
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,916
Next time make sure to
draw me one I can publish.

10
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,416
He's such a hard ass!

11
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,583
Well, I at least gave this
one a more exotic location...

12
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,750
That should do it.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
Tenma's Sister sure
is takin' her time.

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,291
She told me she'd be
here well before six.

15
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,583
I bet that's her now!

16
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,000
You made it just in time...
we've gotta lotta...

17
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,625
Hey, hey!

18
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,250
Ten... T-T-T!

19
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,333
What is Tenma doing here?!

20
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,416
Harima! Yakumo couldn't make
it so I came in her place!

21
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,791
Hey, let me in or
I'll blow your house down!

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,333
Check out the snackage...!
So is it okay to come in?

23
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,041
Yes, of course...! Come in!

24
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,333
Thank you, sir!

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
Itoko's shoes!

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,458
Um... What's the matter?

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,958
Oh, lately I haven't
been getting much exercise,

28
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,291
so I need to work out!

29
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,125
Okay!

30
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,333
Okay then! Come in, come in!

31
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,916
Wow, Harima... you... sure...

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,916
do live in a really
nice apartment!

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,583
Yeah... I guess.

34
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,416
Hey, Kenji, you
got company out there?

35
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,125
Is someone else here?

36
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,833
No...! That was... the TV!

37
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,625
The work room is
right down the hall!

38
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,208
But-but...!

39
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,083
Now you just sit tight there
while I put on some tea, okay?!

40
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,416
But-b-but, Harima?!

41
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,208
Oh, man, that was a close one...

42
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,625
I wasn't expecting
Tenma to show up.

43
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,333
You're right, this is a
once in a lifetime chance.

44
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,750
Don't... do that!

45
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,083
Damn you...! You knew
she was here, didn't you?!

46
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,791
Pretty sure I'm in the way here.

47
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,541
So I'm going out for a bit.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,833
Looks like you two
will be all alone here...

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,541
Try not to blow it.

50
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:30,500
Me?

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,083
All alone here with Tenma?

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,375
Hey I got some, I mean
I made some, I... Tea!

53
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,416
Wow!

54
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,375
You can see
Yagami Harbor from here!

55
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,500
And Yagami Bridge!

56
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,416
It's romantic... isn't it?

57
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,083
Yeah... I s'pose.

58
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,291
Ah, this is so exciting!

59
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,291
Oh, this is so exciting!

60
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,375
After all, this
is the first time

61
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,458
I've been a professional
artist's assistant...!

62
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,291
I'll have to work really hard!

63
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,041
Yeah... right... really hard.

64
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,208
Hey... are these the
layouts...? Lemme see.

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,083
No!! Don't look!

66
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,291
But... why not?

67
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,875
Why... why not?

68
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,708
Because they're not ready
to be seen, that's why...!

69
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,708
I have my professional
pride, y'know!

70
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,750
I see...! You're just trying
to be pro...! I get it, homie!

71
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,750
Thanks... Why don't
you just sit down

72
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,333
and have some tea while
I finish polishing these up?

73
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,208
No problem!

74
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,375
That was a close call.

75
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,250
If she'd seen these, the cat
would really be out of the bag.

76
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,916
Hey, uh... your sister...

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,083
why wasn't she able to make it?

78
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,250
Good question...

79
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,083
I don't know, she
just said she was busy

80
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,875
and wouldn't be able to come.

81
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,291
I see.

82
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,791
Strange...

83
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,791
Tenma's Sister didn't
say anything about this

84
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,416
on the phone this morning.

85
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,708
She's usually
so conscientious...

86
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,250
I'm surprised she didn't call
me when something came up.

87
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,416
There! My secret's safe!

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,791
You know, it surprises me.

89
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,250
What does?

90
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,916
You really can't judge
people by appearances.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,083
I never would've thought you
were the artist type, Harima.

92
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,333
You're not the only one...

93
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll tell you, I was
really impressed

94
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,958
with that book you drew before.

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,166
You're so talented, it's really
raised my opinion of you!

96
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,208
Let's do this... I'm ready!

97
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,291
Harima, you're so great...

98
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,250
I think I've fallen
in love with you.

99
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,083
I wanna be by
your side always...

100
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,166
that's why I came
here like this.

101
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,333
That's what's going on here!

102
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:39,250
Right...! So all I have to
do is make my move...! But...

103
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,458
making a direct confession
might be a little awkward...

104
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:47,750
Maybe I'll try dropping a few
subtle hints first. Yeah...

105
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,583
There!

106
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,333
Okay... the pages are all ready
for you, assistant Tsukamoto!

107
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,458
Let me explain a little
bit of the plot to you...

108
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,791
this is a story about
a man and a woman

109
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,041
who were on a cruise ship that
hit a storm and went adrift.

110
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,333
M-hm, m-hm...

111
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,625
This is the hero...

112
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,000
Mm-hmm!!

113
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,708
And this is the heroine...

114
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,375
Attractive.

115
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,041
Do these two...
look like anyone you know?

116
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,208
Huh...?

117
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,708
Those... those two people...

118
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,958
Yes...! Those two people...?

119
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,833
They appeared in
your last comic book!

120
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,500
This story is a
continuation of that one!

121
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,125
Yeah... good guess.

122
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,916
I forget how dumb she is!

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,125
I'll just have to
spell it out for her.

124
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,208
Uh, look...

125
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,375
What's up?

126
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,791
It's like this...

127
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,625
Artists subconsciously
reveal their deepest thoughts

128
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,333
and emotions
through their drawings.

129
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,166
Oh... yeah,
I've heard about that.

130
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,958
Well, that's true of
this comic book too.

131
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,375
It's the expression
of my very soul.

132
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,166
You see...?!
I am the main character!

133
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,500
What's more, I really am
in love with the heroine!

134
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,500
And... to tell the truth...
that... heroine...

135
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:04,958
Phone call!

136
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,250
Crap, who is it?!

137
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,750
Hey, Kenji How's it goin'?

138
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
Have you confessed
to your love Tenma yet?

139
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,166
Mind your own business!

140
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,083
Good grief...

141
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,250
of all the times to call and
check on me, it had to be now!

142
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,083
Way cool...! Harima,
your ring tone is the theme

143
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,250
from "Three for the Kill"
just like mine!

144
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,708
You see, we match!

145
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,291
Whoa! what an
awesome coincidence!

146
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,250
Uh-huh...! Oh, crap!

147
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,041
What is it...? What's wrong?

148
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,125
I forgot there's a "Three for
the Kill" special on today!

149
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,250
Oh, no, look at the time,
it started thirty minutes ago!

150
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,791
We missed the first half hour,

151
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,625
there's no way we'll be able
to follow what's going on!

152
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,583
Wait!

153
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,166
Yakumo could be recording it!

154
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,166
You think?!

155
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,333
Yeah, I'll text
her and find out!

156
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,291
All right... we're in the clear!

157
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,375
Oh, snap!

158
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,125
Yakumo Tsukamoto:
Prepared as usual.

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,166
Thank goodness...! I'll lend
it to you later, Harima!

160
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,166
Thank you, thank you!

161
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,541
Have you been having fun, Iori?

162
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,041
I did it...

163
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,833
I sent Sis over
to help Harima out

164
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,416
with the artwork on
his comic book today.

165
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,250
I've been thinking about
doing it for a while... but...

166
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,666
...did Karasuma ever come
to your sister's party?

167
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,541
Oh, yeah... After the
party he came by our house.

168
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,958
I see.

169
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,583
It's like...
I have all this motivation!

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,250
I think...
Harima really likes Sis...

171
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:26,083
But... Sis doesn't
seem to realize it.

172
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,541
I want Sis to
see more of Harima.

173
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,833
Have you been getting
into trouble again?

174
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,541
Look at this...

175
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,541
This is Sis, when
she was in middle school.

176
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,666
No doubt... It's eighty-nine!

177
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,916
"Farewell, Three!

178
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,125
Flowers of Evil Bloom
on the Kamakura Road!"

179
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,875
is without question
the best episode ever!

180
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,500
Oh, yeah...! Mangoku's fight
scenes totally kicked ass!

181
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,625
On the other hand, episode
forty-three is pretty good too!

182
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,625
Yeah...! "Hurry Up,
There's Love Trouble

183
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,166
on Nakasendo Road"
was classic, I was in tears!

184
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,500
And Okiku's guest appearance
was totally awesome,

185
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,625
don't you think?

186
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,375
Artistically, we are as one.

187
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,458
I should've known!

188
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,916
We're a perfect match
for each other!

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,375
You know, it's just amazing!

190
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,000
I had no idea you
were a Mangoku fan!

191
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:42,000
I had no idea you were
a Mangoku fan either!

192
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,833
It's like...
we're perfectly matched!

193
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,666
Oh, wow...

194
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,875
For the last time,
mind your own business!

195
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,625
Uh, Tazawa? This is Mitsui.

196
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,625
I was just checking in...
how's it going?

197
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,041
Fine, just fine...

198
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,458
Great, make sure you bring
it by tomorrow morning...

199
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,000
That gonna be a problem?

200
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,916
No, not at all.

201
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,125
Remember, the big boss
is counting on you,

202
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,875
so make sure you don't
let him down this time...

203
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,000
Hang in there!

204
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,375
Is something wrong?

205
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,875
Oh, they're hounding
me for my story.

206
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,666
When is the manuscript due?

207
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,916
In the morning.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,625
Oh my gosh...! We should hurry!

209
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,250
No, no, it's cool.
It doesn't matter if it's late!

210
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,416
It really doesn't matter...

211
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,166
All I need is for you to
finally know how I feel.

212
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,083
I'm not gonna let
you give up like this!

213
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,375
You've got too much
talent to waste it...!

214
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,541
Besides, I want to see your
story get published in Zinegama!

215
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,125
Really...?

216
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,833
And I'll help you... we'll go
steady down the path to success!

217
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:48,625
Go steady...

218
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,708
Go steady... Go steady...

219
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,541
Go steady...

220
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,916
You... you say you'll
go steady with me?

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
Duh...! Of course I will!

222
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,583
Yeah...! Let's get to work!

223
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,041
Whoa, yeah!!

224
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,916
Big Sister Power...

225
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,791
You haven't changed at all.

226
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,375
That picture book...

227
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,000
Once this story is done there'll
be time for everything else.

228
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,583
There's no need to rush things.

229
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,125
We can just take it slow

230
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,708
and spend more and
more time together.

231
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,750
That's what going steady
is all about, right, Tenma?

232
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,416
Um, I was thinkin'...

233
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,791
What?

234
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,875
If we finish up before daybreak,

235
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,208
you think you might wanna take
a ride up the coast on my bike?

236
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,583
Up the coast?

237
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,875
Yeah... when the morning
sun rises out of the water,

238
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,916
it's incredibly beautiful.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,625
Yeah...! Sounds great!

240
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,041
Whoa, you mean it?!

241
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,083
Brush... brush... brush...

242
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:00,916
Huh?

243
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,083
Huh?

244
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,750
How... how could she do this?

245
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,875
I'll have to redraw
the whole thing!

246
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,625
I'll never make it in time now!

247
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,208
What...? Is that wrong?

248
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,458
No, not at all...! It's perfect!

249
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,666
Yes! What should I do next?

250
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,250
Uh... For now, how about
just sharpening my pencils?

251
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,500
Okie-doke!

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,125
You know...

253
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,041
I know just how your
main character feels...

254
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,958
Unrequited love stinks.

255
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,333
Huh?

256
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,958
And then, just when it
seems like the right moment,

257
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,291
you can't confess how you feel!

258
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,958
Yeah, that's it exactly!

259
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,458
So you think...

260
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,958
if I just spend as much
time with him as possible...

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,375
But no... if you don't say
it they just don't get it.

262
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,625
Gotta be brave.

263
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,583
Oh, Tenma, I'm such a pansy...!

264
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,541
Even after you've said
you'd go steady with me,

265
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,791
I still don't have the guts to
declare my feelings to you!

266
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:58,000
I've gotta flat out declare my
love to Karasuma! Straight up!

267
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,083
Just you wait! I'm gonna
declare my love, straight up!

268
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,750
Tenma!

269
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,375
Huh?

270
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,708
The truth is, I'm...

271
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,166
I'm, uh... hungry.

272
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,333
So am I!

273
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,958
Maybe we should order out.

274
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey, why don't
I make something for you?

275
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,500
What...?! No, please don't...

276
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,333
Oh, relax, it's no trouble!

277
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,875
No... that's not
what I'm sayin'...

278
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,625
Where are your spices?

279
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,666
Uh... good question.

280
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,000
Guess I'll have to ask Itoko.

281
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,333
Looks like things
are going pretty well.

282
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,000
The spices are under the sink.

283
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,666
Oh, thank you...

284
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,250
Hey, Tenma... you'll find
the spices under the sink.

285
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,416
Hey...! How'd you
know I was gonna...?

286
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,416
She wouldn't have the
place bugged, would she?

287
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,041
Okay, soup's on!

288
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,708
You shouldn't have.

289
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,791
Ahh...!

290
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I kind of messed it up, huh?

291
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,500
No! It's delicious!

292
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,375
Really delicious.

293
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,291
Maybe we should have a drink.

294
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:26,041
That's a good idea...
I'll be right back...

295
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,041
Man... how in the
hell can anyone manage

296
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,250
to make something
that tastes so bad...?

297
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,916
It's like she's an artist at it!

298
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,458
However!

299
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,958
The important thing is that
we got through it together...!

300
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,875
Experiences like this are
what going steady is all about!

301
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,166
I made us some coffee...

302
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,333
You want some...? Huh?

303
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,041
Ah...! Here it is!

304
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,041
Yurei and Otama.

305
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,958
Otama was always
there behind Yurei...

306
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,500
The two of them
were always together.

307
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,791
When they were eating...
Yurei would say,

308
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,625
"I don't want any more."

309
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,333
"Yurei, you should
eat all your food."

310
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,541
When they were playing...

311
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,875
Yurei would say,

312
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,541
"I want this one!"

313
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,625
"Yurei, that toy
belongs to her."

314
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,041
And when everyone
went out together...

315
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,375
Yurei said,

316
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,416
"I wanna go this way!"

317
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,125
"But, Yurei, everyone
else is going that way!"

318
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,583
"That's okay,
I wanna go this way...

319
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,000
If you wanna go with everyone
else, Otama, you go ahead."

320
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,666
"Yurei, you want
to be all alone?"

321
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,458
Yurei replied, "Yeah,
I'll be fine all alone."

322
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,208
Otama seemed sad somehow...

323
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,458
However, she
didn't say anything.

324
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,708
"I don't care
what you do, Otama."

325
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:05,041
Then Yurei started trudging
away, all by herself.

326
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,750
How long is she
planning to sleep...?

327
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,166
Well, at least
I'm getting more work done.

328
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,875
Come to think of it, this has
happened before, hasn't it?

329
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,666
Lookin' back, this
is how it all started.

330
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,291
I love you...

331
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,833
Ever since then,
I've been in love with you.

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,916
You disgust me!

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,416
Thanks for nothing, Mr. Pervert!

334
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,750
That's when I started
wearing sunglasses,

335
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,208
and grew a beard,
so I could be someone else,

336
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,541
so I could be near you...

337
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,833
A lot has happened... but this
long drama will soon be over.

338
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,583
I know, without any doubt...

339
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,666
you and I will
have a happy ending!

340
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,166
But I can't think about
that now...! Back to work!

341
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,958
Sure, I can still eat
another bowl...! Bring it on!

342
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,291
Man, she's even
hungry in her sleep!

343
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,708
Yeah...

344
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,208
Come on... Harima, dear.

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,666
No, no, no!

346
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm not that kind of man...!
Think of something else...!

347
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,916
Something else...!
Something else!

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,666
Come on... Harima dear.

349
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
Not like that!

350
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,041
Ah, son of a...!

351
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:39,833
Huh?

352
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,041
Doowah!

353
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,625
Now you will have
to face me in battle.

354
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,583
Love you...

355
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,541
Yurei started trudging
away, all by herself...

356
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,583
Step after step she plodded on.

357
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,083
"Oh, look at the flowers!"...

358
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,208
But there was no one behind her.

359
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,708
"Oh, a shooting star!"...

360
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,791
But there was nobody there.

361
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,625
Yurei went home
all by herself...

362
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,958
Once she got home,
there was still nobody there.

363
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,750
When she was eating,
and when she was playing,

364
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,833
and when she was cleaning,
she was all alone.

365
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,375
"Otama... where did you go?"...

366
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,375
Yurei decided to look for Otama.

367
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,000
She asked the
worm on the flower...

368
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,916
"Mr. Worm, Mr. Worm...
where did Otama go?"

369
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,333
"Yurei," said the worm,
"I'm so hungry I can't move."

370
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,125
"Well then,
I'll give you my food."

371
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:06,125
"Thank you. I saw Otama
looking at some flowers.

372
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,916
"Thank you,
Mr. Worm," said Yurei.

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,958
She asked two twins
on the beach...

374
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,541
"Say, you two... do you
know where Otama is?"

375
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,458
"Yurei," said the twins,

376
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,958
"we're sad because we
only have one toy."

377
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,583
"In that case," said Yurei,
"I'll give you mine."

378
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,916
Thank you, Yurei...!

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,833
We saw Otama watching a
shooting star over there!"

380
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,291
"Thank you, twins."

381
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,125
Everyone had seen her...

382
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:40,541
but no matter how far she
walked, Otama was not there.

383
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,750
"Otama," she said,
"where did you go?"

384
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,250
Yurei finally started to cry...

385
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:50,833
The tears ran down...
one after the other...

386
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,166
and made a puddle...

387
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,750
"Otama... where have you gone?"

388
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,458
Is this really what you want?

389
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,916
Admit it...

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,166
...you're in love
with Harima yourself.

391
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,458
♪ ending song ♪

392
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Wow, it sure is hard work
being an artist's assistant!

00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,875
But you slept through it all!
