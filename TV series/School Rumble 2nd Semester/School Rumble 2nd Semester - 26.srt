1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,291
Love you.

2
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,208
Is this what you really
want...? Admit it...

3
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,750
you're in love with Harima,
aren't you?

4
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,041
Well, I ...

5
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,208
You've found someone
you really love...

6
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,750
Why throw that away?

7
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,208
But Harima is in love
with Sis, not with me...

8
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,916
And that's why you want your
sister to see more of Harima...

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,208
You care for her
more than yourself.

10
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,375
Is this what will
really make you happy...

11
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,083
giving the one you
love to your sister?

12
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,250
If you do this,
you could end up all alone...

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,958
all alone for the
rest of your life.

14
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,583
Is that what you want?

15
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,208
I... I don't...

16
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,250
You once said...

17
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,750
you were sure you'd fall
in love with someone.

18
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,583
I thought Harima might be
the someone that you meant...

19
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,458
why are you being
so selfless, I wonder...

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,625
What's really going on
deep behind those eyes?

21
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:13,458
Ya'mo... Ya'mo...
Ya'mo... Ya'mo...

22
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,791
Ya'mo, where are you?

23
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,791
Tenma!

24
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,000
Ya... mo!

25
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:25,083
What's wrong...?
Ya'mo, why do you look so angry?

26
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,625
How many times do I have to tell
you...?! Don't call me "Ya'mo"!

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,458
My name's "Yakumo"...! Don't
talk to me like you're a baby!

28
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,291
It's immature,
and I don't like it!

29
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,916
Ya... Yaku... uh...

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,166
See...? That's what
I'm taking about...!

31
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,875
That's why all the other kids
at school make fun of you!

32
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,208
I'm sorry... Y-Ya'mo...

33
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,583
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,083
I just told you I don't
want you to call me "Ya'mo"!

35
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,625
Ya'mo...

36
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,041
I'll help you with your
picture painting homework, okay?

37
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,000
No way... you always mess
up everything you touch,

38
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,250
so just leave me alone.

39
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,916
Uh-uh... I'm helpful!

40
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,875
I can do it!

41
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,875
And I was doing such a good job!

42
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,916
I'm sorry, Ya'mo, I'm sorry!

43
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,125
Ya'mo...

44
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,458
Is that clay...?
Are you going to make a lion?

45
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,500
Yes, I am! Now just go away!

46
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,500
Yay!

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,541
I'm really, really good
at working with clay!

48
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,916
It's okay now, don't worry...

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,041
I'm gonna make it a
handsome lion just watch...

50
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,166
Huh...? What's that?

51
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,083
Oh, I knew it...! Tenma,
you're such a dummy!

52
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,333
Uh... you see...

53
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,458
your book was dirty,
so I was trying to clean it.

54
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,125
Why?

55
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,500
Why did you do this to me?

56
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,916
Huh?

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,333
You can't do anything...!
You always get in my way!

58
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,083
Ya'mo...

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,208
I don't want you
anywhere near me!

60
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,208
I don't want you as my sister,
I wish you'd go away!

61
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,041
I'm really sorry, Sis...
it's just that

62
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,750
when you wash clothes
that way they get clean,

63
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,708
so... I thought...

64
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,958
Shut up!

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,375
Ya'mo?

66
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:38,125
Here... I'll let you borrow
my favorite game, okay...?

67
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,416
It's got your
favorite animal in it...

68
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,625
I want it back!

69
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,458
This... this was the book...

70
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,291
I got from Dad...

71
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,833
I hate you, Tenma!

72
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,708
I... I hate you, Tenma!

73
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,458
Hey... Daddy?

74
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,333
Daddy, would you
read this to me!

75
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,333
Yurei finally started to cry...

76
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,791
The tears ran down...
one after the other...

77
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,916
and made a puddle...

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,791
"Otama... where have you gone?"

79
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,333
"Yurei..."

80
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,583
Opening her eyes,

81
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,250
Yurei saw Otama in the
middle of the puddle.

82
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:49,250
"Otama! Otama,
are you in the water?"

83
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,750
"I am always with you,
Yurei," Otama said.

84
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,625
When she turned around,
Otama was looking at her.

85
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,416
Yurei wasn't able to see Otama,

86
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,750
but she was always
there, behind her.

87
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,333
"Otama, were you by
my side the whole time?"

88
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,333
"That's right, I'm back, Yurei!"

89
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,250
"Welcome back... Otama!"

90
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,541
And so, the two of
them became closer

91
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,875
than they ever were before,
and made lots of friends.

92
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:48,208
Why...? Why does Tenma
always come to my side?

93
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,208
She can't do anything right...

94
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,625
but she always tries
to be nice to me.

95
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,583
My sister...

96
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,083
When it became
just the two of us...

97
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,750
I know Tenma must
have been lonely too.

98
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,333
But... She was always so
kindhearted and warm to me...

99
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,208
the perfect sister...

100
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,750
Of all the people
in the world...

101
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,083
she's the dearest to me...

102
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:27,458
So I want her to be
happy no matter what.

103
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,333
Are you speaking the truth...?
We'll just have to see...

104
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,791
Farewell... we'll meet again.

105
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,041
Love you...

106
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,541
This... this is just like
the other time... isn't it?

107
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh, Karasuma...

108
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,166
It's not what you think!
I can explain!

109
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,291
You talked in your sleep
and went... Doowah...! See?

110
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,166
Doowah?

111
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,166
Yeah! It's true!

112
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,875
Then you put me
in a full nelson!

113
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
What...? You're lying...!

114
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:28,000
That's crazy, no way would I do
that, you're outta your mind!

115
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,916
No! I swear to you!

116
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,333
Oh, now hold on...
wait a second...

117
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,166
I remember something...

118
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,250
Something like this
has happened before...

119
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,458
It was when... was when...

120
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,791
I remember!

121
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,625
I can't believe it...!
You were that pervert!

122
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:01,750
Well, weren't you...?
Come on, admit it!

123
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,125
Yes... you're right.

124
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,166
It's time I told
you the truth...

125
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,416
I'm sorry for hiding
it up until now.

126
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,875
I'm the pervert from before.

127
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:12,958
I knew it!

128
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,125
No... wait...

129
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,875
I mean, yes I am the
pervert from before,

130
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,125
but I'm not really a pervert,
if you get my drift...

131
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,833
that was a misunderstanding!

132
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,041
Ha! Gimme a break!

133
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,875
No, please...!
You gotta listen...!

134
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,333
I know that anything
I say at this point

135
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,250
is just gonna sound
like an excuse, but...

136
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,875
But I... I wasn't
hiding my identity

137
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,708
from you for
the reason you think...

138
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,375
it wasn't because of guilt...

139
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,083
It was... it was
for another reason.

140
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,708
Another reason?

141
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,375
Yes... you see I...

142
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,000
I wanted to be near you...

143
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,250
Damn it, what is it now?

144
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, go ahead.

145
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,041
Hello, Tazawa? How's it coming?

146
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,625
Just fine!

147
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,791
I'm begging you here...

148
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,250
I'm staying up all
night waiting for you!

149
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,166
By the way, did you hear...?
There's been a big to-do...!

150
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,750
The word is Nijo's been
all scarred and maimed!

151
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,750
The whole company's
been buzzing about it...!

152
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,333
What a shock, huh?

153
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:13,833
Anyway... good luck
with your manuscript! Bye!

154
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,666
Did something happen?

155
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,291
Uh... no... it's nothing.

156
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,625
Oh, Karasuma...

157
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,958
No... it's not nothing!

158
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:32,083
Listen... now, try
to stay calm... but, uh...

159
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,875
It's Karasuma...
something's happened...

160
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,416
Come on, get up.

161
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,166
Let's go find him.

162
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,250
I can't believe
this is happening...

163
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,666
I was just about to tell
her the truth... and now...

164
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,875
What will I do...? What will
I do if Karasuma is...?

165
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,916
Don't cry, Tenma...!
Tears don't suit you!

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,041
It'll be okay,
don't worry...! Really!

167
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,083
I'm sure he'll be just fine!

168
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,333
Karasuma! If you make
Tenma cry any more than this,

169
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,750
I'll make you pay for it!

170
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,583
Hang on...! I'm speeding up!

171
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,541
Hey, Sis... are you okay?

172
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,291
What... happened...? Where am I?

173
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,916
Harima called and said
you were in an accident...

174
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,208
Thank goodness
it's only a scratch.

175
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,791
Where's Karasuma?

176
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm right here.

177
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,000
Miss Tsukamoto...
are you all right?

178
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,750
Ka... Karasuma!

179
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,875
You idiot... dashing off
in a storm like that...?

180
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,083
I don't know what
you were thinking

181
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,500
to do such a stupid thing!

182
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,875
Aw, shut up...!

183
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,500
I wouldn't have done it
but I didn't have a choice!

184
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,541
Damn it!

185
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,583
I can't stop!

186
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,916
Tenma!

187
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,000
Well... at least we managed to
have a safe landing...

188
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
Well, still... getting
hit by a truck again...

189
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,541
and surviving is pretty lucky...

190
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,750
Yeah, right...! No stupid
truck is gonna take me down!

191
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,791
See, I know their weakness.

192
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,791
I will admit I admire your
fight, if not your brains.

193
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,500
Whatever... anyway,
I know Tenma is safe.

194
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,916
I just remembered... Karasuma...

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,291
Oh no, he's fine...

196
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,041
in fact he's in there
with her right now.

197
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,625
Oh, cool... good for him.

198
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,041
So this is how my love ends...

199
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,625
be happy... Tenma...

200
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,666
Oh, Karasuma, thank
goodness you're alive...

201
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,250
I can't believe it!

202
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm glad to see you're
in such good spirits.

203
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,041
But... Wait a sec,
I thought you'd been...

204
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,750
all scarred and maimed...

205
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,125
Well, no...not quite.

206
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,250
I was at an all-star
game... I met Zico.

207
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,625
Shouldn't you be going
to school or something...?

208
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:02,000
Good grief... you're absolutely
hopeless when it comes to love.

209
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,625
I've got nothing to
live for... I'm so finished...

210
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,833
Oh, can the melodrama

211
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,666
and get your butt to class,
why don't you?

212
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,625
No! I couldn't go back
if my life depended on it!

213
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,000
And what makes
you think it doesn't?

214
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,791
Wait, wait...! Stop...! Help!!

215
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,208
Well, this is it...
I'm through hoping for love...

216
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,041
The only reason I enrolled
here was to be with Tenma...

217
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,750
I won't miss it...

218
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,375
Hey... Harima... what
happened to the arm, big guy?

219
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,041
Uh, stuff...

220
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,791
Got into another fight, huh...?

221
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,875
Well, come on, let's hear it,
fess up, champ...! Huh?

222
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,541
You'll have to get your
kicks somewhere else.

223
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,083
Wait! Are you gonna withdraw?

224
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,500
What's up, Tenma!

225
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,791
Good morning, Tenma!

226
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,416
Good morning!

227
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,458
So how was your winter break?

228
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,541
Yeah, anything
interesting happen?

229
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,500
Gosh, what didn't happen?

230
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,666
It was a real circus...!
Oh...! Sup, Harima!

231
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,500
Hey, wait a minute!

232
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,041
Awkward.

233
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,125
What's the deal?

234
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,250
And we're off again...
that was quick.

235
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,208
Wait, why are you
running away from me?

236
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,625
It doesn't matter,
I just am, okay?!

237
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,791
I can't possibly face her now

238
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,416
that she knows
I was the pervert!

239
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,416
So Karasuma, did you
really get to meet Zico,

240
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,708
"The God of Soccer"?

241
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,166
I got his autograph, too.

242
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,583
That is totally awesome...!

243
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,000
Here, lemme get a shot
for the fans... Say cheese!

244
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,125
I wanna talk to you!

245
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,000
Whoa!

246
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,333
You mean you didn't know?

247
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,958
Yeah, January the seventh

248
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,083
was our little
Miss Karen's birthday!

249
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,625
Honestly, I had no idea...!
Though it does ring a bell...

250
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,250
Dozibiron episode 19,
"Birthday of Sorrows!

251
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,875
Monster two point
two nine!"... Am I right?

252
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,625
That's it! Way to go
on the Dozibiron trivia!

253
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,875
You disgusting little pervert!

254
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,958
Keep your eyes in your
head where they belong!

255
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,625
Hey, did you hear...?
Takano in 2-C says that Harima

256
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,958
has run off with some sexy
photos of Ms. Tae!

257
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,750
Yeah? Man, I'd like
to see those!

258
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,166
As gentlemen, I think we ought
to look into this, partner.

259
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,333
You're right, it's our duty,
and stop calling me partner.

260
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,291
When did this faceless mob
of extras start chasing me?!

261
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,625
Some nice running there!

262
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,666
Try not to let my
bare chest distract you.

263
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,791
Shut up and get the
hell outta my way!

264
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,500
Nothing's more
pathetic than a pervert

265
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,000
who takes photographs of a woman

266
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,958
without her
knowledge or consent.

267
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,166
Shove off, jerk!

268
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,666
Whoosh!

269
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,250
Wait...! Harima!

270
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,708
No...! Stay away from me!

271
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,166
Please... Tell me!

272
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,791
Why are you
avoiding me like this...?

273
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,208
You wouldn't see me
in the hospital either!

274
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,500
I couldn't bring myself
to face you...! Not now...

275
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,041
now that you know the kind
of monster that I truly am.

276
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,666
What do you mean?

277
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,416
You know, with me being...

278
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,791
Huh?

279
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,833
Hold on...
you mean you... don't...?

280
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,625
Don't what?

281
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,333
You mean you've forgotten?

282
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,333
M... my memories
before the accident

283
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,083
are really kind of hazy...

284
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,666
I get the feeling that
something happened but I...

285
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,041
Hey, it's okay...

286
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,250
it's really nothing you
gotta strain yourself over!

287
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,250
Oh, good...!
'Cause my brain bone hurt!

288
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,708
I hope your arm is doing okay.

289
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,916
Oh, well, I ...
It's no big deal!

290
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,666
They said they said they
won't even have to amputate.

291
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,250
Thanks a lot for looking out
for me during the accident.

292
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,583
I want you to
know I appreciate it.

293
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,916
Well, you know. It's whatev.

294
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,625
I hope you'll keep on
looking out for me, okay?

295
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
Yeah... sure thing.

296
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,375
Oh, yeah!

297
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,750
Here!

298
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,125
It's that "Three for the Kill"
special episode...!

299
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,916
As promised!

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,916
Let's get together again and
have some fun real soon, okay?

301
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,833
You bet! But next
time... you drive!

302
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,583
Okay, b-bye!

303
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,166
Yeah!

304
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:26,916
It's not over...!
I can still go on!

305
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,791
What happened, Tenma?

306
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,583
What's up with Whiskers?

307
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:34,000
Mmm, I don't know,
but I guess it's all settled.

308
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,625
Hey, guess what...!
It's big news...!

309
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,375
That loser Harima is
finally dropping out!

310
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,833
No I'm not.

311
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,750
Sorry!

312
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,750
And now we're
back to square one.

313
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,791
Huh?

314
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,958
Now then! This semester we have
our class excursion to England!

315
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,083
So we're gonna need to
form a planning committee.

316
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,083
Too much trouble...! Let's
divide into teams or somethin'!

317
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,583
Chicks with British
accents are so hot!

318
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,708
I've never been on
an airplane before!

319
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,708
Anarchy in the UK!

320
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,916
Okay, get a grip,
we've got lots to do!

321
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Hey!

322
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,208
There's nothing to worry about,

323
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,333
you can just leave the class
excursion committee to me!

324
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,791
He rode that kite back
from the South Pole?

325
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,125
How the hell is
that even possible?

326
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,375
My fellow classmates!

327
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,791
Our class excursion to
England lies before us!

328
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:30,125
Let's show the English just
how pansy-core they really are!

329
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,833
Somebody...!
Get me down from here!

330
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:36,958
I'm on it...! I'll punch a hole
in the kite...! Just hang on!

331
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,791
Too much, you think?

332
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,375
Bravo...! Bravo!

333
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,708
Men, we need to practice our
pillow fighting technique!

334
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,583
We gotta learn to
kick ass, pillow style!

335
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,166
Shouldn't we be
doing this at the hotel?

336
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,208
Our boys have raised
idiocy to an art!

337
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,875
Akira!

338
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,333
Come on, guys, can we
please have some order here?!

339
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,291
Now, Mai, just take it easy.

340
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,083
Tenma...

341
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,041
Karasuma, this trip
is gonna be so much fun!

342
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Mm-hm.

343
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,250
Third semester already?

344
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,333
Mm-hm.

345
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Time really
does fly, doesn't it?

346
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Mm-hm.

347
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,875
When I was a little
girl I couldn't imagine

348
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,458
what high school would be like,

349
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,541
it seemed like it was
so many years in the future.

350
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,000
Every day that passes brings
us closer to adulthood.

351
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,166
Right now our lives are
so wonderful and exciting...

352
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,416
but the future still
seems so far away,

353
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
who knows what will happen?

354
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,583
I can tell you
one thing for sure;

355
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,750
in the future we'll
still be best friends...

356
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,583
that won't change... not ever.

357
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,375
Am I right?

358
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,291
You bet.

359
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,958
Forever and ever.

360
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,416
It's so cool, Yakumo!

361
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,375
Our class excursion is
gonna be a trip to England!

362
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,625
Karasuma and I will
see UFOs at Stonehenge,

363
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll see the changing of the
guard at Buckingham Palace,

364
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,083
I'll see mummies at the
British Museum and the girls

365
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,583
and I will eat roast beef

366
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,791
and apple pie and
scones and crumpets

367
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,416
and puddings and
toast and jam and tarts!

368
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,250
It's gonna be the greatest ever!

369
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,458
Sounds like it'll be fun, Tenma!

370
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,833
That's right stare him down!

371
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,625
Hey, Daddy...

372
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,541
I don't understand why
they left this page blank.

373
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:04,708
Hmm... The blank page
is a magic page...

374
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,166
where you can
draw your own future.

375
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,041
It's magic?

376
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,708
I wonder what kind of future
you're going to draw, Yakumo.

377
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:33,375
I remember how warm
her smile was back then.

378
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,208
It's still that warm now.

379
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,625
She bought this new book for me,

380
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
even though it was so expensive.

381
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:48,000
I... I have to return this!

382
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,708
Yeah! Go get 'em, Mangoku! Woo!
