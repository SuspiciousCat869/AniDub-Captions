1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,041
Guess it's my turn now, huh?

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:16,083
Well, I'm sure you guys
probably won't believe me...

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:20,291
But I'm telling the truth.
I saw him once.

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,750
Saw who?

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,333
Wait, you don't mean...!

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,250
Yeah... Him.

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,625
The flunk out phantom!

8
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,250
Ryu Nenji...

9
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,916
Yagami High teacher,
now deceased.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,416
Legend has it his ghost
still haunts the campus,

11
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,458
and appears to failing students
to offer them a warning.

12
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,541
Woe to those who do not heed,

13
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,958
for they will surely
be held back,

14
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,291
hence he is known as:
The Flunk Out Phantom!

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,833
Hey, did you hear?

16
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,333
Yeah. Who hasn't?

17
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,666
Some guy in 2-C saw him, right?

18
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,000
Poor bastard.

19
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,166
Must really suck being
told you might flunk out.

20
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,375
Until now, I never thought
the Phantom really existed.

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,333
Be careful, man. He's real.

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,958
Phantom, Schmantom!

23
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,041
I've had perfect
attendance this semester,

24
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,750
and it's all thanks
to you, Tenma!

25
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,416
Comin' to class
every day to see you

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,916
has kept me from
skippin' school,

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so I've got nothin'
to worry about!

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,125
Do I?

29
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,916
No way!

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,291
Wait! Where'd you go, old man?!

31
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,250
This has gotta be
a mistake, right?!

32
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,583
Oh... Morning, Harima.
What's going on?

33
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,125
Uh! Yoshida! Good morning!

34
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,625
Looking for something?

35
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,833
Uh, yeah.

36
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,916
An old guy with
white hair and a crew cut.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,791
Did you see him?

38
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,000
Nope, just you and that pole.

39
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,625
And by the way, the
name's Yoshidayama.

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,375
Hey, wait...! Old guy?

41
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,833
Crew cut? You saw him,
didn't you...? You did!

42
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:33,875
The Flunk Out Phan--!

43
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,500
Shut the flunk up!

44
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,583
Why would I see him?!

45
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,458
I've got perfect
attendance, numb nuts!

46
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,208
Sorry! I was just joking!

47
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:43,416
Geez!

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,916
I must be seein' things...

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,458
But... Why would
I see somethin' like that?

50
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,291
Screw you, ghost man!

51
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,208
I got perfect attendance!
So back the hell off!

52
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,708
Wait. I forgot!

53
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,083
You can get held back
if you have low test scores.

54
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,125
Man, I am so flunked...

55
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,000
Unless I buckle down
and study harder!

56
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,541
I can't fail no matter what!

57
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,916
I gave up a whole night
of sleep to study,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,333
but if it'll keep the Flunk Out
Phantom away from me,

59
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,333
it was worth it.

60
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,750
Harima! Pass it here!

61
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,041
Oh, hey!

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,291
Imadori! Speak to me!
Are you okay?!

63
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,916
You jerk! He has
a sensitive face!

64
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,500
I don't get it...
I studied so hard...

65
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,875
Screw it. You barely slept
and your brain's fried.

66
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,750
Eat something...
you'll feel better.

67
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,875
On second thought...

68
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,458
Maybe I'll skip lunch today.

69
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,291
Hey, are you all right, Harima?

70
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,208
Uh, I'm fine...

71
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,291
Here, you can have
my lunch if you like.

72
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,375
What's the matter?

73
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
You look like you just saw a
ghost or something.

74
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,041
Stay back! Get the flunk away
from me!

75
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,208
Ow!

76
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,625
Hey, watch where you're going,
Whiskers!

77
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
Moron.

78
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,125
Aw crap! One ghost!
Two ghost! Three ghosts!

79
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,125
What the heck is
his freaking problem?

80
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,250
Beats me, but at
the rate he's running,

81
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,666
I'd say Hershey squirts...

82
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,916
Itoko! Open up! Please!

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,958
The Phantom's gonna
flunk me if I stay out here!

84
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,291
What the--?
Harima...? Hold on...

85
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,083
Oh, no...! What if the
Phantom got Itoko, too?!

86
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,083
I'll have to take her out!

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,958
Begone...! You spawn of hell!

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,833
Don't be rude...

89
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,458
I'm no spawn from hell, idiot...

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,750
And remember, at school
you call me Miss Itoko.

91
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,458
Please! You've
gotta help me, Itoko!

92
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,500
Miss Itoko, boy.

93
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:09,166
Hmm... There may be a
way to ward off Ryu Nenji...

94
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,166
"T"... "E"... Done.

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,750
Okay now, keep doing it...

96
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,583
Keep writing vocab
words all over your body,

97
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,875
and the spectre of that old
teacher should stay away...

98
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,291
You must ingrain them on your
body and your mind as well.

99
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,458
There's no more room
left to write on my body.

100
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,291
Wait, there's still
my ears... and my ass.

101
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,125
All right, everybody.

102
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,458
Clear your desks, please.

103
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,666
Time for the exam.

104
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,666
 It must've worked!

105
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,708
That flunking Phantom hasn't
reared his ugly head today...!

106
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,333
No way I'll fail!

107
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:49,000
Harima... Go wash
that off. Right now.

108
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,083
You can either do that or
I'll flunk you for cheating.

109
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,166
No, I'm not cheating,
Mr. Tani, I swear!

110
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,208
Don't make me take
this off, please!

111
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,416
Crap! I'm really gonna fail now.

112
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,166
I'm sorry, Tenma.

113
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,916
Well... Let's get
this over with then.

114
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,583
Hey, wait!

115
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,500
I know the answer to this one!

116
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,250
And this one!
That one, too! Now I get it!

117
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,958
I learned the answers
by writing them on my body!

118
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,791
You knew all along
that I'd learn them

119
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,750
that way, didn't you...?
Itoko... Thank you.

120
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,583
I'll cap your ass.

121
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,916
Yakumo! I'm home!

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,625
I'm in here, Sis.

123
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,708
Okay, next...

124
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,000
Who were the Five
Great Emperors of Rome?

125
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,416
Nerva, Trajanus, Hadrianus,
Antoninus Pius, and um...

126
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,750
oh... what's his name...?

127
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,708
That would be Marcus Aurelius.

128
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,083
You know, they say mankind

129
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,500
was at its happiest
during his reign.

130
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,625
But what sucks is when his son
Emperor Commodus came to power,

131
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,416
Rome fell into an
age of internal strife.

132
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,666
You know so much!

133
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,625
You're like so amazing, Tanaka!

134
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,958
No I'm not, I just
like history, that's all.

135
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,333
Damn that Tanaka
and his big brain.

136
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,375
Just 'cause he's so smart, it's
easy for him to get chicks...

137
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,041
Tanaka and Nagayama, huh...?

138
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,875
Have they always
been that close?

139
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,375
They have ever since the culture
festival survival game...

140
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,583
In fact, those two are trying
to get into the same college...

141
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,875
You are planning on applying

142
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,166
to the same private
college that I am, right?

143
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,083
Hey, wait, I thought we
agreed on a state university!

144
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,250
Yeah, we did, but that was

145
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,416
before I was offered
a track scholarship.

146
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,916
What...?! When?!
Why didn't you tell me!

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,208
Please don't go off to
college without me, Madoka!

148
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,291
I'm begging you!

149
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,625
Woah, Shigeo!
You're freakin' me out!

150
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,208
The corpses of failed
students shall be my walkway

151
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,250
to the world of passing.

152
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,833
Hey, check it out.

153
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,791
Whoa. Looks like he's
possessed or something.

154
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,500
He's white as a ghost, too.

155
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,958
I wonder what's eating him?

156
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,291
Heh. Harima, you douche.

157
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,125
Looking pretty scared
there, unlike me...

158
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,041
Know why?
'Cause I'm not gonna flunk!

159
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,666
I've got a surefire way
to pass all my exams

160
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
and I didn't have to cram
at the last minute like you!

161
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,375
With you held back, the position

162
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,625
of number one senior
badass will be filled by me!

163
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,333
Ryu Nenji! Please!
I'm trying my best!

164
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,958
Everybody's getting so worn out.

165
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,666
Like delicate flowers,
slowly withering away.

166
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,166
Especially Tenma.

167
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,625
How long has she been
all zombiefied like that?

168
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,791
About an hour.

169
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,458
Think she'll snap out of it?

170
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,875
I flunked.

171
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:30,500
Huh?!

172
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,833
I flunked...

173
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,166
I'm 'onna have to repeat
this year. I just know it.

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh, But that's not
even the worst part...!

175
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,583
Now, Karasuma will sail onto
the next grade without me!

176
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,083
Why am I just now
realizing this?!

177
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,833
Why do I have to
be such a ding-dong?!

178
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,333
Hey, Tenma,
just take it easy, okay?

179
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,291
I think we've only
got one solution...

180
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,500
An all-night cram
session at Tenma's house.

181
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,333
Good idea, and
it'll give us a chance

182
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,375
to get some
last-minute studying in.

183
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,166
Oh, thank you!
All of you! You're the best!

184
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,583
Hey, hey! Don't cry.

185
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,000
We're all gonna pass
this grade together, 'kay?

186
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,708
Let's do this!

187
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,458
All right, let's start
by getting a feel

188
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,208
for how much you do
know about certain subjects.

189
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,166
Tomorrow's tests are on
Japanese History and Physics...

190
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,041
I'll ask you a few
questions about both of 'em

191
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
and you answer, okay?

192
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,208
Oh yeah! Sock 'em to me!

193
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,250
We'll start with
Japanese history,

194
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,333
so what year was the Kamakura
Shogunate first established?

195
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's see... I know!

196
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,916
In 1129, they made a big
hunk-a meat that was so fine!

197
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,875
Right?

198
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,000
Maybe we should
try physics first.

199
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,250
The three points of a mechanical
lever are what, what, and what?

200
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,041
Ball point, knife point,
and needle point!

201
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,291
Enjoy being held back.

202
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,375
No, wait! Don't leave! Please!

203
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,625
Tenma,...

204
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,833
I thought you were gonna
study all day yesterday.

205
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,791
What happened?

206
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,833
Well, in the morning, I woke up.

207
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,250
Then I headed right to the
library, ready to study...

208
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,541
But I ended up falling asleep.

209
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,000
Well rested, I went home

210
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,250
and started studying
Japanese history.

211
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,666
But all that talk about shoguns

212
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,708
and samurais reminded me
that the "Three For The Kill!"

213
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,083
Mangoku special
was about to come on.

214
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,375
After watching it, I got
serious about studying...

215
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,750
But before I knew it,
I'd fallen asleep again.

216
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,041
To be honest, I don't know
if I actually did study...

217
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,875
Do you guys know if I did?

218
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,625
No, don't! Wait a second!

219
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,875
You're my best friends!

220
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,875
You can't abandon
me in my time of need!

221
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,666
Please! I need your help!

222
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,958
Somehow the three of us managed
to study without anyone's help.

223
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,000
Why can't you?

224
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,750
I get distracted!

225
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,083
Look, even if you put
your nose to the grindstone,

226
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,458
how are we supposed

227
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,458
to help you learn two
whole courses in one night?

228
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,250
Yeah... That's impossible.

229
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,458
Don't say that!
You've gotta help me!

230
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,208
I think we should
put history off for now

231
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
and just focus on physics.

232
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,125
Really? I think she has
a slightly better chance

233
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,291
to squeak by on
history than physics.

234
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,791
Yeah, but we should get the
science in while she's fresh.

235
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,791
What are your thoughts, Akira?

236
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,041
History is a little
easier to cram for...

237
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,583
So it's best we
focus on physics early.

238
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,041
Well, ready to give
it a whirl, Tenma?

239
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,375
Newton's first law:
An object at rest tends...

240
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,250
Guess that pretty much
covers physics, huh?

241
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,416
Dear god, I hope so.

242
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,083
See what can happen
when you apply yourself?

243
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,500
Nice job!

244
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,958
Is she all right?!

245
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,041
She's going into
super cram session shock!

246
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,583
Hurry! We can't let
her swallow her tongue!

247
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,208
Everybody calm down.

248
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,125
Well, it does look
like she's doing better.

249
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,708
Too bad I can't say
the same thing about us.

250
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,500
Shake it off. We still
have history to tackle.

251
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,333
That would be nice, but...

252
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,083
if we cram anything else
in there, she might pop.

253
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:49,958
That's true.

254
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:50,958
Wait...

255
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,458
Huh?

256
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,083
I know it's gonna sound a little
crazy, but I know a way...

257
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,666
A method so Tenma can
memorize anything perfectly.

258
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,750
Yeah? What is it?
Come on! Tell us!

259
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,166
She must...

260
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,875
Must what?

261
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,375
She must associate
all the names, dates,

262
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,625
and events to someone she loves!

263
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,375
Then she won't forget!

264
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,708
Oh really?

265
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,041
No, no, no, no, wait!

266
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,875
I'm not sayin' that
I use that technique myself!

267
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,083
I'm just sayin' that--shut up!

268
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,541
Quit looking at me like that!

269
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,583
This is why I can't
tell you two anything!

270
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,375
Mikoto...

271
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,833
All of you... Listen to me...

272
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,750
Thanks to what the three of
you have done for me tonight...

273
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,625
I'm gonna pass my tests! I will!

274
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,875
Atta girl, Tenma!
That's the spirit!

275
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,166
Guess we'd better get
started on history, then.

276
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,875
We're gonna pull an all-nighter!

277
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,208
Put on a pot of coffee, Yakumo!

278
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,625
Sis, you've finally
gotten motivated!

279
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,750
Question one!

280
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,083
Warring States period,

281
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,000
who won the five battles
of Kawanakajima...?

282
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,791
A: Shingen...? Or B: Kenshin?

283
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,416
Goodbye.

284
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,708
I can't have
either Karasuma die!

285
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,750
It's C...! A draw! Huh?

286
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,125
I did it! I'm the master!

287
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,833
Please, be quiet...!
This is a classroom!

288
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,500
At the rate I'm going,
I'll be done in no time!

289
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,625
Huh? Tenma's breezing
through this test.

290
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,625
My surefire way to pass
all my exams is copying off

291
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,000
of smart kids,
so you're it, Tenma.

292
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,500
This is like shooting
fish in a barrel!

293
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,916
Third semester, here I come!

294
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,916
Your test, Yoshidayama.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,333
Right.

296
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,375
Zero points.

297
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,416
What?!

298
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,125
How did this happen?!
Why?! Why?!

299
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:01,291
One hundred points!
See ya soon, Karasuma!

300
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,791
Ninety-nine. One more left.

301
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,625
Okay... Then I get
to tell the last one.

302
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,750
This happened
three nights ago...

303
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,500
I'd accidentally forgotten
some of my photos in my locker,

304
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,375
so I snuck back into school.

305
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,125
It was as quiet as a mausoleum.

306
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,416
I was halfway to the front
doors when I heard it...

307
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,958
I thought I was
imagining things, but then...

308
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,666
It was dark that night,
but I know what I saw.

309
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,583
It was... It was Yassie.

310
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,375
Hey... You're putting us on.

311
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,666
The Lake Yagami Beast?
Yeah right!

312
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,541
Oh, come on!

313
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,791
Even if there was such a thing,

314
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,791
there's no way it'd be
swimming in our pool!

315
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,875
You think so?

316
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,458
Let's go see, then... Right now.

317
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,041
Just like I thought.
There's nothing here...

318
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,291
Yeah. Gotta admit it was
a good last story, though.

319
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,583
I was actually a
little scared to come.

320
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,750
Me, too.

321
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,750
I guess we should
be getting back, huh?

322
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,000
Uh-huh.

323
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,375
Well, I think we've finally got

324
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,625
that chlorine smell out
of your coat, Pyotr.

325
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,375
I know you wanted to see Yakumo,

326
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,708
but you can't run away
from the zoo like that.

327
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,791
'Kay...! Ya hear?!

328
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,000
Really? That must have
been pretty awkward.

329
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,666
It did freak me out a little.

330
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,708
I was watching the
"Three For The Kill" special,

331
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,541
and all of a sudden, there's
this giraffe sitting next to me!

332
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,541
A giraffe...? Awesome.

333
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,833
Too bad he's not here now...

334
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,166
He could join our pajama party.

335
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,833
I'm so glad exams are over.

336
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,541
Now we can finally sleep.

337
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,541
None of us are
sleeping tonight...

338
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,750
At least, not until Mikoto
finally tells us what happened

339
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,041
What? What do you mean?

340
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
Don't play dumb
with us. You know.

341
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,875
The date you made

342
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,083
with Asou during the
basketball sendoff party.

343
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,208
We want all the details,

344
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,125
so don't you dare
leave anything out.

345
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,041
We went shopping.
That's it. End of story.

346
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,291
Uh-uh! That's not
going to work this time!

347
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,416
So spill it!

348
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,291
If you ask me, Miko,
Asou iss totally into you!

349
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,375
Oh yeah!

350
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,500
This conversation is over!

351
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,083
Don't you think
he's a little shy

352
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,541
when it comes to girls, though?

353
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,375
Yeah, but I get the
feeling all it would take

354
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,375
to get Asou out of his shell
would be a girl like Mikoto.

355
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,250
Well, talk!

356
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,750
We want the details!

357
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,250
Kay. The truth is...

358
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,208
The two of us really
did go shopping.

359
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,125
Yeah?! Well, what happened?!

360
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,375
That sucks, they're closed.

361
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,250
Guess I shoulda
called first, huh?

362
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,666
Man, this bites.

363
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,333
I really wanted
to get those shoes.

364
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,916
Why don't we try another store?

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,166
Can't. This is the only place

366
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,666
that carries the
brand I wanted...

367
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,166
Oh well, I suppose
I'll just have to come back

368
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,625
another time when
they're open... But hey...

369
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,291
As long as we're out,

370
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,458
why don't we go grab
a burger or something?

371
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,458
Uh... I'm, uh...

372
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,416
not really hungry,
but I could go for some tea.

373
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,833
Lies!

374
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,333
What?!

375
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,833
"Not hungry?" You can normally
put away two Was Burgers.

376
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,291
Oh please...! It's more
like four and a half!

377
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,166
And then there's
always the apple pie.

378
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,375
Well, well...

379
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,208
Asou's not the only
shy person we know...

380
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,750
So what happened next?

381
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,333
We sat down...

382
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,000
Hey, um, do you have
any plans after this?

383
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,083
After this?

384
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,916
No, I mean, not really,
why do you ask?

385
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,625
There's this place
I'd like to swing by

386
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,791
if that's okay with you.

387
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,166
Uh, sure.

388
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,500
That's it.

389
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,625
So you read
about basketball, too?

390
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,500
Yeah. What kinda
stuff do you read about?

391
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:30,791
Huh?! Me? I, um... I'm into...

392
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,166
Romantic stuff, like true love.

393
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,041
All lies!

394
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,166
No! You didn't actually
tell him that, did you?!

395
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,958
Well, yeah?

396
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,125
True love?!

397
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,333
All you ever read
about is combat sports!

398
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,166
If you read anything else,
you fall asleep in ten minutes.

399
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,041
I do not!

400
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,458
I just like to... rest my eyes.

401
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,500
What happened next?

402
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,000
Where did you lovebirds go?

403
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Not that it's any
of your business...

404
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,625
We went and did karaoke!

405
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,375
Whoa. I never knew
Asou liked to sing.

406
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,791
All right. Your turn, Suou.

407
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,250
Huh?

408
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,166
Uh... Yeah, about that,

409
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,541
I think I only know
like one of these songs.

410
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,208
Which one?

411
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,125
"Butterfly?", huh...?

412
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,833
Never heard of it.
Is it an import?

413
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,916
Uh, yeah! That's it!

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,791
Oh, so you like to listen
to international music? Cool.

415
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,583
Yeah, every now and then,
spice things up...

416
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,291
Full of lies!

417
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,541
Hold on.
That's not international!

418
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,708
That's Hiro Chosuke's
entrance music!

419
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,291
The pro wrestler.

420
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,458
I remember I just didn't want
him to know I liked wrestling.

421
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,250
Well, did you sing it
in front of him at least?

422
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,333
No, I couldn't do that, either.

423
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,458
Why must you be so full of lies?

424
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,000
I mean, you sing
like a rock star

425
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,708
when you do
karaoke with us.

426
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,375
Yeah, you even taught me
all those killer dance moves!

427
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,958
Oh, I gotta doo-wah! All night!

428
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,125
If you were in
front of some guy,

429
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,291
you couldn't do
it either, jerk face!

430
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,791
Okay, we're sorry, Miko...

431
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,375
We were just hoping that
you'd have a love connection...

432
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,541
What happened next?

433
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,166
We ended up going to the arcade.

434
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,958
Really? Did you go
in the photo booth?

435
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,625
Hey, let's go over there.

436
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,291
Sure, but why?

437
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,958
They have better
games over there!

438
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,375
What?

439
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,250
You actually pulled him away...?
Why would you do that?

440
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,083
Yeah, especially since you
have the high score on it.

441
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,291
Didn't you say that the next
time you were at the arcade,

442
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,791
you wanted to
beat your own record?

443
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,958
Guys, will you give me a break?

444
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,416
Fine, so then what happened?

445
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Um, let's see...

446
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,291
Asou saw a racing game
he wanted to play.

447
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,250
Wow.

448
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,958
I never knew you
liked videogames.

449
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,541
Surprised, huh?

450
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,750
Yeah, I thought the only thing
you were into was basketball.

451
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,166
There's more to me than that.

452
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,083
Like right now...

453
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,166
I'd much rather
be hanging out here

454
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,666
with you than
playing basketball.

455
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,291
You should've kept your
eyes on the road, you dork.

456
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,458
Can you do better,
Miss Backseat Driver?

457
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,208
Well, you're about to
find out, future loser.

458
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,125
I was thinking that maybe
after graduation, I'd buy a car.

459
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,000
Really?

460
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah.

461
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,625
That way I could travel around
whenever I wanted, y'know?

462
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,833
Go see places
I've never seen before.

463
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,416
You're about to see
another wreck happen

464
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,125
if you don't pay more attention.

465
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:17,083
Come on... Gimme a break,
Mikoto. It's just...

466
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:17,958
Huh?

467
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,458
It's just weird that graduation

468
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,458
is a little more than
a year from now...

469
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:25,541
You and me... Everybody else.
What's going to happen to us?

470
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,958
And...?!

471
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,541
Yeah, what happened next?

472
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,666
Did you lose on purpose so Asou
wouldn't know how good you are?

473
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,666
Uh, well actually...

474
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,791
I beat him. And I set
a new speed record.

475
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,541
All right!

476
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,375
I'm sorry, sir, but could
you leave? We're closing.

477
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,500
Cheers, Tenma! Happy Birthday!
