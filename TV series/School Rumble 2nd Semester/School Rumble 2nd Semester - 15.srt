1
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,500
Yo, Karasuma!

2
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,750
I hope you enjoyed
Tenma's party...

3
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,541
Heard it was a real
jamboree. But anyway...

4
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:21,041
Don't worry.

5
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:23,750
I was able to take care of
the comic all by my lonesome.

6
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,166
No need to thank me... See ya!

7
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,750
And by take care of it I mean...

8
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,708
I just turned in
my own drawings.

9
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:34,250
God, I hope this turns out okay!

10
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:37,416
What...?! It...
it isn't possible!

11
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,583
Remember how I messed
up Karasuma's pages

12
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,083
and switched 'em with mine?

13
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:23,000
Take a look.

14
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:26,000
For some reason they went
ahead and ran my pages...

15
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,458
but put my penname
on it instead!

16
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,125
Wow! You're going to
Taiwan for winter break?!

17
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:35,166
You suck! I'll be playing
bingo with my Grandma.

18
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,250
Hey... did you see
this new comic...?

19
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:40,375
Weak art but... the story...

20
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,000
Lemme see, lemme see...

21
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,375
Oh, I read that!

22
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,791
It's sort of a-typical
for a comic, huh?

23
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:48,291
Hario Harima, right?
I read that too.

24
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:53,583
The author is standing
right next to ya...!

25
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,916
And what do you mean
"weak art", Suou?

26
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,500
I don't know...

27
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,333
I think the whole
story is kinda stupid.

28
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:01,291
He totally oversimplifies love.

29
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,041
Everybody's a critic!

30
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,208
Yeah, but... I like
that it's so simple...

31
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:08,541
I can't follow those
complicated epics.

32
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:10,208
Mmhm-mmhm...

33
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:13,166
clearly, Suou is a connoisseur.

34
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,500
When I'm famous
I'll give you my autograph.

35
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,375
Gimme a break, a boy and a girl
don't just suddenly fall in love

36
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,625
and move in together
like that! Please!

37
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,583
They think just because
it's a comic book

38
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,875
they can get away
with anything...!

39
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,583
I mean seriously,
it's so insulting!

40
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:31,250
Rich Girl, you
empty shell of a woman.

41
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:35,666
Don't you know what
love is?! I pity you.

42
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,458
And what's your opinion, Tenma?

43
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,750
Whoa! That's a good question!

44
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:44,541
Takano, when I'm famous
I'll give you two autographs!

45
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,125
You wanna know what I think?

46
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,083
Yeah.

47
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,208
Okay... I'm ready...
I can handle this...

48
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,333
Plunge the blade of
criticism into my heart!

49
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,583
I guess it was okay...

50
01:03:58,666 --> 01:03:59,750
I thought it was kind
of neat that it was

51
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,500
so dreamy and romantic.

52
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:05,625
It makes me wish something
like that would happen to me!

53
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:11,500
Yes!! I'm so lucky to be
the author...! I knew it!

54
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:14,458
I knew you'd love it, Tenma!

55
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:21,250
All right!!!

56
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:24,916
Congratulations!

57
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,416
That was a very entertaining
story, Tazawa...!

58
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,666
The feedback we've gotten

59
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,541
from the readers has
been really positive...!

60
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:31,458
Yes...! I'll work even harder...

61
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:33,833
and make Tenma even happier!

62
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,083
Hey!

63
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:37,916
Who's that girl behind you?

64
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,125
I'm his assistant, sir.
Yakumo Tsukamoto.

65
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,291
She helped with the layout,

66
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:45,083
so I brought her along...
is that okay?

67
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,666
I guess...

68
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,083
Hey, Chief... this is Tazawa.

69
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:08,458
Actually, my... my... my name--

70
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,000
Never mind, it's cool...

71
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:13,083
Wait! Hold on...!
What're you doing?

72
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,375
Don't get too close!

73
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:17,166
So... you're the head editor?

74
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,083
Do you enjoy scaring
new comic book artists,

75
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,208
or is that just
part of your job?

76
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,708
Is she out of her mind?

77
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:27,041
She'll get herself killed!

78
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,958
You're the first
person I've ever seen

79
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:37,625
who didn't fall to
the ground in terror.

80
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,291
It's a pleasure
to meet you, miss.

81
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,166
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

82
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,625
That's the first time the
boss has smiled in 20 years!

83
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,791
No, thirty!

84
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,708
So, I understand
you know the captain

85
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,750
of The Cry of the
Demon... don't you?

86
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:09,000
Um... while I... was...
I was on that ship...

87
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,833
And the captain gave me
this pen--don't hurt me!

88
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:15,416
Draw me a hundred and
twenty pages by next week.

89
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,458
This is bad! This is really bad!

90
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:27,958
A hundred and twenty pages?!

91
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,833
So much for enjoying
my winter break!

92
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:32,708
I'll have to lock myself up in
my room and work the whole time!

93
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,750
Hey, Itoko, I'm home!

94
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:43,125
Sheesh...! Well, at least
I'll be able to work in peace,

95
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,458
so that's all right.

96
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,625
You're kidding, she locked
the door when she left!

97
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:51,083
Calm down, Harima, all you
have to do is use your key.

98
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,583
Don't have it.

99
01:06:52,666 --> 01:06:53,666
What?

100
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,166
I'm sorry, Sis.

101
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,083
Just for a while,
during the break.

102
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:06,250
I told Harima it would be all
right if he stayed here with us.

103
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,625
I'm really sorry, Sis...

104
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:15,166
it's just for a while,
during the winter break.

105
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,875
I told Harima it would be
all right if he stayed here.

106
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,083
Rowf!

107
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,375
Talk about a weird dream!

108
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,541
All of a sudden
I'm staying at Tenma's house?

109
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:31,375
I knew it was too good
to be true! Dammit!

110
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,666
But when did the dream
start...? Itoko's trip...?

111
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,958
The editor in chief?

112
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,083
What if I just dreamed that they

113
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:43,125
published my comic
instead of Karasuma's?

114
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,666
Where am I?

115
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,625
Hey, Harima...! Are you up yet?

116
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,541
It's not a dream!

117
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,291
Oh, Harima...?

118
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:00,000
Is this enough, or would
you like a bigger bowl?

119
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,083
You're so lucky, Yakumo's
cooking is the best ever!

120
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,458
Better dig in
before I eat it all!

121
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,666
Aw yeah! Me so
hungry for miso soup!

122
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,166
C'mon, Harima!
What's wrong? Dig in!

123
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,375
Okay...

124
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,958
Nope. It's no dream, it's real.

125
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,708
Tenma and me,
under the same roof.

126
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,791
Even better, at the same table!

127
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:30,875
Uh, let's see, soy sauce ...

128
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,041
Here.

129
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,541
This one's the soy sauce.

130
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:34,708
The little round headed guy.

131
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,875
Oh.

132
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:36,791
Don't forget, if there's
anything you need

133
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,958
or want, you just ask, okay?

134
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,375
I never thought
I could be this happy!

135
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:47,000
The road to the top is truly
paved in the sweetness of life!

136
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,375
Hey, can I lend a hand?

137
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:53,583
Sure, if you want...

138
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,458
Would you mind putting
those dry dishes up

139
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:57,291
on the first shelf of
the cupboard for me?

140
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,833
No, not at all.

141
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,250
Uh, is this where
they're supposed to go?

142
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,208
Yes, thank you, that's perfect!

143
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:05,041
It's sure handy to have
a nice tall guy around

144
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,541
to reach the high places.

145
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,958
Yeah... I'm good at bein' tall.

146
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:11,875
Holy crap...!

147
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,250
It's almost like we're newlyweds
in our first house together!

148
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,916
Tenma, I swear, as of today...

149
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,833
no, as of this moment
I am your servant!!

150
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:22,750
Hey... Harima?

151
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,041
Huh?

152
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,666
Laundry's up next?

153
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,041
Don't worry about it,
I'll do it.

154
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,625
It's awfully nice
of you to offer,

155
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,875
but what about your manuscript?

156
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,375
...but what about
your manuscript?

157
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,083
...but what about your
manuscript?

158
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:39,083
Crap, I forgot all about it!

159
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:40,458
I've got a hundred
and twenty pages

160
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,666
of heartbreaking
genius to create!!

161
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,958
Little Kuta continues to grow,

162
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,041
and is currently
three meters tall.

163
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,958
Whoa...! Holy snap!
That's Panda Power.

164
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,375
I can't believe he grew so much.

165
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,541
Hm? Is everything okay, Harima?

166
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,666
Oh, yeah, I was just, you know,

167
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,916
lookin' for somethin' to drink.

168
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Oh...! I'm sorry, how
thoughtless of me!

169
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,291
No, it's cool! I can get it
if you tell me where it is.

170
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,833
Don't be silly!

171
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:13,625
You're our honored guest, aren't
you...? Is coffee all right?

172
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,500
Uh... okay.

173
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,166
If you'd like another
cup, just say so!

174
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,291
Uh... sure... thanks!

175
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,666
Good luck in there, Harima...

176
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,958
though I don't really
know what you're doing.

177
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:27,791
I have to admit...

178
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:28,875
I was a little surprised

179
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,125
when you brought
Harima here yesterday.

180
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,125
I'm really sorry
for the trouble, Sis.

181
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,583
Well, what could you do?

182
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:38,000
Besides, Yakumo, you hardly
ever ask me for anything.

183
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,916
If you wanna have a
guest stay over here...

184
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,708
then your Big Sister
is no problemo!

185
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,791
Thanks, Tenma.

186
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:52,541
Stupid. Stupid! Stupid!!

187
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,541
That's so lame.

188
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,541
Did Harima really say
he was gonna skip lunch?

189
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,500
Yeah... He said he needed
to stay focused right now.

190
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,041
Wait a minute, focused?

191
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:04,500
Oh, right, on that whole project
thing I know nothing about.

192
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:10,458
Harima's not even gonna
have a snack with us?

193
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,166
I'd better go see
how he's doing.

194
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,708
Way to go, future housewife!

195
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:16,208
Come on, Sis,
it's not like that!

196
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,083
Still it does feel
a little strange...

197
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,333
Right... Iori?

198
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,000
Hello, Harima?

199
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,083
I'm coming in now, all right?

200
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,500
You okay...? Is the
manuscript going well?

201
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,000
He looks like Dad...

202
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,875
Would you like to take a
little break for a while?

203
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,458
I can't!!

204
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:49,875
The genius... It won't flow!

205
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,750
I know... the scene
I wanna draw...

206
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,750
but for some reason I just
can't get the composition right!

207
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:58,041
Uh, if you like,
I could pose for you,

208
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,166
if you think that would help.

209
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,916
You mean it...? You'd do that?

210
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,750
Yeah... of course.

211
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,666
It's estimated that
Little Kuta grows as much as

212
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,916
ten centimeters every day.

213
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,791
That's too much...

214
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:17,041
I need to start getting
dinner ready soon...

215
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:21,833
but I think I'm really helping
Harima make some progress...

216
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:25,625
so... maybe just
a little longer.

217
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,541
We've been told by his
keeper that little Kuta

218
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:31,041
ate a bucket of
seventy-seven fish today...

219
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,208
Let's just hope his taste

220
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:33,833
for flesh doesn't
cross over into humans.

221
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,458
That's right, eat some more...

222
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,208
Hey! Whatsit?!

223
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:40,750
Thanks a lot, Tenma's Sister...!

224
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,625
Uh, oh... no ink.

225
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,958
Would you like me
to go buy some?

226
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,458
Are you sure it's no trouble?

227
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,500
No, I have to go out anyway.

228
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:52,791
If it's no big deal,
then, thanks.

229
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:54,250
Of course.

230
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,791
Oh, man, I'm so hungry I think

231
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:59,958
my freakin' stomach's
eating itself... what the...?

232
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,250
Yakumo, you tryin' to starve me?

233
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:05,708
Sorry, Sis... I'm a little
late with dinner tonight.

234
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,958
Oh, that's okay!

235
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:11,458
I know how it is with you
newlyweds! All lovey-dovey!

236
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,458
I told you it's not like that!

237
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:21,500
So cold... what a chilly
night... it's really winter now.

238
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:25,750
I'm back!

239
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,833
I know I'm awfully late...

240
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:30,583
You're kidding! Really?

241
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,000
You're so funny, Harima...!

242
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,125
Why don't you
just join our family?

243
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:39,000
Really?!

244
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,250
You could be our little brother!

245
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,000
Or distant cousin!
Or, whatever...

246
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:45,458
But just remember, the remote
control is mine pretty much

247
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,583
whenever I want, got it, Kenji?

248
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,458
She called me Kenji!

249
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,875
He looks so happy...

250
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:56,416
Hey, Yakumo, you're back!

251
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,791
Well then...

252
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:00,208
I'll get out of your way
so you can get back to it...

253
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,916
Of course I still
don't have any idea

254
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,083
what it is that you're doing...

255
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,708
Um... here's your ink.

256
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:10,458
Oh...! Uh, thanks a lot!

257
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,166
That's all right,
it's no big deal...

258
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:14,041
Man, I feel great!

259
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,916
It's like... I have
all this motivation...!

260
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,208
I'll draw a hundred and
twenty pages, no sweat!

261
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:20,750
Hell, I'll draw a
hundred and fifty!

262
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:23,166
To the fields of glory!!

263
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:29,541
Excuse me, Miss.

264
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,416
I was wondering if you'd
made your decision yet.

265
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,750
Are you kidding?

266
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:36,833
It's not like it's really
my decision, now, is it?

267
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:39,166
Mother wants me to do this.

268
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,958
I have no choice.

269
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,541
Not that it matters.

270
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,791
No one will even
notice I'm gone.

271
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,125
I wish there was some other way

272
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,291
I could help Harima,
if only just a little.

273
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,791
Iori, what are you
playing with...? A flyer?

274
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,000
Comic book editors' school?

275
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:11,083
Thank you very much for
coming here today, everybody.

276
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:13,041
Here we go...

277
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:15,583
Allow me to introduce
today's speaker...

278
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:18,083
a former fisherman and
currently editor in chief

279
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:22,250
for Weekly Shonen
Zinegama... Mr. Gotou!!

280
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:30,708
You must draw every
moment of the day!

281
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:32,291
I don't care if
you're hospitalized

282
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:35,750
or if your life is
falling apart! Draw!!

283
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,916
So you're back again, are ya?

284
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,791
Whadda ya say?

285
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,916
Once you get out of school,

286
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,333
how about joining
our editorial staff?

287
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,041
I can't believe it.

288
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:56,125
He gave me a
certification badge.

289
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:59,125
But I didn't really
understand his lecture...

290
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,833
Harima and Yakumo
are so cute together

291
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:08,958
it just makes me wanna
punch somebody in the face!

292
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,375
Oh, man, love is the
greatest thing ever!

293
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,500
Maybe I ought to do a
little bit of research

294
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,208
to make sure he's
good enough for her!

295
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:18,541
With my help, Yakumo's
love life is gonna shine!

296
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,208
Okay.

297
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,708
Since my love life's a
little less than perfect,

298
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,416
I'll ask everyone else what
they think makes a good man.

299
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,750
All right, that's sent off.

300
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:27,750
Now!

301
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,041
I can't trust that
he'll be honest,

302
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,958
not if he knows that it's me.

303
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,875
I need a disguise!

304
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,208
Whoa, that was quick!

305
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:39,000
Another one?

306
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,916
Man, I'm blowin' up over here!

307
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,458
Excuse me, Harima?

308
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,916
C'mon, Sis, it's not like that!

309
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,125
Yes! Perfect!

310
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,333
Iori, come here!

311
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:01,041
Are you feeling okay, Tenma?

312
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:05,625
No, no, no...!
Hmph. I'm Yakumo.

313
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,458
Huh?!

314
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:09,500
I'll start with Eri's text.

315
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,125
A man should be able
to see the subtle changes

316
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,291
in a woman... or else forget it!

317
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,000
Roger!

318
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,750
Hey Harima!

319
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,125
I mean, excuse me,
but can I ask you a question?

320
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:24,083
Uh... sure, I suppose...

321
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:27,208
Do you think there's anything
different about me today?

322
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,708
Uh, yeah, I'll say...

323
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:31,666
What's with the hair
and the clothes?

324
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,083
Yes! First checkpoint clear!

325
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,750
Okay, what's next?

326
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,291
Lemme see...

327
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,541
I guess I'd be happy if he ate
whatever I prepared for him

328
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,208
without complaining about it.

329
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,125
Have I mentioned how
uncomfortable these things are?

330
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,125
I can believe that.

331
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,250
Probably give
you a backache too.

332
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,166
Okay! Here's Yakumo's curry...

333
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,125
Oww! Let's spice it up!

334
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:56,333
We'll see if he can stand this!

335
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,958
Here you go, Harima!

336
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,166
Now I wanna see
you clean your plate!

337
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,875
Tenma's cooking!

338
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:08,375
This could be intense,
but I'll do it!

339
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,791
Wait... that's pretty good!

340
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:13,041
Oh, my gosh!

341
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,583
The spiciness doesn't
bother him...! He loves it!

342
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,916
And he ate the whole thing!

343
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,708
Second checkpoint, clear!

344
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:22,625
And next...

345
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,750
Gosh... this question
is so sudden...

346
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,625
I guess what I'd
like most is a man

347
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:30,916
who'd be able to protect me
in a pinch... yeah, that's it!

348
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,333
That's a good one...

349
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:35,041
You're a genius, Carolyn!

350
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,958
Now... what to do...

351
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:40,250
What the heck is up
with Tenma today?

352
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:43,125
Could it be?

353
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:45,583
Now that I think of it, I've
been so wrapped up in my work,

354
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:48,375
the only person I've spoken
to is her little sister!

355
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,750
So Tenma dressed up like Yakumo
so I'd pay attention to her!

356
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,708
How could I let
it come to this?!

357
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:56,333
Okay, from now on my whole body

358
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,875
and soul are focused on her!

359
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,416
Ahh! Harima!

360
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,166
What is it?!
I'm here for you, baby!

361
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,500
Tell me what to do!!

362
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,041
There's a cockroach, get it!

363
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:09,041
Don't worry, I'm all over it...

364
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:14,875
No, I just can't
hit the nice kitty...

365
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:16,875
Oh, no!

366
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,166
Has Harima failed
the third checkpoint?

367
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,291
Wait a sec, Carolyn's email
has another part to it!

368
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,500
On the other hand, I don't
think I'd want someone

369
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,541
who solved all his
problems with brute force...

370
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:29,625
I'd like someone who was
kind as well as strong.

371
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:32,041
It's a complete turnabout...!

372
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,000
Third checkpoint clear!

373
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,500
Okay, it's time
for Megumi's text!

374
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:39,125
If he looks hot,
that's all that matters.

375
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,208
Oh, Harima!

376
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:45,250
Oh, god, what is it this time?

377
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,666
Gimmie!

378
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,500
Oh, wow! You're actually--

379
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:51,750
Hold on.

380
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,333
There's something strangely
familiar about your face.

381
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:55,416
Give those back!

382
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,375
Hey now, come on!

383
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,708
Lemme have another look!

384
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,958
Sorry, it's too bright
in here, I need my shades!

385
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:01,500
Man, that was close!

386
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,875
If she remembered who I was
she'd never speak to me again!

387
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,875
Well, if he never
takes his sunglasses off,

388
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,291
it doesn't really matter!

389
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,208
We'll just call that one a pass!

390
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:10,875
Moving on to Akira!

391
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,416
Money.

392
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,666
Lend me some money!

393
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,541
Sure!

394
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,750
Take it all!

395
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,291
Twelve yen?

396
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:25,833
It's more than I have... Pass!

397
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:27,791
You're the perfect man!

398
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:30,458
The one I've been waiting for!

399
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:33,333
At last!
You and I can finally...

400
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:35,958
You and Yakumo will
live happily ever after!

401
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,083
Her big sister is satisfied!

402
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,125
Now make sure you
don't take things too fast

403
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,333
when you're dating!

404
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,791
Shaka-boom!

405
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,125
Hello? Anyone home?

406
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:52,000
Welcome back, you lucky girl!

407
01:20:52,083 --> 01:20:56,333
Oh no... Tenma still thinks
I'm seeing her little sister...

408
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,125
I've gotta stop this...!

409
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,916
I've gotta spell things out for
her or we'll never get together!

410
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:17,500
Tonight... I'll tell
her everything!

411
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:19,916
There's no mistakin' that hair.

412
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,750
Listen... I'm sorry to
bother you so late...

413
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,625
I wanted to do this sooner,
but I wasn't brave enough...

414
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:28,958
So tonight I'm just
gonna plunge right in...

415
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:33,041
I... I've always
wanted to tell you, I...

416
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,916
I love you my darling!!!

417
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:43,458
Iori...?! Then this must
be Tenma's Sister's room!

418
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,500
Little Kuta has
eaten a lot today, too,

419
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:24,375
and it looks like
he's still growing!

420
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,541
I forbid you to go near Yakumo!

421
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:00,333
Next time on School Rumble!

422
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:02,125
"I Don't Want to
Be Tied to Anyone;

423
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:04,291
I Don't Want to Go to
School or Home Anymore;

424
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,208
Under the Dark Veil of Night."

425
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,666
Harima, you're just
still an ape, aren't you?
