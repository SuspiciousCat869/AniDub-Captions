1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,500
For many years, I have
sought this enchanted land!

2
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,916
Has my quest finally
come to an end?

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Within that sheer, soaring
tower lies the princess!

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,916
Master, I beg you...
don't do this...!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,291
No one who has ever entered

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,500
that mystic tower has
returned to tell the tales!

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,625
Silence...!
It's my destiny to go on!

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,250
Inside that tower the princess,

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,666
placed under a curse
by an evil witch, has lain

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,541
in enchanted slumber
for a hundred years!

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,541
Now... to the tower!

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,416
You see, it's an epic love story

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,791
and a sweeping
fantasy all in one...!

14
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,083
What do you think?

15
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,583
You know...

16
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,625
I had so much energy after
seeing your sister yesterday...

17
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,541
I stayed up the
whole night drawing

18
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,041
this one hundred and
twenty page masterpiece!

19
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,375
I hate to spring
it on you like this,

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,000
but could you read it
and give me your feedback?

21
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,583
Man, I'm beat.

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,166
I need some shut-eye, like whoa.

23
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,333
Have you heard?

24
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,208
2-C's play is supposed
to be incredible!

25
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,416
Yeah, I heard the casting
was, like, phenomenal!

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,958
It figures...

27
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,916
I mean, Takano has always been,
like, so creative, you know?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,750
Yeah, I wonder
who's playing what role!

29
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,458
I'm so excited I can't stand it!

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,750
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

31
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,750
Yeah! That is one hot poster!

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,375
Know what I mean? Low five.

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Wow, the place
is really filling up!

34
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,083
It looks like we
got a full house, guys!

35
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,500
Imagine having all these people
turn out to see our little play!

36
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,916
Sawachika's a knockout!

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,916
You look great, Eri!

38
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,833
No doubt about it, all
eyes are gonna be on her!

39
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:31,916
Okay, so seriously...

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,375
You're rockin' that
outfit to the max!

41
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,041
Well, I don't feel
rockin'... I'm shaking!

42
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,333
Don't sweat it... We've
rehearsed this thing to death!

43
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,333
I guess so.

44
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,625
Once upon a time,
in a far off land,

45
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,625
there was a beautiful
princess who was placed

46
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,291
under a curse by an evil witch.

47
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,833
For a hundred years she lay deep

48
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,666
in an enchanted sleep
in a soaring tower.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,000
But now, six brave heroes
have gathered together

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,916
in order to rescue the princess!

51
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,125
Six heroes give their call...

52
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,333
all for one and one for all!

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,833
The six brave heroes...

54
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
traveled across six valleys
and climbed six mountains

55
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,166
until they finally arrived
at a mighty forest of thorns

56
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,750
at the base of the tower.

57
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,583
Halt...! Who gave you permission
to enter this forbidden land?

58
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,416
Stand aside now, unless you
wish to be cut down on the spot!

59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Brave talk, traveler,
but first you must defeat

60
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,666
the three swimsuit
sumo musketeers

61
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,708
if you wish to proceed
on your journey!

62
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,875
Prepare... to face the awesome
power of Ganji the mighty!

63
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
Can we get by?

64
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,916
Oh, yes, absolutely!

65
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,916
Our goal is within sight...!
There lies the princess!

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,125
Now, that's the cue...!
Get going!

67
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,750
What can we do...? Those
thorns are protecting the gate!

68
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,958
They grow back as
fast as we cut them!

69
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,083
What's this...?
The thorns just moved!

70
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,458
Oh... oh, no!

71
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,041
The thorns must be under
some sort of curse as well!

72
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,958
I call on the spirits of good,
to dispel this evil magic!

73
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,875
You rock, Eri!

74
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,916
My princess... I swear
I will soon be at your side!

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,125
Yeah, Sawachika!

76
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,500
Hey...!It's just about
time for the bed scene!

77
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,708
Okay! Come on,
guys, give me a hand!

78
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,791
Right!

79
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,958
Uh-oh.

80
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,166
I have to wake up Harima!

81
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,291
Harima!

82
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,875
You've got to get up!

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,458
Here goes!

84
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,750
One, two...

85
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,458
At last the six
reached the topmost room

86
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,666
of the tower and
beheld the princess...

87
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,416
She laid before them
unchanged for a century,

88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,375
resting in her
enchanted slumber,

89
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,041
her beauty undimmed
by the passage of years.

90
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,125
What is Harima doing up there?

91
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,458
Suou was supposed
to be the princess!

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,291
Hey... we've been ripped off!

93
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,000
You guys just
don't understand art.

94
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,000
Say what?

95
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,625
It's traditional to
have a woman play

96
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,458
a male role in these plays...
but to turn it around like this

97
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,500
and then not even put the
guy in a female costume...

98
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,666
...well, you don't even see that
kind of avant garde technique

99
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,958
in a Broadway play...
right... partner?

100
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,625
Don't call me partner.

101
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,166
Impressive, 2-C...

102
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,041
looks like we're really going
to have to stay on our toes.

103
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,458
Right, Lara?

104
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
Hey, what the heck
happened to Mikoto?!

105
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,333
It's true, we're putting
on a class play today

106
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,875
and I'm Sleeping Beauty!

107
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,333
Right... trying to
trick me again, eh...?

108
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,166
What is it this time, some kinda
fantasy princess coffeehouse?

109
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,416
Huh...? Now what should we do?

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,833
You're kidding!

111
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,875
Hey... the director says
to just keep it moving along!

112
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,291
Hmm... The show must go on...

113
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,833
We have no choice!

114
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,291
But... but if we keep going,
that means I'll... have to...

115
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,875
Good luck, prince!

116
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,416
Everybody's watching...

117
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,375
What... do we...

118
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,125
what do we do to waken the
princess from her slumber?

119
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,833
The first thing you must
do is defeat the evil witch

120
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,958
who placed the
princess under this spell!

121
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,416
Wait! Who are you?

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,208
We're the spirits of the sword!

123
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,666
No witch in the world
can withstand the power

124
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
of this magic sword!

125
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,333
But before we can
give it to you,

126
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,208
you must prove yourselves worthy
of bearing this mighty weapon!

127
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,416
You must pass
the test of wisdom!

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,375
A test?

129
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,416
This is your question...

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,250
Tell me now, hero, what
has four legs in the morning,

131
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,458
two legs in the afternoon,
and three legs... at night?

132
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,208
I know!

133
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,708
That's such an easy one!

134
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:25,500
The answer is... a monster!

135
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,791
Uh, no, that's wrong, so I guess
I can't give you the sword.

136
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,791
Well... let's keep on going...!

137
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,041
We can't rely on
that sword anyway!

138
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,708
Heh... I totally didn't see that
twist in the story coming...!

139
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,791
Most excellent...! Bravo!

140
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,416
Who's making all that noise?

141
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,500
Oh, crap! I must've
fallen asleep on the set!

142
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,041
Should I get up, or just...?
No, I've got to!

143
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,041
I'll just tell the
truth and apologize.

144
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,958
Princess...! We have
come here to rescue you!

145
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:09,416
Okay... I'll keep it
going for you, Tenma!

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,708
Here!

147
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,958
And so, in order
to save the princess

148
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,291
from her prison of sleep,

149
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,458
the six brave heroes found
themselves face to face

150
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,083
in pitched battle with
the evil witch's minions!

151
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,458
Look out, I'm coming
to get you! Rawr!

152
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,125
I have been slain!

153
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,500
Prince Tenma!

154
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,375
Get back you, foul beast!

155
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,250
Charge!

156
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,083
Prince Karen, no!

157
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,333
Hurry!

158
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,500
Pumpkin attack!

159
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,791
We must avenge the
loss of Prince Karen!

160
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,625
Right!

161
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,791
Prince Madoka! Prince Ayano!

162
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,666
Her soldiers are
tougher than I expected!

163
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,000
And so the princes fell,
one after another,

164
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,458
until at last only one remained.

165
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,041
Now what...? What happens next?

166
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,000
I have finally come for you...

167
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,041
My beautiful lady,
even in my dreams

168
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,375
I have been in love
with you forever.

169
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,291
I, Prince Eri am
here to rescue you.

170
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,708
Princess... with my kiss,

171
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,750
may your hundred years of
slumber finally come to an...

172
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:22,583
Uh... I... Prince Eri have
come to rescue you...

173
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,500
With my kiss, may
your hundred years

174
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,583
of slumber finally
come to an end...

175
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,625
Not feelin' it!

176
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,958
You got faced!

177
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,125
Better luck next
time, she-prince!

178
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:37,250
Come on, Whiskers...! It's not
like I want to do this either!

179
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,916
Princess!

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,375
Will you just wake up?!

181
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,541
Sorry...

182
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,291
What are you doing in there?!

183
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,916
Well, I, uh...

184
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,875
I hope you're happy...

185
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,958
Because of you
the play is ruined...

186
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,458
Have fun trying to
get us out of this one.

187
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,750
Someone got out of
the princess's bed!

188
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,916
Oh snap!

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,708
Yakumo...?! But how'd she...?

190
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:15,166
I... that is, I'm...
the evil witch of the tower.

191
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,708
And I just happen to know...

192
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,708
that this person is
extremely tired right now...

193
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,750
I think you should
just let her rest quietly

194
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,750
for the time being...

195
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,750
I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to let anyone

196
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,083
disturb this princess's
slumber, not even you,

197
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,875
Prince Eri,
so just leave her alone.

198
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,458
I'm not following everything,

199
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,958
but I think that
the witch has a point!

200
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,791
Yeah, she makes sense to me,
and she's really cute, too!

201
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,166
What is she doing?

202
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,416
Trying to make
me the villain...?

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,416
She's got a lot of nerve!

204
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,250
Enough...! I'm going to
wake up the princess...!

205
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,666
Now stand aside!

206
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,708
Do you think we should let
this go on, Akira...? Huh?

207
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,166
Guess I'm a little late.

208
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,958
You know, I've gotta say, their
acting is really convincing.

209
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,958
The prince or the witch...? Who
will claim the princess's lips?

210
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,541
Okay, how long are
you gonna keep this up?

211
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,750
You know, in the
script the prince

212
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,500
is the one who's
left at the end!

213
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,666
Yes... but I...

214
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,333
All right, that's it!

215
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,625
You're finished now, witch...!

216
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,041
Taste my cold steel
and suffer my wrath...

217
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,083
En garde!

218
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,375
Whoa... looks like that witch

219
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,083
is really in a
lotta trouble now!

220
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,875
This is the end!

221
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,666
She got him that time!
Nice counter!

222
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
Oh, that had to hurt!

223
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,708
Uh... are you all right?

224
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,416
Wow! He's coming back
at her even stronger!

225
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,583
Answer me, witch...!

226
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,791
Why do you stand between
me and the princess,

227
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,000
why do you wish to thwart me?

228
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,875
It's because the
princess and I...

229
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,666
have been together
for a hundred years

230
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,708
before you came along,
and I feel I must protect her...

231
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,541
Do you swear to me on your
honor you're telling the truth?

232
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,875
I give you my word,
Prince Eri...

233
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,583
Eri, what are you doing...?

234
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,375
I believe you.

235
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,708
I understand
your point of view...

236
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,208
and I won't
interfere any longer.

237
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,208
But though you've
driven me off for now...

238
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,708
there are still things
to be settled between us...

239
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,166
and I will not soon forget.

240
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
Farewell witch!

241
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,500
Uh... But I!

242
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,416
Wait... The prince
gave up...! So what's next?

243
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,916
I don't get it,
did the witch win,

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,708
or does something
else happen now?

245
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,416
So is the witch supposed
to kiss the princess?

246
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,333
She has to...! That's what
we came to see, after all!

247
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,958
Kiss her...! Kiss her...!
Kiss her...! Kiss her...!

248
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,541
Kiss her...!
Kiss her...! Kiss her...!

249
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,833
That's what she gets...
It isn't my fault.

250
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,916
Oh no... what should I do?

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,541
Wow... Poor girl!

252
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
What's Tsukamoto's
little sister gonna do?

253
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,791
What do you think...?

254
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,583
She's gotta give the
people what they want!

255
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,083
But... I can't just...

256
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,458
You're our only hope now...

257
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,666
Please, you must hurry and
wake the princess with a kiss...

258
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,666
Tenma-...! I mean,
uh, Prince Tenma!

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,291
Oh no, what are you doing...?!

260
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,000
Now I'll really have
to go through with it!

261
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:46,083
Okay, Tenma's Sister,
don't do anything hasty!

262
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:46,916
It's just...

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,916
Pretend... Okay, Harima?

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,041
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what do
you think you're doing...?

265
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,208
Story or no story,
this is too much!

266
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,333
I'll hide it... with my hat.

267
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,791
Mwah.

268
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,791
Wow... Akira's so bold...
What a smooch!

269
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,166
That was the
real deal...! Scandal!

270
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,291
The beautiful princess
at last was awakened

271
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,500
from a hundred
years of slumber...

272
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,833
And... uh... it says
here she went on to live...

273
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,125
happily ever after
with the lady spy...

274
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,000
All's well that
ends well, I suppose.

275
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,791
Come on, Yakumo...
it's our curtain call!

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,416
Go, go, go!

277
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,333
Bravo...! That was
absolutely inspiring...!

278
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,166
The greatest play
I've ever seen in my life!

279
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Hey!

280
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,375
Just because you're
Tenma's little sister

281
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,208
and we all know you,
do you think you can get away

282
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,833
with doing anything you want?

283
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,625
No, I'm sorry...!

284
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,708
I... I was only... trying...
trying to help.

285
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,833
Now, now there... both of
you just take it easy...

286
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:12,958
That kiss was on the nose,

287
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
so it's not like
it really counts.

288
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,041
Whiskers can go screw himself
for all I care, Akira...

289
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,541
That's not even
what this is about.

290
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,541
In any event, you
both did a great job

291
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
covering for Mikoto...
okay, girls...?

292
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,791
So let's just...
drop this for now.

293
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,000
That's fine with me...

294
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,458
but this is about her
being too disrespectful...

295
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,250
I just think she needs
to have someone remind her

296
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,458
to stay in her place
every now and again.

297
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,666
You don't understand...

298
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,333
Closing ceremonies might
get a little tense, huh...?

299
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,583
Sucks to be you.

300
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,750
Oh... Harima's kiss...

301
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,166
Do you want it back now?

302
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,833
Uh... no thanks... there's
really no need for that...

303
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,250
Okay...

304
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,916
The school cultural
festival has come

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,916
to its conclusion
without incident...

306
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,291
and now we come to
the closing festivities...

307
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,458
Oh, man...
he won't shut up... ah...!

308
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,500
I already got a text message
from that hottie I met...

309
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,708
Hi, Imadori!

310
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,166
Huh?

311
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,750
Oh, Ichijou... Aren't these
closing festivities lame?

312
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,500
Oh... they, uh, might
start to get interesting.

313
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,750
Watch the stage, okay?

314
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,333
Good job, girl, you go!

315
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,666
Uhh... and furthermore...

316
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,000
Huh...? My mic...

317
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,750
Hey, everybody...!
Let's skip the boring speeches

318
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,375
and throw ourselves a
real party tonight...!

319
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,583
The band that stopped the show

320
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,250
at this year's festival
has come by to play!

321
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,500
Are you ready to rock?

322
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,250
Hey...! Look there!

323
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,500
Wow...! A stage jacking!

324
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,875
Heeyy...! Wait a minute!

325
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,208
Here we go!

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,250
♪ Tonight has such a
graceful crescent moon, ♪

327
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,708
Man... she's incredible!

328
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,541
Yeah, they're really great!

329
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,833
...every night,
shining brighter

330
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:07,625
She is like something in
the heart of the moon

331
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,416
So, uh... you
wanna dance with me?

332
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,916
♪ ...in shades of blue ♪

333
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,750
♪ Do you know when
we'll be like a cat, ♪

334
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,291
♪ a wildcat, in a cage? ♪

335
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:23,750
♪ We cannot miss our time,
so let's find a getaway! ♪

336
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,458
Wow... I never knew she could
look that good... impressive.

337
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,291
Hey...! Sorry...
I was held up...

338
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,208
Oh, right... sorry...

339
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,208
I guess I'm not really
in the mood anymore.

340
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,375
Huh...? What do you mean?

341
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,458
Everyone's really getting
into it, aren't they?

342
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,875
Yeah, it's true.

343
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,750
Just look at all those
bodies writhing around.

344
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,958
Hey, Mikoto!

345
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,125
I suppose you're
looking for Yakumo?

346
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,541
No... I... wanted to say...
sorry about the play.

347
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,166
I don't mind really...

348
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,750
The class and the
audience both had a blast.

349
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,625
Yeah, that's true.

350
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,125
Although... I was looking
forward to playing the princess.

351
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,666
Well then...
let's continue the play.

352
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,541
Huh...? What are you... ah!

353
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,500
Asou...

354
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,583
I suppose Hanai
must've put you up to this.

355
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,541
It's cool...
don't force yourself...

356
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,791
And what makes you think
I need to force anything?

357
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,666
As long as we're
both all dressed up...

358
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
how about we just dance?

359
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:42,958
♪ Do you remember
what you said to me? ♪

360
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,750
Oh, man... check out
the prince and princess!

361
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,458
They look incredible together.

362
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,958
Yakumo!

363
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,083
Hey, Sis...

364
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,041
About the play... sorry...

365
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,208
Don't worry about it,
I'm cool with it.

366
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:01,083
You might want to say something
to Eri, though... okay?

367
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,500
She'll forget the whole
thing if you apologize.

368
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,833
Excuse me, Eri?

369
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,041
I'm sorry... about what happened
with the play and all.

370
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,625
Oh, that's okay...
I mean what's done is done.

371
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,583
I'm totally over it, so you
don't have to worry about it.

372
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,125
Have to admit... I owe you...

373
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,333
if it hadn't been for you
I would've had to go through

374
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,333
with that whole kissing
scene with Whiskers.

375
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
So... wanna dance?

376
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,250
I hate just standing
around like this.

377
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,958
Sure... I'd love
to dance with you.

378
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,708
Hey guys, get a load of that!

379
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,791
Aw... good...!
Looks like they made up!

380
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,416
Hey... I've been
wanting to ask you...

381
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,750
Is it really true
that you and Whiskers

382
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,375
have been seeing each other?

383
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,583
Oh, no... not really...
it's not like that...

384
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,125
Harima asked me...

385
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,208
to help him out on a project
he was working on, that's all...

386
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,333
I'm not seeing him, I swear it.

387
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,750
Hmm... I get it now.

388
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,333
Y'know, I have to say...

389
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,541
you really are a
very good dancer.

390
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:17,916
I guess... I used to dance a
lot when we lived overseas...

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,708
I'm going to speed things
up a bit... Can you keep up?

392
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,208
Uh... sure...

393
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,750
Then here goes!

394
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,291
You're pretty good yourself...

395
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,791
You know you really do
make me feel like a girl.

396
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,125
Somebody... please let me down.

397
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:56,166
Geez, how can you forget to
bring lunches to a picnic? Huh?

398
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,833
The boys are gonna
make the lunch?

399
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,333
Are you sure about this?

400
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,875
Next time on School Rumble:

401
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:04,000
"Fight, Hunter! Fight, Eater!
Fight, Part Time Worker!"

402
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,750
Maybe I should make the lunch...
