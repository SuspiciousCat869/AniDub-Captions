1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,125
Stop! We can't take anymore!

2
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:22,375
You're the only one left!
We'll finish this right now!

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,791
Guys...

4
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,750
This is the end for you!

5
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,791
Please stop this!

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,916
My next move will finish you!

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,916
Not so fast!

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,166
Wha... who's that?

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,208
Just leave this to us!

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,125
Dentaku...! Budo...! Nihil!

11
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,500
You guys don't know
when to quit...! Get them!

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,083
Don't worry, I've
already calculated how

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,708
to counter their moves!

14
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,416
That's enough out of you!

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,375
Thanks, you guys!

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,208
Fools! It's no use!

17
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,458
You have no choice
but to give up!

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,916
The heck we do...! All that
matters is our fighting spirit!

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,166
And that's what we're
gonna hit you with!

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,041
I'll knock it right back at ya!

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,958
Roaring Burst!

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,541
Galactic Bomber!

23
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,250
You... you did it!

24
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,458
And I have you guys to thank!

25
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,125
Our fight is just
getting started!

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,500
Basketball...
It so rocks my socks!

27
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,333
Now, sis... that's not real.

28
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,083
Huh... Huh-huh...!
Da, da, da, da... da-dah!

29
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,458
Duwa!

30
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:22,625
Okay, I'm up for some
basketball...! Yeah!

31
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,000
So when did Tenma
become a basketball freak?

32
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,333
Man, Sagano really kicks ass!

33
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,125
I'll say!

34
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,416
She's amazing, huh?

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,708
She was in basketball
club in middle school.

36
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,250
She was one of the
regulars, starting first year.

37
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,291
How cool...!
She's got ninja reflexes!

38
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,625
So why doesn't she play now
that she's in high school?

39
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,583
There's no girls'
basketball team...

40
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
it's really too bad you know?

41
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,041
Yeah that sucks.

42
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,708
All right, the boys'
game is about to start!

43
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,833
Asou!

44
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,375
Suga, you gotta
D-up man, he's quick!

45
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,583
Dude, not cool!
There's chicks watching!

46
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,375
Oh, yeah...! That's so cool!

47
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,083
I'll bet you anything Asou
makes captain next term.

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,333
Go, Asou!

49
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,375
Rock steady cause they
ain't even ready! Yeah!

50
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,916
Wow...! That was bad ass!

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,125
Where the heck
did that come from?!

52
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,708
Uh, a little help
here...? I'm stuck.

53
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,166
Basketball rules...!

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,208
I want to get out there
pull a Galactic Bomber

55
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,833
on those fools! Yup, yup!

56
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,875
What's a Galactic Bomber?

57
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,083
You don't know?

58
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:50,791
No idea.

59
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,166
Roaring Burst!!

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,166
What?

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,416
Really?

62
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,083
You'll serve as
the faculty advisor

63
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,041
for a girls' basketball club?

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,041
Sure, since one of my
favorite students asked me to.

65
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,125
If you really think you want me,
I'll be glad to give it a shot.

66
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,625
Then I'll put together
a team right away!

67
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,625
I'd like to be ready for this
month's district tournament,

68
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,916
if that's possible!

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,750
Oh, hey...

70
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,041
Mr. Tani, you're the advisor

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,041
for the boys' basketball
club, aren't you?

72
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,958
Yes... that's right.

73
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,250
Well, can you recommend
anyone who could help us out?

74
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,166
Huuuh...? Mr. Tani said
I have to give you guys a hand?

75
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,625
Yep...! He said that when
it comes to basketball,

76
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,583
you were the go to guy!

77
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,833
Well, what can I say?

78
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,000
If he's just gonna
spring this on me, okay...

79
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,958
I guess first I should
discuss this with Sagano.

80
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,750
Thank you so much!

81
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,250
What...? A girls'
basketball club...?

82
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,708
Count me in...! I'm with you!

83
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,500
Satsuki Tawaraya,
is it...? Hey, girl!

84
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,125
It's a pleasure to meet you.

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,083
You know I...
I used to watch you play

86
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,666
all the time in
middle school,...

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,000
I have to say you were
incredible out there!

88
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,958
Oh, now you're embarrassing me!

89
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,625
But way to go, starting
a girls' basketball club!

90
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,458
Oh my gosh!

91
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,333
It's gonna be so much fun...

92
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,125
What have I gotten myself into?

93
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,958
Sorry... I really wish
I could help you guys out...

94
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,833
but it's not my game... huh?

95
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,458
Oh... maybe you should
ask Mikoto over there.

96
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,083
Huh...? But I've got dojo duty.

97
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,958
Come on...!
Can't you get out of it?

98
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,375
Of course she can.

99
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,333
I'll cover for you...

100
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,791
It's a good idea to try
something new now and then.

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,041
He's right, Mikoto!

102
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
Let's give it a shot!
Let's play! Let's play!

103
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,041
They're not asking you, Tenma.

104
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,625
Okay, you can count me in.

105
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,416
Ah, sweet!

106
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,791
Now that we've
finally got a team,

107
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,000
we're really ready to rock!

108
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,375
How's that...? I have won, no?

109
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,916
When she heard
Ichijou was playing...

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,875
...she insisted we
teach her basketball.

111
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,958
She's in intensive training.

112
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,333
Very... at least now
she aims for the goal.

113
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,666
Well, have fun...
she's all yours, man.

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,833
Thanks.

115
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,000
That was incredible!

116
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,250
We can use a player like you!

117
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,500
As manager, I'm putting
you on the team!

118
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,791
Talent like yours comes
along once in a lifetime!

119
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,333
Ms. Anegasaki, do you
know the rules of basketball?

120
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,375
Of course I do.

121
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,666
You aim for that little square

122
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,500
on the home plate
thingie, right?

123
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,750
Uh... never mind...

124
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,166
Okay, there's one month
before the tournament!

125
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,000
The first thing you guys need to
work on is building team work!

126
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,125
So right off, I'm going to give
all of you team nicknames!

127
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,750
Huh?

128
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,166
You, first year...

129
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,708
We're gonna call
you Rookie, got it?

130
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,833
Right...! Rookie
reporting for duty!

131
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,250
We'll call you Hostess!

132
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,000
You mean because my family
runs a restaurant, right?

133
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,875
You're Itchy!

134
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,916
Okay... I guess...

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,083
Tits McGee...! I mean, Mickey!

136
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,791
Wait... What was the
first part of that again?!

137
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,375
And Gori...! It couldn't
be anything else!

138
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,125
Gracias, Senorita Tae...!

139
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,125
I really like the
sound of that name!

140
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,375
It makes me want
to smash things!

141
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,708
By the way, Ichijou,
what does, uh, "Gori" mean?

142
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,750
Uh, well, it's short
for something

143
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,291
very big and strong and smart...

144
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,416
Si! That name is perfect
for me! I am Gori!

145
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,125
And kind of hairy...

146
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,625
Ichijou! You tricked me!

147
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,208
Once you get the ball...
twist your hips sideways

148
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,250
and fake with your
head and shoulders...!

149
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,458
Protect the ball...!

150
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,583
This is where Ichijou
makes her move!

151
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,000
Nice shot, girl.

152
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,250
Wow... I can't believe it.
We don't completely suck!

153
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,250
It's all 'cause Satsuki
is such a good coach!

154
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,458
Great job...! You know, you're
really starting to get this!

155
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,541
Aren't you going to practice?

156
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,958
All you've done is coach.

157
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,125
Oh, I'll train, too...

158
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,666
I promise, kay...?

159
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,416
We're doing individual
drills next... Oh!

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,958
Don't push yourself too hard.

161
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,583
You're the backbone
of the team, you know.

162
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,375
Right...! Thank you
very much, Asou!

163
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,583
You know, this is
a good opportunity

164
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,000
for you to get closer to Asou.

165
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,416
Know your enemy
and know yourself,

166
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,875
and you will be safe
even in a hundred battles!

167
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,958
A girl named Sonko wrote that
in an essay a long time ago...

168
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,958
so don't give up!

169
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,166
I don't know what you mean...

170
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,875
Asou is just another student.

171
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,291
Another student you love!

172
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:30,541
Heed the words of Sonko...!
And they'll serve you well!

173
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,625
Yeah, now that
I've actually tried it,

174
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm starting to really
get into basketball...

175
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,708
but morning practice
is kinda lame.

176
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,708
You've been doing
it a week, right...?

177
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,958
You guys have really
been going at it hard.

178
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,583
So, what is it that made
you get serious about it?

179
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,291
I guess...

180
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,000
It's from watching Satsuki...

181
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,458
She works so hard it's
kind of inspiring, you know?

182
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Oh, That first year girl...?

183
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,583
Yeah, she's pretty
intense about it.

184
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,458
Still, her height puts her
at quite a disadvantage.

185
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,875
I hear that no matter
how much she eats,

186
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,416
and she eats a lot, she just
can't seem to grow any.

187
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,541
How d'you know?

188
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,750
Well, she's one of
Yakumo's classmates.

189
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,958
Oh, that's right.

190
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,000
And I know something
else about Satsuki...

191
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,250
What are you laughing about?

192
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,291
Just 'tween us...

193
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,416
apparently she's got it
and got it bad for Asou!

194
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,000
Now that you mention it,

195
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,916
it does seem like she's
standing right next to him,

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,250
like all the time.

197
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,708
You see, you see...?
Teen romance strikes again!

198
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,166
That's great and all,

199
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,583
but are you ever gonna make
it to a morning practice?

200
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,333
Well, I did get up once,

201
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,875
but the charms of my mattress
kind of lured me back in.

202
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,416
"Once"?

203
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,041
So you haven't made it to any
of the morning sessions yet?

204
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,083
Ah, uh, no...

205
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
All right, now turn!

206
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,875
Now shoot!

207
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,666
Ahh, so close!

208
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,208
You're awesome... Seriously...

209
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,250
It's really cool of you to
coach me one on one like this.

210
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,625
Hey, it's no big deal...
you're really good at this...

211
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,000
Plus, you've got the height.

212
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,666
Ah, it's whatev.

213
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,375
Hey, Mikoto... you want to play
a little one on one with me?

214
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,416
Sure, why not? It'll be fun!

215
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,541
Damn, she's good!

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,458
That what's known
as a quick turn...

217
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,625
Still got a lot to learn,
haven't you?

218
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,958
Roaring Burst!
Galactic Bomberrrrrr!

219
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,083
I'm totally starving...!
Let's get something to eat!

220
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,625
Iiiiii love food!

221
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,166
I know...! Asou, your place
is a Chinese restaurant, right?

222
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,625
Uh...? Yeah... it sure is.

223
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,791
All right then!

224
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,250
Let's have dinner
at Asou's place!

225
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,500
To the feast!

226
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,458
Okay...! Now that
you've gotten that settled

227
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,625
you can leave
everything to me, ladies!

228
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,958
What the hell, man...?

229
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,500
Where'd you even come from?!

230
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,833
Muchas gracias!

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,541
I'll see you guys later.

232
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,125
Wait a minute... you're
not gonna eat with us?

233
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,625
Oh... I'm afraid
I have something I have

234
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,500
to take care of right
now... so I can't come.

235
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,166
Best food ever!

236
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,791
Let's hear it for Asou!

237
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,375
Yaaay!

238
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,208
I wonder what Satsuki's
big errand was?

239
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
Welcome to... huh?

240
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,000
Tawaraya?

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,875
I'd like one Koraku
full belly dinner!

242
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,458
What...? You can stop staring,

243
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,125
it's not like
I followed you here,

244
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,333
I've been planning
on eating dinner here

245
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,750
all day so you
can just ignore me

246
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,458
and go on about your business.

247
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,166
One Koraku full belly dinner.

248
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,666
I gotta say, you look
pretty natural back there.

249
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,583
I live and work in
Chinese restaurants...

250
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,041
I should look natural.

251
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,250
Excuse me, Asou?

252
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,291
What is it...?
Can I get you anything else?

253
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,250
I'd like another one of these
full belly dinners, please.

254
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,250
Oh... sure...
You already finished?

255
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,750
Here you go, another
full belly dinner.

256
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,875
Now that you mention it...

257
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,541
where do you work?

258
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,500
At Muo Li's, by the station.

259
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,458
Oh, yeah, I've seen that place.

260
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,666
Yeah, Suga and the
guys go there a lot.

261
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,458
Excuse me, Asou?

262
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,750
What's up?

263
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,958
I'd like one more of
these full belly dinners.

264
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,625
Wow... Can we
say eating disorder?

265
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,083
Excuse me, Asou?

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,333
I'd like... to give...

267
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,250
...compliments to the chef.

268
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,750
Hey!

269
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,958
Don't worry about it...

270
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,875
I'm going that way anyway...
I'll just drop her off.

271
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,583
Thanks, Suou.

272
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,458
You know, you're pretty
cute when you're asleep.

273
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,958
It's admirable, the way
she dedicates herself

274
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,750
one hundred
percent to everything...

275
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,458
It's like she doesn't care about
making a fool of herself...

276
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,541
be it for love, or for sports...

277
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,875
How many people
can say they do that?

278
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,708
She's got guts...
I could learn from her.

279
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,666
Twenty full belly dinners with
extra rice comes to 18,000 yen.

280
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,958
No!

281
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,291
Wait, sis!

282
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,833
Here's your boxed lunch...!

283
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,000
You're going to be getting a
real workout, so I packed extra!

284
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,458
That's my little sister! Thanks!

285
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,291
Now I'll be able to
keep up my energy...

286
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,875
and do slam dunks like the pros!

287
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,500
Good morning...!
Everyone ready to practice?

288
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,375
Come on people!

289
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,958
Let's focus...! You guys are
all over the place out there,

290
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,750
it's supposed to
be about team work!

291
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,125
Right!

292
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,458
Hey! Isn't there
one too many girls?

293
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Tenma!

294
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,875
Ms. Tae! What
position should I play?

295
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, we need to have a
serious talk about that.

296
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,333
Thank goodness...!

297
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,833
I'm the only one who
doesn't have a nickname yet,

298
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,833
so I was really getting worried!

299
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,958
See, Tenma... the thing is...

300
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,208
and I only found
this out yesterday...

301
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,666
it turns out that
basket ball is played

302
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,000
with only five
players, not six...

303
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,916
So until one of the
other girls gets tired

304
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,458
and decides to drop out,

305
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,708
I'm putting you on
a special program.

306
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,291
Say what?

307
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,750
Uh, Tenma?

308
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,083
Are you done
practicing already...?

309
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,416
I was coming to cheer
you on... or am I too late?

310
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,041
Not at all...!
I'm still practicing!

311
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,166
They said I need my own program!

312
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,041
Ya see... I'm a slow starter!

313
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,166
Really...? Well,
hang in there, sis.

314
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
Right...! Go! Team! Go! Team!

315
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,291
Go! Team! Go! Team!

316
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,208
It won't go in!

317
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,583
Oh, Lara, please calm down!

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,583
Come on, Lara, take
your shooting position.

319
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,541
Like this?

320
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,833
No, you're using way
too much force in here.

321
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,541
Your left arm should be
mostly used for support, see?

322
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,875
Like this?

323
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,666
Wow...! It went in!

324
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,583
Muchisimas gracias, Satsuki!

325
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
Okay, now you join in!

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,750
Free throws for everyone!

327
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,791
Are you sure?

328
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,250
Si! Por su puesto

329
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,625
Does that mean yes?

330
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,708
Oh wow, they're already
doing one on one...?

331
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,041
Mikoto is really
coming along, isn't she?

332
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,416
Yeah... I know...

333
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,791
She's a regular Tiger Woods.

334
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,333
Now! To the right!

335
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,791
I can't shake this guy!

336
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,458
Oh, don't tell me
that's all you got.

337
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,625
Get away from me...
Captain Pervo!

338
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,125
Right now why don't
you just call me Coach.

339
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,500
Now let's try it again...

340
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,041
Lemme show you how it's done--

341
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,916
Okay, what do think
you're doing here, doofus?

342
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,041
All right, just watch it

343
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,750
with that doofus stuff,
wiener breath!

344
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,875
I came here to coach!

345
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,500
Believe it or not,
I'm walkin' on air!

346
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,833
Check it!

347
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,208
Just watch and
see how it's done!

348
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,958
Way to go boobs for brains...

349
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,083
Imadori, if you're
just gonna screw around...

350
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,250
No, it's not like that!

351
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,250
Ichijou, come on,
help me out here, will you?

352
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Imadori, I appreciate
the sentiment, honestly,

353
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,916
but... you should go.

354
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,041
Try keeping your arms
closer... ease up a little.

355
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,083
I know...! Tawaraya...!
Could you show Suou here...?

356
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,291
You've got the best form
of anyone on the team.

357
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,625
Of course!

358
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,750
What the heck...?

359
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,833
Try again... maybe you
just tense or something.

360
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,875
Why...? Why?!

361
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,875
Don't give up, Satsuki!

362
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,041
Remember the old saying, "the
NBA is a dream within a dream!"

363
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,208
I don't think that's
quite right, Lara.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,750
Go team, go...

365
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,083
Hey, sis! It's about
time for morning practice!

366
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,750
Uh... Yakumo...

367
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,833
I thought I'd maybe take
a little time off from...

368
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,000
Here's your lunch!

369
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,541
Kinda big, isn't it?

370
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,208
I thought you might want to
share it with the other players.

371
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,375
It seems like it's
been a long time...

372
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,125
since you were so
excited about something...

373
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,375
This is my way of
showing I support you.

374
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,541
I'm behind you... Sis.

375
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,750
All right! I'll do my best!

376
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,875
Tenma didn't show up
for practice again today...

377
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,208
I wonder what's wrong?

378
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,041
I'm sorry... Tenma...

379
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,375
for putting you in
this difficult position...

380
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,708
but it should only be
a little while longer...

381
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,458
Sooner or later, someone
will get tired and quit...

382
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,416
and then you'll be our...
oh, what is that term...?

383
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,916
Oh, right! Our ball buster!

384
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,208
Lara...! The basket's there!

385
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,791
Huh...? Ay, no entiendo!

386
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,000
Holy crap.

387
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,583
That's a pretty scary
team you've got there.

388
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,833
I have to admit,
your girls have managed

389
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,083
to re-ignite the burning
passion for basketball

390
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,583
I thought I had lost
when I left America.

391
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,083
You... sure you're
passion's for basketball?

392
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,416
Come on, ladies, just say it...

393
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,583
you're still missing
something special, aren't you?

394
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,208
Are you ready to take
on Tougou Masakazu,

395
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,083
the guy the Americans used
to call the Big Bull of Texas?

396
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,625
The winner gets to take
the loser out on a date.

397
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,166
No, thanks.

398
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,291
Humph... I see...

399
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,541
You guys aren't ready for
the Big Bull challenge yet.

400
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,041
Forget it then. Your loss.

401
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,291
Harry... I'm leaving
Lara in your hands.

402
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,541
Great... I'll do what I can.

403
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,875
Adios!

404
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,291
Okay... let's finish up
with some shuttle runs!

405
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,833
Right!

406
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,375
Man, I don't know what it is,

407
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:26,000
but I feel like we have the
power to... to just kick ass!

408
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,125
Come on, Sis...!
Time for practice!

409
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,708
Listen, Yakumo...
about basketball practice...

410
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,125
Here you go!
Plenty for everyone!

411
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,666
You think I overdid it?

412
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,375
No, no, it's fine...! After
practice everyone is starving!

413
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,041
If it wasn't for your lunches,

414
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,541
we wouldn't have the strength
to rock out on the court!

415
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,625
Really...? I'm so glad!

416
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,125
In fact, today I think
I'll have enough extra energy

417
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,750
to score a double dribble!

418
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,083
That sounds amazing, Sis!

419
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Tenma, we need to talk.

420
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,250
I think you have a problem.

421
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,041
She's like a mindless
eating machine.

422
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:01,875
What happened?

423
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,666
Beats me.

424
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,250
Hey, Sis, have you
been gaining some weight?

425
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,750
I've been going overboard
on those lunches, haven't I?

426
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,500
No, no, not at all,
not at all...!

427
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,666
I've been putting on weight

428
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,458
for our body-checking
defense strategy!

429
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,708
Oh, good...

430
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,041
You're really serious
about this, huh, Sis?

431
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,125
Absolutely...! It wouldn't
be practice for anyone

432
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,041
if I wasn't there
doing my thing!

433
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,750
Mentirosa!

434
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,875
When will I get
back on the team...?

435
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,583
When can I start
my special program?

436
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,250
They say that when a tiger dies,
it leaves behind no hide.

437
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,833
Tougou?

438
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,500
Trust me, you're not the only
one who's been treated badly...

439
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,666
Lift up your head and
take a look around you.

440
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,458
Huh...? Imadori...? and Harima?

441
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,041
Quite a coincidence, huh...?

442
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,916
It turns out I've been
getting into basketball too.

443
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,916
It comes down to
just two things...

444
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,208
the ball and the goal...

445
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,416
...when you've got those,

446
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,750
and get your best team
mates around you,

447
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,416
then you've got basketball!

448
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,750
All of us became outlaws

449
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,041
before we even knew
it was happening!

450
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,250
Let's show those guys
just what we're made of!

451
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,416
Right! As of now,
you're all in special training!

452
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,666
Yeah!

453
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,083
There's a cold wind a brewin'...

454
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,208
Hey! I'm Drive!

455
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,583
Next time on Bam Star Basketball
Gang: "Pass! Dribble! Shoot!"

456
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,541
Roaring Burst...!

457
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,083
Galactic Boooommmberrrrr!

458
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,875
Bam! Bam!
Bam Star Basketball Gang! Yeah!
