1
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,958
Okay... quiet!!

2
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,958
We're the only class
that hasn't decided

3
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,083
on a culture festival program!

4
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,125
Come on, we have to
make our decision by today,

5
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,333
but you guys are
such slackers...!

6
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,208
How did I get stuck
having to handle you

7
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,708
big bunch of idiots
all by myself?

8
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,625
Please, Mai... take it easy.

9
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,625
Obviously, we have to do a play.

10
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:07,541
I mean, come on, what else would
you do for a culture festival?

11
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,000
Whoa, Imadori is serious!

12
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,666
Yes, yes, yes! Sleeping Beauty!

13
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,333
It just so happens
I've written a script.

14
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,250
What?

15
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,000
Let me see that!

16
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Lame!

17
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,583
You know nothing about art!

18
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,833
I don't know, I think the coffee
shop would be a good idea.

19
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,625
I really like the maid
outfits... they're cool.

20
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,500
Yeah... I'd look
great in one of those!

21
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,125
What are you all
looking at me for?

22
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,208
I would never wear
a maid costume.

23
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,625
If it were left up to me...

24
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,875
I'd say we should all do a play.

25
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,208
No, the coffee shop's better!

26
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,791
Oh, yeah...

27
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,916
I'm totally into the idea
of the girls in maid outfits.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,833
Maid outfits?

29
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,333
The coffee shop has my vote too!

30
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,125
Coffee shop... Maid outfits...

31
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,333
So what do you think,
you guys into it?

32
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,250
Oh hell yeah! You got my vote!

33
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,250
I'm good either way.

34
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,125
Coffee shop!
Coffee shop all the way!

35
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,625
I want Sleeping Beauty!
Yay! Yay!

36
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,208
Dude, the coffee shop is better!
Maid outfits! Hello!

37
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,000
Nurse uniforms
would be good too.

38
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,166
But dude Sawachika would

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,916
be smokin' as the
princess in the play!

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,875
Instead of a guy,
have Mikoto be prince. Hot!

41
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,125
Come on, guys, let's
think about this seriously!

42
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:27,291
How can I clear up this
misunderstanding with Tenma?

43
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,958
There's nothing between
her sister and me!

44
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,750
Aww, for the love of Mike!

45
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,875
Enough yakking,
we'll decide between the play

46
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,541
and the shop by majority vote!

47
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,416
Not so fast!

48
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,541
We don't want the
play or the coffee shop!

49
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,166
The three of us want
swimsuit sumo wrestling!

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,625
Huh...? But I didn't say...

51
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,250
The girls of 2-C all change
into swimsuits and battle!

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,791
School swimsuits
would be fine...

53
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,000
But bikinis or thongs
would be totally... sweet!

54
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,500
You know, guys, I really didn't
want to in the first place.

55
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,333
Great, so now we have a tie...!

56
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,000
And what's more,
not everyone voted!

57
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,625
Okay, at this rate
it's gonna take,

58
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,041
like, forever to settle this.

59
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,208
It would help if our
class coordinator

60
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,541
would snap out of it.

61
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:26,291
Why, why, why, why, why,
why, why, why, why, why...

62
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,208
I think I know
how to revive them.

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,250
For real...? Do you have a plan?

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,458
Of course, don't I always?

65
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
Hey, Harima...

66
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,625
Do you mind?

67
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,958
I've written a play.
I'd like your opinion.

68
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,250
Looks great...

69
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,833
Look closer.

70
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,250
Kenji Harima...
three votes for the play!

71
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,500
Now there's a three vote margin!

72
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,458
That settles it!

73
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,708
No fair!

74
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,958
Amazing! I didn't know
Harima had three votes!

75
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,583
If the coffee shop wins,

76
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,416
the tea club will offer its
full cooperation, naturally.

77
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
And that includes Yakumo.

78
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,541
Haruki Hanai...

79
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,291
five votes for the coffee shop!

80
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,333
He said five?

81
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,791
How is that even possible!

82
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,208
It's another surprise reversal!

83
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,583
Akira, that's amazing...

84
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,125
You know, you really have a
talent for this sort of stuff.

85
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,375
It's whatev.

86
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,625
What the hell?

87
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,125
Since when do you get
five votes, you bastard?

88
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,958
Are you trying to make
a joke out of democracy?

89
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,166
What does a delinquent like
you know about democracy?

90
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,500
I know plenty.

91
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,500
You know nothing! Nothing I say!

92
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,958
But it's still a tie,
you guys...!

93
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,125
You each only get one vote!

94
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,458
I don't think they're listening.

95
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,416
If you have a moment...?
I have a pretty awesome idea.

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,750
It's all yours... anything...!

97
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,333
Let's settle it with a game.

98
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
Game? You're nuts.

99
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,583
It's gonna take a
lot more than a game

100
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,666
to settle things
between the two of us!

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,416
Why don't you go play
with your tea set, girlie?

102
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,958
A survival game.

103
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,875
What's she talking about?
A survival game?

104
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,375
Oh man, that's totally hot.

105
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,625
Sleeping Beauty!

106
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,416
One, two!

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,000
Three, four!

108
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:34,750
One, two!

109
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,583
Three, four!

110
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,375
One, two!

111
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,166
Three, four!

112
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,958
One, two!

113
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,791
Three, four!

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,541
I don't care if I get paid!

115
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,250
I don't care if I get paid!!

116
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,250
Give me figures,
a nurse and a maid!

117
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,541
Give me figures,
a nurse and a maid!!

118
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,208
I don't care what you assume!

119
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,375
I don't care what you assume!!

120
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,000
I like a girl in a hot costume!

121
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,958
I like a girl in a hot costume!!

122
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,416
Okay guys, let's do
this for the coffee shop.

123
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,791
Takano here...
Everything is ready...

124
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,000
Neither the Coffee Shop Team

125
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,666
or the Play Team are
missing any players...

126
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,750
I congratulate everyone
for having the courage

127
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,416
to participate,
even at such a late hour.

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,291
Sir! Yes, sir!

129
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,625
The rules are as
laid out earlier...

130
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,125
Until one team
takes the other's flag,

131
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,708
you are to continue
fighting each other

132
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,500
until the bitter end...

133
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,333
No areas are off-limits...

134
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,833
You may set up any
barricades you want...

135
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,750
Ten minutes from now...

136
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,625
I will sound the
chime to begin battle...

137
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,125
Good luck... all of you.

138
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,833
Sir! Yes, sir!

139
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,458
Attention, everybody...!
Here's our strategy!

140
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,541
Harima and Sawachika are,

141
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,291
without a doubt, the
play team's main force.

142
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,708
We're on the fourth floor,
in classroom 3-F...

143
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,416
and the play team's
on the second floor,

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083
in classroom 1-A...

145
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,708
I don't know where the enemy's
main force will move...

146
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,083
...but we'll concentrate most
of our efforts to defense,

147
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,750
stationed near the staircases...

148
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,125
Our offensive force will consist

149
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,291
only of our most
skilled warriors.

150
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,125
What's the deal with the stairs?

151
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,041
It's much easier to for us
to attack vertically, that way.

152
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,166
They're narrow, difficult for
the enemy to maneuver in,

153
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
and simpler to defend.

154
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,958
The horizontal plane
presents much more

155
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,791
of a challenge since it
allows more people through.

156
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,333
Now, the girls will be
in charge of defense...

157
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,208
while the men will be
in charge of offense...

158
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,666
Hey, Madoka!

159
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,000
Shigeo!

160
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,500
Isn't coming here
against the rules?

161
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,125
Why did you go over to
the coffee shop side...?

162
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,541
I thought you were
all for the play!

163
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,958
I don't have to be with
you on everything, Shigeo.

164
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,208
But... Madoka...

165
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,208
I'm sorry but...

166
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,833
Listen... the
next time I see you

167
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,833
I won't hesitate to shoot you.

168
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,208
What? Hey...

169
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,291
Bye-bye!

170
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,041
We'll engage the
enemy on the fourth floor

171
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,083
and advance swiftly,
taking control

172
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,208
of the east stairwell
as quickly as possible!

173
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,500
Oh... I get it.

174
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,666
Hey, that's not a bad strategy.

175
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,416
Right then, let's move out.

176
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,625
Yeah!

177
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,250
Go, go, go, go, go!

178
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,750
Got 'em pretty
stirred up, haven't you?

179
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,541
Move it, we have to get
control of the east stairwell

180
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,708
before the play team can
establish a position there!

181
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,291
All right, it looks like
we're the first ones here!

182
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,416
We have it occupied!

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,833
Good work, team, we...

184
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,708
Someone's there...?!
They're fast...

185
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,916
I have to keep
my aim... Harima?!

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,333
Dodge...!
But there's no time...!

187
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,875
Jump!

188
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,458
You okay?

189
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,958
Quick, we'll take
cover in the classroom!

190
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,750
Just what the hell is going on
here...?

191
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,500
It seems like the
entire play team

192
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,458
is coming down
on us all of a sudden!

193
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,666
Where are our guys?

194
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,041
Probably safe...

195
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,166
I saw them take cover
in the other classrooms.

196
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,333
That means it's just
you and me soldier...

197
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,958
all alone on the front
lines... This'll be tough.

198
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,125
They're sure laying down...

199
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,166
a lotta fire...
that seems weird.

200
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,291
Wait a minute...

201
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,625
It could be... a trap.

202
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,750
Huh?

203
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,333
While they've got
us pinned down here,

204
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,916
their main force could be moving
this way classroom by classroom,

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,250
which means we might be screwed.

206
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,625
Look like it's
all clear... let's go.

207
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,958
They'll never guess
there's a third force

208
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,541
about to move against them...

209
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,666
The element of surprise gives
us the edge in this battle...

210
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,083
The Swimsuit Sumo Wrestling Team
is sure to emerge victorious!

211
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,041
Are you really positive?

212
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's roll...
Hey... Nishimoto...

213
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,500
I think I'm stuck.

214
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,500
Hurry it up...

215
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,750
We have to be as stealthy
as ninjas, so be quiet!

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,125
Yup. Definitely stuck.

217
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,333
Screw him... Let's go...

218
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,208
Uh... 'kay.

219
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
What's that?

220
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Harima...! It looks
like he showed up!

221
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,708
It's a good thing we decided

222
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:00,416
to take cover in the
back of the classroom!

223
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,291
My eyes...! I can't see!

224
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,583
We're through!

225
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,875
Not on my watch!

226
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,916
Hanai...! You saved us...!

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,333
You made it through that
hail of bullets to get here!

228
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,916
Nice sunglasses, by the way.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,208
We must fall back!

230
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,833
We're giving up
this ground? Why?

231
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,833
Because of the enemy's strategy.

232
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,750
I believe they're
trying to distract us...

233
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,541
and keep us occupied
here on the 4th floor.

234
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,166
What are you saying?

235
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,291
At first it seems like
they're attacking in earnest,

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,708
but they withdraw too easily,
just like Harima did.

237
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,958
It's a fake...
it's just a diversion...

238
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,333
they're attacking the
2nd floor right now...

239
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,625
No casualties... not yet anyway.

240
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,916
So why don't we
counterattack instead?

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If we did... our position
would be compromised.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,875
Retreat, quickly...!
Asou and the other guy, move it!

243
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,958
What do you mean,
"the other guy"?

244
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,791
Kenji Harima... it has
to be me who takes you on.

245
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,916
We don't have to worry,
Asou and the other guy

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,541
should be here
any minute now, 'kay!

247
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,583
That's great...!
But they better hurry!

248
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,000
No kidding, we're out of ammo!

249
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,708
We've gotta hang on
until they get here!

250
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sorry...

251
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,000
My last club meeting
ran a little late!

252
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,291
Oh, that's okay!

253
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,375
At last our
songbird has arrived!

254
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,375
How were things going
at the main building...?

255
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,625
Aren't they playing that...
game thingy?

256
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,125
Oh, right... beats me, I didn't
go to the main building.

257
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,125
Well... who cares about them...

258
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,041

to start practicing?

have to go this far?

there's nothing

we can do
about it now...

our tails off and like
everything!

But... there's nowhere
else we can perform.

319
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,708
Looks like we'll
just have to give it up.

320
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,083
Not if we join in the
survival game, we won't.

321
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,791
If we win the game,
we'll get the classroom...

322
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,375
We'll just jump in
the middle of the fight

323
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,416
and take them all out.

324
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,208
Asou and the other guys helping

325
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,791
really turned this
situation around!

326
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,208
If Hanai can get
control of the 4th floor,

327
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,208
we might have a chance
of winning this thing.

328
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,000
Mina!

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,541
Asou...! Enemy to the
rear...! We've lost two!

330
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,708
What the...?

331
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,500
Do something quick or we're
gonna be ambushed by the enemy!

332
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,875
How the hell did the
enemy get behind us?

333
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,333
Hey... there... what was that?!

334
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,333
I know that hairstyle!

335
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,375
Sawachika!

336
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,166
Stop her...!
She's after our flag!

337
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,541
What have we here?

338
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,583
Now that seems unfair...

339
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,166
The balance of power
is shifting too much.

340
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,000
I really shouldn't get involved
in a children's quarrel,

341
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,375
but on the other hand...

342
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,666
Suga! Get back here fast!

343
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,083
They're attacking like crazy!

344
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,416
We can't hold them
off by ourselves!

345
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I managed to get a
transmitter on Sawachika!

346
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,250
You've got to use your computer
to track her location for us!

347
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,375
We'll come back for you
after we've finished her off!

348
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,750
Uh... there she is...!
She's running past 1-F!

349
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,000
Copy that!

350
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,458
Man... this is
looking pretty bad...

351
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,708
they just seem
to keep on coming!

352
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,791
I'm sure Hanai
will be here soon...

353
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,250
Just hang on!

354
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,458
If we could just move the
barricade forward a little,

355
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,166
we might be able to
hold them off long enough

356
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,583
for Hanai to get here...

357
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,583
Make the coffee shop a good one.

358
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,000
Huh?

359
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,000
Misawa!!

360
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,875
Nice one, Misawa!

361
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,750
Misawa...! No...
Please, just get up!

362
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,291
Noooooooo!!!

363
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,291
That Sawachika is
pretty hardcore, huh?

364
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,958
Oh no...! Why?!

365
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,083
Now we've got her...

366
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,208
We should be able to
run her down pretty quick.

367
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,250
That's strange...

368
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,166
She's showing
herself too much...

369
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,583
I wonder...
Could this be a trap?

370
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,750
She's gone into 2-C!

371
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,041
Right... we end it here.

372
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,250
You fell for the
dummy, sweetheart!

373
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,583
Now here's a taste of
the real deal, Sawachika!

374
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,916
Huh...? What?

375
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,958
Nagayama...! You said
room 2-C, didn't you?

376
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,708
What the hell is going on?

377
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,333
Something's not right, check
her location for us again!

378
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,875
Look, I already checked it!

379
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm telling you, she's in 2-C!

380
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,125
And I'm telling you we're
in 2-C and she's not here.

381
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,708
Are you sure she hasn't
changed position?

382
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,875
Yes I'm sure!

383
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,625
She's there,
I'm looking at it right now!

384
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,625
For amateurs...
you did very well.

385
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,750
And now allow me
to give you... your reward.

386
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,458
Gross.

387
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,541
Did you enjoy watching
Miss Eri's adventures?

388
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,666
Next time I believe her exploits
will be even more exciting.

389
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,166
What? Don't be silly.

390
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,333
I'm just a humble butler.

391
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,250
I couldn't possibly do that.
