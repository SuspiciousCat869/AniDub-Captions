1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:18,708
Tenma Tsukamoto...
Half human, half machine.

2
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,541
Sis! Hey Sis!

3
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,000
Today's the Dozibiron
off line party...!

4
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,333
You haven't forgotten, have you?

5
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,708
Huh...? A party?

6
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, I did forget.

7
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,041
Sorry, Sis is tired
out from work,

8
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,250
so could you let me sleep today?

9
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,333
All right then...
suit yourself...

10
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll just play with
my Internet friend.

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,208
Wait, you mean he's
actually coming over?

12
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,708
I'm the chat room moderator...

13
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,625
They all want a
piece of this, yo!

14
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,833
Grade school kids are really
something these days.

15
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,458
I don't want none,
I don't want none...

16
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,125
Wah! Boom!

17
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm surprised you'd get together

18
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,666
with someone you only
know from the net...

19
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,875
what if some weirdo comes over?

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,416
But this is Dozibiron Blue,

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
the kid I chat with
all the freakin' time.

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,250
Oh, that's right, the
boy you like so much...

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,375
How old is this guy?

24
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,541
His spelling is pretty bad,

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,625
my guess is he's a
little younger than me.

26
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,041
Well... okay then...

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,500
But try to play quietly.

28
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,916
Okay, we will.

29
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,208
I'm going to sleep now.

30
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,833
All right.

31
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,125
Yes?

32
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,791
I... Imadori?

33
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, Itchy... would you like
to go out on a date with me?

34
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,541
Oh... oh my...
so many... feelings ...

35
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,125
are you sure you'd
settle for a girl like me?

36
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,750
Itchy...

37
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,000
I mean... Karen... it looks
like I've given in to you.

38
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,208
Huh?!

39
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,791
Not bad... take this!

40
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,041
Whoa, nice one!
Now let me see...

41
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,125
what should I try next...?

42
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,458
Too late, Blue,
you lost this one!

43
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,750
It figures that's
what I'd dream about.

44
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,458
But I have to say
it was a nice one.

45
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,875
No way! You're
such a sore loser!

46
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,250
My gosh, those two are
making a lot of noise!

47
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,875
Hey...! Turn it down!

48
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,875
Could you use
your inside voices?

49
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,041
Ten four!

50
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,041
Hey Sis, did you sleep well?

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,125
Hm...? your sister?

52
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,333
What the heck is he doing here?!

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,458
That's...
That's Ima, Ima, Ima...

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,000
Dude what's up
with the drama...?

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,708
I mean, This is
just Dozibiron Blue.

56
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,333
So Imadori's the...?!

57
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,375
You said he was
younger than you!

58
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,041
Wait a minute...!
How do you know his name?

59
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,541
How do I... he's in
my class, that's how!

60
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,291
What...?! Someone as
fun as this guy...?

61
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,333
That is so... awesome

62
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,416
Oh, never mind that now!

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,541
Okay?

64
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,833
I-I have to hurry
and go do something!

65
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,416
Like what, Sis?

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,541
Oh, it doesn't matter, I just
have to do something, anything!

67
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,500
Aw...

68
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,166
Ah! The laundry is
all over the place!

69
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,458
So what...? It's just laundry!

70
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,083
Look, give me a hand,
will you, Kosuke?

71
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,958
Hurry and fold them, come on!

72
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,041
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

73
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,625
Hey, Itchy, where's this go?

74
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,250
Oh, that... that goes
down in the bottom drawer.

75
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,875
Wait a minute, what do you
think you're doing, Imadori?!

76
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,625
Oh, I just thought I'd go
ahead and make myself useful.

77
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,375
Hey, Itchy, I gotta say,

78
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,208
I'm surprised you
own something this big.

79
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,041
That belongs to my mom!

80
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,250
Ho-ho! Give my
congratulations to your mother!

81
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,500
I found somebody's jammies!

82
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,750
Ah...! Give me those
back right now!

83
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,541
Itchy, do you really
work out with these things?

84
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,125
They must weigh a ton!

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,791
They're just five kilos each,
that's hardly anything!

86
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,083
Trying to diet down
to under 40 kilos, huh?

87
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,833
Looks like you've almost
made it, hang in there!

88
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, stop it...!
Stop being such a big meanie!

89
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,208
Poor thing...

90
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,750
Little Itchy thinks
Imadori's a big meanie.

91
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't take it anymore!

92
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,250
Come on, Sis,
forget all that crap

93
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,041
and play
Dozibiron with us...!

94
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,875
Then you can be Dozibiron Pink
just like you always are!

95
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,750
Yeah, I bet your sister really
rocks as the Pink Ranger!

96
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,416
Hey...

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,625
I just realized...

98
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,958
I've been a total jerk to you.

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,750
Just relax and be
yourself from now on, okay?

100
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,750
You really mean it?

101
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,416
Okay, I'll play
for a little bit.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,083
All right!!

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,250
Arise!!

104
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,000
And unite!!

105
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,750
Dozibiron!!

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,166
Episode forty-three, "The
Pressure Point Pushing Monster

107
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,375
Ryusan's Hidden Trap During
the Weekend School Trip...

108
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,458
Part Four!"

109
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah!!

110
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,791
Episode forty-three?
I'm impressed!

111
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,041
That one's a classic!
Great choice!

112
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,666
There's nothing as relaxing
as a massage after a hot bath!

113
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,375
Oh, no! Can't move!

114
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,291
Come on, Crewman Kosuke,
you've got to snap out of it!

115
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,708
No good... all of
my body's pressure points

116
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,416
have become paralyzed!

117
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,500
It's your turn next,
Pink Ranger!

118
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,791
Yeah...! Now this is
where Ryusan attacks!

119
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,208
Soon you'll be as helpless
as your crewmate!

120
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,500
I'll rub you down!!

121
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,833
What are you gonna do, Karen?!

122
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,041
No, you don't!

123
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,666
Take this...! Invincible Hammer!

124
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
Not bad, Dozibiron!

125
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,166
Not bad yourself, Ryusan!

126
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,083
Hey Dozibiron Blue!

127
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,750
I bet if you sang
the theme song...

128
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,541
Dozibiron Pink would
show you her bra!

129
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,333
Impressive! But I'm
not showing you my bra!

130
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm really sorry if I made
too much of a fuss today.

131
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,458
But... if you can maybe give
me a little advance notice...

132
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,916
next time I can have everything
ready when you come over.

133
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,000
Come back soon, Blue!

134
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,000
Hey... you can count
on it, Kosuke...!

135
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,041
Now don't give your sister
a hard time, all right?

136
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,250
Whatev!

137
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,625
Whaddaya think, Sis...?

138
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,750
Maybe you and Blue
should hook it up...! Ah!

139
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:59,250
Just kidding...! Huh?

140
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,166
Hey, look...

141
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
Isn't this the mask that
Blue brought over with him?

142
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,166
Huh...? I could've
sworn I saw him

143
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,291
put that thing in
his pocket earlier.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,208
There, that takes care of
the exposure and the angle...

145
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,625
The settings are all finished.

146
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,666
All you have to do is
point the camera and click.

147
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,083
Thanks a lot...

148
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,416
for coming in on
the break and all.

149
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,541
Hey, it's no big deal,
anything to help out

150
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
a fellow band member, right?

151
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,916
Wow, it's getting chilly...

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,916
you should head back
inside, Tsumugi.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,125
I don't really mind...

154
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,333
I mean, this is my only chance

155
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,000
to relax and just
look at the stars.

156
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,458
Just think, next year
we're gonna be juniors...

157
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,625
are you planning on sticking
with your astronomy studies?

158
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:58,625
I'm not really sure...
I'm taking liberal arts.

159
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,666
I see.

160
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,916
Wow, it's cold!

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,625
You guys must be freezing...

162
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,541
I brought some food at least.

163
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,625
Oh, wasn't expecting
you to be here, Fuyuki.

164
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,916
I asked him to stop by
and give us a hand.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,208
Okay.

166
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,291
Come on, everyone, let's eat!

167
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,958
Generous as always, Megumi!

168
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,791
It's one of the perks
of having a family

169
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,875
in the restaurant biz... Ta-da!

170
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,458
Okay, now that
we're all warmed up...

171
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,375
Let's talk about all
this year's love gossip!

172
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,666
Oh, come on, what do
we have to do that for?

173
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,250
Oh, please... we're three
teenage girls, we're together,

174
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,458
it's the end of the school year,

175
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,000
what else would we talk about?

176
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,833
Hey, there's a guy
here too ya know...

177
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,000
They're not listening.

178
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,291
Well, you go first.
What have you got?

179
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,083
Oh good... 'bout time you
weren't so awkward about it.

180
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,500
As it turns out, this year there

181
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,833
were ten couples that got
together... A new record!

182
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,666
I can't believe you
remembered all of them.

183
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,250
Gosh you never change.

184
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,791
That makes us even,
you never change either!

185
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416
I'm as boring as ever.

186
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,875
Oh, you're right.

187
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,208
I mean, a whole year has gone by

188
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,375
and I haven't done anything!

189
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,000
OMG I was so JKing...!

190
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,958
I think you accomplished
a lot this year!

191
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,166
I mean...

192
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,416
you sang in front of
Imadori, you invited him

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,333
to your house,
that's like totally huge!

194
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,291
I didn't invite him over, it was
my little brother, he did it!

195
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,041
The point is, you did a lot
this year, so take it easy

196
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,375
So how did your year go, Yuki?

197
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,708
Hm?

198
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,541
Oh, my year...
was nothing special.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,708
Between stargazing...

200
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,958
and watching
Karen here blossom...

201
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,916
I've managed to
keep pretty busy.

202
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,625
Okay, I'm starting
to get cold again...

203
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,666
tell you what, I'll get some
coffee... you wanna come?

204
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,916
Freeze, boy!

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,583
Why not let Karen
and me get the coffee?

206
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,083
You two stay here, okay...?
Just enjoy the snow.

207
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,458
Couple number eleven
coming right up!

208
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,666
Looks like they've got
the wrong idea about us.

209
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,708
Really...? It doesn't seem
like too bad an idea to me.

210
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,916
Mm-mm... no thanks.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,083
No? Why not?

212
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,791
I don't go for guys
who are overconfident.

213
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,583
Okay, maybe
I am a little forward,

214
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,833
but inside I'm just
a delicate flower.

215
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,083
Most guys who act
overconfident are.

216
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,208
You're loud and obnoxious,
begging for attention,

217
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,083
but as soon as someone figures
you out you get all awkward.

218
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,666
Awkward...?
I'm so not awkward...

219
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,125
I mean, really, don't you
think that's kinda harsh?

220
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,583
Sorry but I'm
tired of being seen

221
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,416
as the quiet girl who
never speaks her mind.

222
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,500
Something's different
about you today.

223
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,000
What? What're you talking about?

224
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,458
You're in love aren't you?

225
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,291
That's why you
look so beautiful.

226
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,291
Shut up. Don't try to feed
me one of your stupid lines.

227
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,458
I'm not falling for it.

228
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,958
No. I'm serious!

229
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,458
Women in love have a
certain radiance about them.

230
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,333
Sometimes I think I'm
the only one who sees it.

231
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,500
Is that why you're
a photographer?

232
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,291
I wish I could
capture it on film...

233
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
but somehow it always
seems to escape me.

234
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,541
Still, I'm pretty lucky...

235
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,166
I get to see a
whole world of beauty

236
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,625
that most ordinary people don't
even realize is out there.

237
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
Like you, today...

238
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,708
I can see it in your eyes.

239
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,250
It's like they're
on fire with passion.

240
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,125
Word of advice...

241
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,375
Don't ever try to become a poet.

242
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,000
Would you stop it?!

243
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,958
Oh, come on,
you know you want some!

244
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,166
Here, try it!

245
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,208
Hey!

246
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,375
Hey... there's the first star.

247
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,708
Um... pretty sure
those are clouds.

248
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,416
Hey... so what do you think

249
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,208
of the new guy they
made division chief?

250
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,916
Oh... um... well, I...

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,083
Pretty good looking, I'd say.

252
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,375
Beats the old pervert
we had before.

253
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,875
He smelled like soup and death.

254
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,958
Needs a little work in the
wardrobe department, though.

255
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,333
He wears nothing but black.

256
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,708
Yeah, it's weird.

257
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,875
Think maybe it's some
kind of political statement?

258
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,708
What? You guys have
a problem with black?

259
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,708
Ah-ha...

260
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,041
What is it?

261
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,250
Nothing.

262
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,000
Tenma...! Could this
be love at first sight?

263
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,500
No! Don't listen, she lies!

264
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,500
Filling out forms
sure is thirsty work.

265
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm gonna go make
some tea! See ya!

266
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,833
Wow. Bipolar much?

267
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't like that girl.

268
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
Why?

269
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,916
She's got a lot of
nerve for a new kid...

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,958
I mean, kissing up
to the boss like that?

271
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,125
How 'bout we welcome her

272
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,833
to Cybo-Div - Old School style.

273
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,458
I'm Tenma Tsukamoto,
the new girl

274
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,958
in Cyber Division,
or "Cybo-Div"...

275
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,916
They still don't let me
do much more than make tea,

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,583
but with this high-priced
gourmet, organically grown tea,

277
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,333
I'm gonna win
Chief Karasuma's heart!

278
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,125
Hot stuff coming through!

279
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,708
 The truth is...

280
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,458
I don't have any memories
before six months ago.

281
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,916
I have what they call amnesia.

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,291
When I was down and out,

283
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,250
and all alone with
no one to turn to,

284
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,625
it was Big Sister Yakumo who
held out a helping hand to me.

285
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,958
I call her "Big Sister" because
she's so mature and beautiful...

286
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,166
she must be older than me.

287
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,291
This is the stuck
up princess, Eri...

288
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,333
And Mikoto.
She's got a great rack...

289
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,791
And the boyishly handsome Akira,

290
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,750
I'd so do her in that uniform.

291
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,333
We work hard, and they're
a great team to be on!

292
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,708
Who's this again?

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,125
Hey there, Chief... how
would you like to join me

294
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,666
for a private candlelight
dinner and hotel tonight?

295
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,166
I spilled the tea!

296
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,583
Huh...! Looks like you'd
better make more, honey...

297
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,458
And bring me a cup too.

298
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,666
Yes, Miss Eri...

299
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,750
Just because she's
got a little money

300
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,500
she thinks she
can lord it over me?

301
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,666
Wait! What in the
world came over me?

302
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,166
Never mind...!
This time the chief

303
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,666
will drink my special
tea of love for sure!

304
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,208
Chief Karasuma,
Miss Eri... your tea is ready!

305
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:35,750
Excuse me, Chief... how do
I fill out this big long form?

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,041
She thinks she's all that
'cause she's got boobs

307
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,416
big enough to have
their own address!

308
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Take... that...! and that!

309
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,416
Not again...! What's the deal?

310
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,041
Could something in my
mysterious past be causing this?

311
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,083
Nah, that's crazy talk!

312
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,000
Now to get out there
and serve that tea!

313
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,916
All right, everyone...

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,333
ready to have your
mind blown by my tea?

315
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,041
Big Sister Yakumo!

316
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,750
You too? I trusted you!

317
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,375
Sorry, but it's tradition...

318
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,375
I don't want to,
but I have to do it.

319
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,625
See, this is sort of a
rookie welcoming party.

320
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,750
What...? Welcoming party...

321
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,750
Wait...! Tenma!

322
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,291
This must be that famous
Cybo-Div rookie hazing

323
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,916
I've heard about!

324
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,583
Wow... Tenma's tea is so... hot.

325
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,541
Do you want one?

326
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,416
Huh?

327
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,541
A Cybo-Div welcoming party?

328
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you talkin' about?

329
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,416
I'm your superior officer!

330
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,791
You're members
of Cyborg Division,

331
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,250
not some college sorority!

332
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,416
Act like it!

333
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
You don't have to yell...

334
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,333
Ichijou!

335
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,458
You made her cry!!

336
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,875
You bastard!

337
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,916
You gotta lotta nerve pickin'
on my beloved Tenma...!

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,291
No way are you gonna
get away with that!

339
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,000
I wasn't lookin'
at you, Blondie!

340
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,583
Lara, for heaven's sake,

341
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,083
let him go he's starting
to foam at the mouth!

342
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,125
What's wrong?

343
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,166
Akira.

344
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,166
Hey there.

345
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,125
I see... so that's the problem.

346
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,500
I'm just a stupid, clumsy ox!

347
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:37,458
Hey now, come on, that doesn't
sound like the Tenma I know.

348
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,291
The Tenma I know is always
cheerful and positive...

349
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,875
and always brightens a
room by leaving a little bit

350
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,333
of that cheer with
everyone she meets.

351
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,541
I wish... it's all just an act.

352
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,833
Act or not, the fact
is you really do make

353
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,666
everyone feel a little bit
better for having known you.

354
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,875
Ya see?

355
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,750
Big Sister Yakumo... Hey, girls!

356
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,791
Oh, Tenma, we're so sorry.

357
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah, we only meant
it as a little joke...

358
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,041
We feel really bad...
Come on, Eri, you too.

359
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,625
It's... Whatever...
I'm... I'm like sorry n'stuff.

360
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,250
Oh, gosh... look at me...

361
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,708
I'm gonna get all weepy,
I just know it...

362
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,333
Yes... up until then...

363
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,958
things were peaceful...

364
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,541
but I had something
important I had to tell her...

365
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,333
even if it meant destroying
this time of happiness.

366
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,375
Miss Tsukamoto.

367
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,916
Chief Karasuma!

368
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,916
There's something
important I have to tell you.

369
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,916
Why, that lousy creep!

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,291
I could... I could kill that
jerk...! What's he sayin'?!

371
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,541
Chief Harima...!

372
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,208
Mind your own business
and get back to work!

373
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,666
Shut up...! I'm sick
of your bullsh--!

374
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,250
What the hell is going on?

375
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,958
Network security
has been compromised!

376
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
System crash is
like so imminent!

377
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,166
All right... let's hit it!

378
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,750
Cyber!!!

379
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,708
Hold on, pal...!
That's my division!

380
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:23,875
Sound off.

381
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:24,208
One!

382
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:24,583
Two!

383
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:24,958
Three!

384
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,333
Four!

385
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:25,666
Five!

386
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,041
Six!

387
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:26,583
Seven!

388
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,250
One more time.

389
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:27,583
One!

390
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:27,958
Two!

391
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:28,333
Three!

392
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:28,708
Four!

393
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,125
Five!

394
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:29,625
And six!

395
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,958
Seven!

396
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,708
There is an unprecedented
danger approaching us...

397
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,250
you are the only ones with
any hope of saving us...

398
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,375
now move out!

399
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,583
Cyber!!

400
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,125
I keep telling you
this is my division!

401
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,416
We meet again, Cybo-Div!

402
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,666
Doctor Hanai!

403
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,250
You are all doomed...!
Today I delete you...!

404
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,250
Attack...! Go forth,
precious drones!

405
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,875
Hey...! Getcher
stinger outta there!!

406
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,708
This whole "bees with grabby
hands" thing is getting awkward!

407
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,708
Please, make it stop!

408
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,666
Bring it on!

409
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,458
No...! You guys...

410
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,708
Cadet Tsukamoto...

411
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,333
Avenge our deaths...

412
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,083
Don't let this be in vain...

413
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,458
Don't give up...

414
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:22,125
We all... really liked you,
please believe that...

415
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,416
Tenma!!

416
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,958
I will carry on the
fight for all of you...

417
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,833
Our enemies will
be shown no mercy.

418
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,291
Just a moment, Miss Tsukamoto!

419
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,458
There's one thing
I have to tell you...

420
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,958
before the battle.

421
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,208
Is this some dark secret
from my forgotten past?

422
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,583
You're wearing mismatched socks.

423
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,541
Oh, no...! How long
has it been like that?!

424
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,833
Then what could've happened
in her past that...?

425
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,208
Don't tell me it
was the time that...

426
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
I wanna go home...! Doowah!

427
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,833
Come on...! You're a
scientifically modified

428
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,041
and enhanced human being...!
Stop being childish!

429
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,375
She's scientifically hot...

430
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,166
Oh yeah!

431
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,125
I wonder if that could
be what caused her amnesia!

432
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,458
You got it!

433
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,666
And... due to my
genius modifications,

434
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,250
she was unharmed by the bus!

435
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,000
Of course, she did go
missing after that...

436
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You're gonna pay.

437
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,458
Uh... What's that?

438
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,000
I said you're gonna pay!

439
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,583
You'll be sorry you did this...!

440
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,708
You've violated the
purity of a maiden's heart!

441
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,333
Tenma's internal maiden
circuits are activated

442
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,833
which means we're
f@#!ed, and the thing

443
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,666
in the basement
is like, coming out.

444
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,708
It's happened...

445
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,166
the time has come.

446
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,833
You're up, big guy.

447
00:21:55,541 --> 00:22:02,541
♪ ending song ♪

448
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,333
Oh, come on!

449
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,500
You can't have
more shopping to do!

450
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,750
Sorry, but that's
just how it goes!

451
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,208
Aw, somebody lost their toy.

452
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,000
What is that thing?

453
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,958
I don't know... But I
kinda feel sorry for it.

454
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,083
There. All right!
One more store to hit!

455
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,333
You could carry some
of this, you know!

456
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,666
Let's eat some noodles...
Let's eat some noodles...

457
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,208
I don't want none...
I don't want none...

458
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,791
Yakumo! Aren't the
soba noodles done yet?

459
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,375
The "Three for the
Kill" big year end special

460
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,833
is about to start!

461
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,041
Here! They're all done, Sis!

462
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,833
This is why I love
New Year's Eve.

463
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,583
Soba noodles! Soba noodles!
Come on, Yakumo!

464
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,875
Soba noodles!
Soba noodles! Soba noodles!
