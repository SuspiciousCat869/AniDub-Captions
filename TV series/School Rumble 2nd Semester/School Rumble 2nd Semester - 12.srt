Tenma... Tenma... Tenma!

9
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,708
Eri?

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,208
I'm in big trouble...!

11
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,125
I need a favor and you're the
only one who can help me!

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,458
Tenma? Who's that...? Huh?!

13
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,791
Hey...! Hold on! Have
I always been this tall?!

14
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,166
For some reason,

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,791
Tenma was a hundred and
sixty-five centimeters tall.

16
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm sorry to bother you, Tenma,

17
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,625
but I can't find my textbook,
and without it, I can't study.

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,458
I would buy a new one,
but I lost my wallet, too...

19
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,250
And I have to take
big exam tomorrow...

20
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,375
Why do I have to
be such a loser?

21
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,958
Don't worry. I'll give you mine.

22
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,875
Huh?!

23
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,166
But then you won't
be able to study...

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,916
No... it's all right, 'cause...

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've already memorized
the entire book.

26
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,166
Thank you so much, Tenma!

27
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,541
It's okay...

28
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,458
You should always help
out when a friend's in need.

29
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,500
Tenma! Help!

30
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,041
Uh! Akira?! Mikoto?!

31
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,208
You shouldn't run in the hall!

32
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,833
This math problem is so hard,
we can't figure it out...!

33
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,000
And we're going to be
held back if we don't!

34
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,375
Help, you genius!

35
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,375
Let's see here.
You're right. It is a doozy...

36
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,625
But if you just do this...

37
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,541
Voila!

38
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,125
Thanks, Tenma...!
We knew that you could do it!

39
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,708
We'll never forget
what you've done for us.

40
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,458
It's all right...

41
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,833
Let's all pass math together!

42
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:17,208
For some reason, Tenma's IQ was
also a hundred and sixty-five.

43
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,291
Shoot!

44
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,041
For some reason,
Tenma's jump was also

45
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,500
a hundred and
sixty-five centimeters.

46
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,583
Duwa!

47
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,041
For some reason,
Tenma also had a hundred

48
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,333
and sixty-five
wrestling wins in a row.

49
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,750
Thank Heaven, thank heaven,

50
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,166
'cause heaven sent
Tenma to you all...

51
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,916
For some reason,
Tenma also scored

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
a hundred and
sixty-five points at karaoke.

53
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,583
Hey, guys, look...!
It's Tsukamoto!

54
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,708
Oh my god! It's Tenma!

55
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,708
I love you!

56
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,000
She's so gorgeous!

57
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,916
Seeing her is a great
way to start the day!

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
Tenma! Look over here!

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,583
Hey! Quit pushing!

60
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,041
Tenma, can we
have your autograph?!

61
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,791
Sure thing... But one at a time.

62
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,666
My goodness! Please,
take it easy everybody!

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,958
She's as popular as ever, huh?

64
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,750
Yep, but she's different.
She's not stuck-up.

65
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,375
It's nice that
someone as popular

66
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,416
as her hangs out
with people like us.

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,666
Um, Tenma...? Will you please
go out on a date with me?

68
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,125
Hey, I was here first...!
Go out with me instead!

69
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,208
Forget you losers!

70
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,958
I'm the only one
who can make her happy!

71
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,833
Oh, wow, thanks,
guys, all of you... But...

72
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,541
Sorry, my heart is already
set on someone else!

73
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,333
For some reason,
Tenma also turned down

74
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,333
a hundred and sixty-five boys.

75
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,333
Dammit! Who the hell is it?!

76
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,833
Yeah! Who's the guy
that Tenma loves so much?!

77
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,916
My reason for living is gone!

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,666
Boy, Tenma, you
sure are popular.

79
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,625
Everything you do is perfect.

80
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,083
I wish I could be like you.

81
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,791
Hey, don't talk
like that, Eri...

82
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,833
You're terrific too, girl!

83
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,333
What a pickle.

84
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:04,166
Everyone seems to really like
me, and that makes me happy.

85
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,083
But what about him?
The boy that I really like?

86
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,666
Miss Tsukamoto...

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,500
Who is it? What's the matter?
You look so serious.

88
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,791
Listen, there's something
important I need to tell you.

89
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
I love you.

90
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,500
Wait, that can't be true... No!

91
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,250
Harima, I thought you
had feelings for Yakumo--

92
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,166
I don't... Since I met you...

93
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,208
You're the only one I've loved!

94
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,916
Tenma... Go out with me.

95
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,166
It was just a dream?!

96
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh, why would
I have one like that?

97
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,833
It was so weird... and silly.

98
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,666
But still...

99
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,708
Tenma... Go out with me.

100
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,625
I was surprised to
hear Harima say that...

101
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,625
Hey, Tsukamoto.

102
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,125
Uh...?

103
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:18,291
Huh...? What the--...?!
W-what's going on?!

104
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,916
Why's my heart beating so fast?!

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,708
You okay? You're red.

106
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,791
What's wrong...?

107
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,250
You got a fever or somethin'?

108
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,666
Um... Hey, Harima...?

109
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,916
Yeah?

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,958
Um... We need to talk...

111
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
Sure... 'Bout what?

112
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,833
Oh, look, I, I don't
know exactly why, but--

113
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,125
Oh, Harima, I--

114
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,458
Tenma, you gotta say,
"I love you!"

115
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,708
You have to make the alien eat
a snow cone before it rains.

116
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,833
Let's dig in!

117
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,416
Sis, I forgot to ask...

118
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,333
Did your studying go well today?

119
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,833
Nope, I fell asleep...!
There's always tomorrow!

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
Come on, guys, tomorrow's
my freakin' birthday...!

121
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,583
I wanted to rock out
with my socks out.

122
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,208
Paint the town red, you know...?

123
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,708
But now Yakumo's gotta
go to work even though

124
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,541
it's a school holiday
and we've got the day off...

125
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,541
Yeah, and I've got a
previous commitment tomorrow

126
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,583
and there's no way
I can get out of it.

127
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,166
Sorry, Tenma...

128
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,125
But I already promised I would
help out at the dojo tomorrow...

129
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,041
Besides, we have
exams coming up.

130
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,458
Hm...?! Are you saying
that stupid tests

131
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,250
are more important
than my birthday?!

132
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,750
Look, once this term is over,

133
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,750
we'll throw you a
belated birthday bash.

134
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, really?

135
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,208
I'm tellin' you, girl...
Party of the century!

136
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,125
Wait a minute!

137
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,583
You mean I'm the only person

138
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,125
who's going to be
able to celebrate

139
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,625
with lonely little
Tenma on her birthday?

140
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,291
Happy Birthday.

141
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,333
Harima...

142
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,500
Sorry. I know I'm
probably not the person

143
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,375
you wanted to hear this from...

144
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,375
No, I'm happy...

145
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,583
In fact, I'm happier to
hear it from you, Harima,

146
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,208
than I am from Eri and the
rest of my so-called friends...

147
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,125
Tenma!

148
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay!

149
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,125
Now if I just casually work it

150
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,750
in that my birthday
is the day after,

151
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,666
then that can only
lead to one thing!

152
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,916
I wanted to wish you a happy
birthday in person, Harima!

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,583
Say, how about the two of us go
celebrate on our own right now?

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,333
Okay, what's the
deal with Harima?

155
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,875
He's looks constipated.

156
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay, gotta get a plan
together for tomorrow...

157
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,000
First thing's first...

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,125
Move out...

159
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,708
Asleep... However...

160
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,708
Just as I thought.

161
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,541
The eagle has been spotted.

162
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,666
Curry? Awesome!

163
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,416
And just as I was
getting hungry, too.

164
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,083
Can't... believe
I fell for that!

165
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,291
After all that
I think I deserve this.

166
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,250
Oh, you silly little boy,

167
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,833
Always chasing
after silly girls,

168
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,041
Hoping that they love you,

169
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,083
Just as much as you love them,

170
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,958
But the thing is that you're
really lame...

171
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,416
Man, she really
went all out, huh?

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,250
I have to hand it to her...

173
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,791
Things I saw in there...
were horrifying...

174
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,666
That cat... But none
of that matters now!

175
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,125
With the information
in this magazine

176
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,208
I'll plan the best date ever...!

177
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,041
Nothing can stand in my way.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,625
Gotta make her
think I'm a classy guy,

179
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,000
so I'll start by showing her
the famous sightseeing spots

180
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,958
of Tonarimachi, and then...

181
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,791
Morinoyakata, the western
cuisine restaurant!

182
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,000
That joint's pretty pricy...

183
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,333
but I'll bet anything it'll
really impress Tenma.

184
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,166
I'll just use the thirty
thousand yen

185
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,041
I've been saving up
for a new bike.

186
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,291
I'd be an idiot not
to spend it on her!

187
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:50,000
Now all I've gotta do is
think of how to invite her...

188
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,250
Yo, Big Brother!

189
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,666
I was thinking, 'cause today
is my birthday an' all...

190
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,125
Whoopty freakin' doo!

191
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,250
You should take me somewhere...

192
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,041
Then again,
it might get kinda boring

193
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,958
if it's just the two of us...

194
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,875
I know...! You should invite
some of your friends!

195
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,666
We could all have
a fun time together!

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,916
Like... I don't know.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,666
Maybe that cute
Tsukamoto girl for example!

198
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,208
Shuji!

199
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, yeah...

200
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,125
Oh, yeah...

201
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,541
Yeah...

202
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,208
Hi, Harima!

203
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,708
Sorry to make you wait!

204
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,333
Yo.

205
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,166
Oh, look who's here...

206
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
The little sassy boy
from way back when...

207
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,791
Remember, you still owe
me for room and board.

208
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,833
Shut up! I don't remember
you doing anything for me...!

209
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,583
I just wanted Yaku-- 

210
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,833
He's glad you could make it.

211
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,875
Are you crazy?!

212
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,708
This guy... What a joker.

213
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,041
He asked me to
specifically invite you, Tenma,

214
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,333
to come celebrate
his birthday with us.

215
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,208
Yeah...?! That's so sweet!

216
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,666
Aren't you just precious?

217
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,583
No...!

218
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,541
That Shuji. He's
a regular comedian.

219
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,583
Is that so?

220
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,375
Hey, guys, look!

221
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,958
There's a neat lighthouse
out there, Shuji!

222
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,875
Do you know a lot
about Tonarimachi?

223
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,666
What's the matter?

224
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,666
Does that surprise you...?

225
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,208
Don't let my
appearance fool you.

226
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,291
I am quite the scholar of
scenic and historic sites.

227
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,958
I might teach you
a thing or two today.

228
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:29,166
This shrine is what I like
to call a solitary beauty.

229
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,250
Ooh! This is gonna
be great, Shuji!

230
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,416
That... That's all there is...?

231
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,250
There's nothing else to see?

232
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,041
How stupid... This is no
"solitary beauty".

233
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,583
It's just some deserted temple.

234
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,250
Hey! Shut your mouth...!

235
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,750
The next place
will be spectacular!

236
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,583
This is the famous
Hasegawa Temple.

237
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,250
Its rear gardens are brimming

238
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,708
with crimson leaves
this time of year...

239
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,375
Plus you can see the ocean.
It's quite a dramatic view.

240
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,875
Wow! I can't wait to see it!

241
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,083
Don't worry, you will.

242
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,125
Just hold your horses.

243
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,875
We've gotta pay
the admission first.

244
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,583
Sorry, we're closed for the day.

245
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,375
So... try coming
back when we're open.

246
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,791
Dramatic view, huh?

247
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,833
Yeah, right. There's
nothin' dramatic about it.

248
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,208
More like traumatic,
if ya ask me.

249
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,625
Nicely put, but just
think how disappointing

250
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,708
this would be if
it were a real date.

251
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,208
Oh yeah, right.

252
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,541
It'd be like going
out with some guy

253
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,000
who just threw a plan
together the night before.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,541
Hey, some guys actually do that,

255
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,458
then think everything'll
work itself out.

256
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,541
Are you serious?

257
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,291
Wow, those guys
have to be really dumb.

258
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,500
Dammit! Just because
they're along for the ride,

259
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
they think they can
say anything they want!

260
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,000
This could get bad
if they keep it up.

261
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,208
That was too bad, huh?

262
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,916
Tenma!

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,041
She knows I'm a pathetic loser!

264
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,500
It's too bad you're
such a lame-o!

265
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,083
Damn! I can't even
bring a smile to the face

266
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,875
of the girl
I love on her birthday!

267
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,916
Why are we even celebrating?!

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,416
Only got one chance: dinner!

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,125
Gotta hang in there!

270
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,041
Big Bro? Are we even close to

271
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,250
that restaurant you
were talking about?

272
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,458
Do you know where you're going?

273
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,000
Harima, you're
not lost, are you?

274
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,500
Uh... no... I'm not lost.

275
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:38,208
It is this way, right?

276
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,250
See... Told ya so.

277
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,833
This is really it...? It looks
expensive if you ask me.

278
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,666
Yeah... So what?

279
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,541
No training wear,
sandals, or shorts allowed.

280
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,916
Interesting...

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,541
So... Can you afford a
place that has a dress code?

282
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,375
Can you?

283
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,916
Of course I can
afford it...! Let's go!

284
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
Wow...

285
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,250
We still haven't reached
the entrance yet, huh?

286
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,625
Good evening.

287
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,875
Uh... Right.

288
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,333
Whoa...! This is such
a fancy restaurant!

289
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,666
Big brother...?

290
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,875
It's a nice place and all,

291
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,291
but are you sure you
can afford it...? Hello?

292
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,750
Huh?

293
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,166
Uh, yeah, no problem.

294
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,750
I actually come here,
uh, all the time.

295
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,000
Your menu, sir.

296
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,458
Oh, thank you.

297
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,208
Hmm, let's see...

298
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,833
Tens, hundreds, thousands,
tens of thousands!

299
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:21,458
Tens and tens and tens
and tens of thousands!

300
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,833
So... much... money.

301
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,541
Uh, on second thought...

302
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,541
What a variety!

303
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,125
Even all the names
sound delicious...!

304
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,291
I don't know how
I can possibly choose!

305
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,791
I can't do it!

306
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:38,208
I can't admit I don't have
enough money in front of Tenma!

307
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,625
Not now! Just look
how happy she is!

308
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,791
Now you, sir...?
What can I get you?

309
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,125
Uh... right... A water...

310
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,125
Hm...? So...
four mineral waters.

311
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,375
Will be you be ordering
anything else this evening?

312
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,791
Uh! Yeah, of course.

313
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,583
Uh, we'll take four of your
Chef's Specials, please.

314
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,916
Very good, sir.

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Now please allow us to
show you to your table...

316
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,958
How nice.

317
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,166
Thanks you very much!

318
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,916
Didya see...? They pulled
our chairs out for us!

319
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,875
Routine.

320
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,875
Really...? You think so...?

321
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,666
Wasn't that amazing, Harima?

322
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,208
Uh... yeah sure was.

323
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,333
Wow...! This looks delicious!

324
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,625
Time to masticate.

325
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,333
Big Bro...

326
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,208
It's... delicious...
So delicious.

327
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,041
Are you crying?

328
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,083
No...

329
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,583
I love it...!
I mean, this food...

330
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,041
It's the best I've ever had!

331
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,708
Harima, thank you!

332
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,541
Yeah... of course...
it's no problem.

333
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,333
So you claim.

334
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,125
Oh, man! I'm way over budget!

335
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,375
I can't even afford

336
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,041
whatever the hell it is
we're eating right now!

337
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,208
Another steak!

338
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,333
Huh?!

339
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,250
One more, plea--!

340
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,541
Whoa...! Hold on there!

341
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,041
I'll take another, too!

342
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,000
If that's okay
with you, Harima...

343
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,000
They're delicious!

344
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,708
Yeah, yeah...

345
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,708
Have as much steak as ya like...

346
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,833
All right, then...

347
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,625
Shuji boy, why don't
we have a contest

348
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,291
to see who can eat the most?

349
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,208
You're on...!
I'll kick your ass!

350
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,583
Another! Another! Another!

351
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,458
Another! Another!

352
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,750
I hope you saved
room for dessert.

353
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,958
Oh, wow! Look at all
the different choices!

354
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
Which one of them can we get?

355
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
Choose whatever you like.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,250
If dessert's here...

357
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
Then it's almost over...

358
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:33,041
Let's see, thirty-four thousand
per person, times four,

359
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,166
that's one hundred
and thirty-six thousand!

360
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,416
I don't have enough!

361
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,083
I'm short by over
a hundred thousand!

362
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,583
The autumn leaves turned a
little late this year.

363
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,791
I agree, but they did look
positively resplendent

364
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,333
around two weeks ago.

365
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:50,250
Damn! Rich people talk about
the dumbest things, don't they?!

366
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,541
Pardon me...

367
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,625
Are you ready for
the check now, sir?

368
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, crap.

369
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,958
What do I do...?

370
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,708
Uh, maybe if I talk rich,
he'll think I'm rich.

371
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,708
So uh... I really like leaves.

372
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:03,916
Sir?

373
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,416
I'm just sayin' that
leaves are like positive

374
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,291
and resplendent
sometimes, y'know?

375
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,291
Sorry?

376
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,041
I, uh... I meant
that autumn leaves

377
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,708
sure are pretty, aren't they?

378
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,791
Crap! He's getting suspicious!

379
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,291
Could you show me
where the restroom is?

380
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,458
Right this way, sir.

381
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,458
It's no use.
I'm so sorry, Tenma.

382
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,833
I guess I'm gonna see that
sad look on your face again.

383
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,583
The check...

384
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,791
Huh?

385
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,125
You see... I, uh...

386
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,916
Add this gentleman's
check to mine.

387
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,208
His dinner's on me.

388
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,166
Rich Girl...

389
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,166
Well, well, Miss Sawachika...

390
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,083
And how was your dinner this
evening with Mister Hayashi?

391
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,541
The conversation was boring,

392
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,666
frankly, but the
food was delicious.

393
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,708
Well, I am always
pleased to hear that.

394
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,000
Rich Girl... Why are you here?

395
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,291
You were eating
with Tenma, right...?

396
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,500
Well, you shouldn't keep a
girl waiting on her birthday.

397
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,500
Look, I'm only
doing this for her,

398
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,041
so don't get any ideas...

399
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,208
Now hurry up and
get back to your seat.

400
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,333
Eri! You're here, too?!

401
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,541
Great! Come have
dessert with us!

402
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,708
Oh, Tenma, what a coincidence.

403
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,125
I hope I'm not imposing.

404
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,250
I owe ya.

405
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,041
Thank you, Harima!

406
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,791
Today was so much fun!

407
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,791
Yeah, it was, wasn't it...?

408
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,833
Pretty much perfect!

409
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,666
All right, got her lined up.

410
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,875
No better time than now.

411
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,208
Just tell her tomorrow
is your birthday...

412
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,791
Hey, Tenma, did you
know that tomorrow is my--

413
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,166
To think he did all
of this just for you!

414
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,250
Harima's a nice,
big brother, isn't he?

415
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,416
Yeah!

416
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,708
Yes, indeed.

417
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,916
Moron.

418
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,208
Here it is my birthday,
and I'm all alone.

419
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,250
I can't do anything right.

420
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,541
Ya tryin' to cheer
me up there, Pyotr?

421
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,500
Hey, thanks...

422
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,958
Hey, cut it out.

423
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,250
Yummy Brains...

424
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,541
Ah, well... at least
I got to see Tenma smile.

425
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,125
That's all I needed.

426
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,416
Okay, Pyotr, put me
down. This is weird.

427
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,791
I think I might be sick!
Hey, stop it!

428
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,000
Don't come near me...!

429
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,791
Next time, on School Rumble:

430
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,708
"When I Turned Around,
There He Was.

431
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,291
In Karasuma's Name.x

432
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:06,625
All Mysteries Revealed!" Say,
I think I've seen him before...
