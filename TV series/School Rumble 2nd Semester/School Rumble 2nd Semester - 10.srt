1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,666
Welcome everyone!

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,041
Are you ready to
have fun tonight?!

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,750
Then put your hands
together for the Flying Azteca!

4
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:14,958
Aztec--!

5
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,625
Welcome back Master,
it's good to see you.

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,375
Uh... I... mean, table for two?

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,375
Yakumo...

8
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,083
I just realized that
I've been getting fat!

9
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,708
So that's it! I'm going on a
diet, are you guys with me?

10
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,708
Mikoto...! You're so mean...!

11
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:23,708
I'm not mean!

12
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,708
I'm just... bein' a good friend!

13
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,041
Aw man! Why am I the one
who has to go on a diet?

14
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,041
I mean, really.

15
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,833
You weigh more than I do.

16
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,833
What are you getting
at, Tenma? Hm?

17
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,250
I'm just saying,...

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,166
You know you eat
a lot more than me!

19
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,083
What do you weigh
right now, huh?

20
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,375
That's none of your business!

21
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,083
Besides, I'm a
lot taller than you,

22
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,083
so I'm supposed
to weigh more, okay!

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,791
And I have more muscle too!

24
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,375
Muscle weighs more than fat!

25
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:55,250
Hey! Let's compare and find out
which one of us is the heaviest!

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,958
You have got to be kidding me.

27
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,125
So, Eri, your turn!
How much ya got?

28
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,000
Me? Well, last time I checked.

29
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,333
About 110.

30
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,458
No way! That's not fair!

31
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,791
You're like four
inches taller than me!

32
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,416
I work very hard on my figure
when no one is watching.

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,875
Akira, you never have trouble
with your weight do you?

34
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,625
I bet you can eat
whatever you want.

35
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,000
Well...

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,666
Honestly, I pretty much
starve myself... and vomit.

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583
Stop being ridiculous, Akira.

38
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,916
Listen to me Tenma...

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,625
If you wanna be skinny
just stop eating so much.

40
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,875
Then there's genetics.

41
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,958
I read in a magazine
somewhere, 80% of children

42
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,083
whose parents are
obese will grow up

43
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,416
to be fat no
matter what they do.

44
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,958
I guess I got lucky.
Both my parents are thin.

45
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,791
Great. I guess I'm screwed.

46
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,166
Both my parents are fat.

47
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,875
I think my family is pretty
much on the normal side.

48
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,791
Okay, can we shut up
about this topic?

49
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,083
'Cause I'm seriously over it.

50
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,375
We came here to study, right?

51
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,291
So are we gonna do that or what?

52
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,208
Hey! What the hell
are you doing, Tenma?!

53
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,666
I didn't mean it, how
come you didn't stop me?!

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
Don't blame this on me!

55
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,250
Can we be done with
the self-loathing now?

56
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,000
Of course.

57
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,458
You know you want it.

58
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,541
Why did I take this class?

59
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,708
It's way too hard.

60
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,833
I knew I should've
picked science instead!

61
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,125
I totally would've
been way better at that.

62
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,208
I mean everyone knows I'm
really good at science, right?!

63
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,958
What gave you that idea?

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,541
Everyone knows it's true!

65
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,500
For example,...
eating a cake this thin

66
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,833
is like eating... nothing.

67
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,083
Nothing equals zero calories.

68
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,958
So no matter how
many layers you eat,

69
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,375
it'll always add up to zero.

70
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,458
So, even if I eat this entire
cake, I won't get fat!

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,750
Where did that come from?

72
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't be stupid!

73
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,791
You know you can't eat
that and not get fat!

74
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,666
Well, since it's in front of us,
we might as well share it.

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,916
I mean, if we split it,
we'll be eating fewer calories.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,708
That's Eri for ya!

77
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,291
What a smartie!

78
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,458
So, let's cut it into
three equal pieces...

79
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,666
One for me, and
Akira and Mikoto.

80
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,583
Tenma, you did just
eat an entire parfait.

81
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey, now, wait a sec!

82
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,166
If we were gonna try to
divide this cake into thirds,

83
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,500
there'd be .33333 left.

84
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,458
Well, what happens
to the rest of it?

85
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,416
That's called a differential.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,416
Hey, check it out.

87
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,208
It looks like I lost
some fat and tightened up

88
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,000
from playing so
much basketball lately.

89
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,083
Look at this bicep!

90
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,416
I bet I'm the
strongest guy around!

91
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,208
You've got guts, talking
like that in front of me!

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,875
I say we arm wrestle...

93
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,833
to see whose
muscles are superior.

94
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,083
Let's see how you handle
the "Big Bull of Texas."

95
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,583
Wow... that was random.

96
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,958
Listen, Tougou.
I wasn't really...

97
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,750
Come on.

98
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,250
You think you can hurt me?

99
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,250
Like I'm some pretty boy you
can slap on the ass and say,

100
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,583
"Cook me dinner"?

101
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,083
No, I honestly don't
think of you that way.

102
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,166
But... If you insist...

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,583
Hello? We got a
test to study for.

104
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,500
Too late now.

105
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,416
My muscles are on fire
and they need a fight!

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,958
Cool, I guess we'll all fail.

107
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,166
Are you happy now?

108
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,416
Excuse me gentlemen.
The ring is over here.

109
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,458
Glorious!

110
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,083
Only the best for you.

111
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,916
It's custom made Mahogany.

112
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,291
Ready! Go!

113
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,208
What was that sound?

114
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
It's just a sprain, right?!

115
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,958
Tell me it's just sprain.

116
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,125
Nope. Pretty sure it's broken.

117
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,166
Oh! My precious arm!

118
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,541
What am I gonna do?!

119
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,333
I have a test coming up
and this is my writing hand.

120
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,083
I told you not
to do this, idiots.

121
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,958
Well, why should I care?
I'm just here to see Tenma.

122
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,708
She's studying math. Cake math.

123
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,583
Man, I hate fractions!
They're too hard!

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,416
Oh! She's trying to divide
it into three pieces.

125
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,791
All right! Now's my chance
to show her what I'm made of!

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,041
Now!

127
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,458
There!

128
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,166
Now the remaining three
pieces are all exact thirds!

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,708
How'd I do, Tenma?

130
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,041
Harima! You're so smart!

131
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,041
That was brilliant!

132
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,125
Nice going Whiskers!

133
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,333
I should give you more credit!

134
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,375
Um. Those are fourths.

135
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,250
Looks like you guys are
just about finished, to me.

136
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,916
Hey. I'm talkin' to you.

137
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,125
This game's not over yet.

138
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,208
Harima...

139
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,041
No prob. Take all
the time ya need.

140
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,583
You guys've got some
fine lookin' dames

141
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,125
after all and we could
use a couple of 'em.

142
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,166
Harima! We can't
afford to lose anymore!

143
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,458
Yeah. I know.

144
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,791
Damn. How did we
end up like this?

145
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,541
So, Karasuma's absent?

146
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,500
He's missed every day
this week so far.

147
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,916
Whoa... I wonder why?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,916
Maybe you should go over
to his house and check on him.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,500
Well, you know...

150
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,041
Right now I've got this other
thing going on, so I'll wait.

151
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,416
Wait!

152
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,416
Things aren't going well
between Tenma and Karasuma?

153
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,125
Finally, the chance
I've needed all along!

154
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,833
Your heart belongs
to me now, baby!

155
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,208
Hey! Tenma!

156
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,083
Oh! By the way, have you
tried Tougou's box lunches?

157
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,250
They're amazing!

158
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,500
They're this big!
And the food's awesome!

159
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,166
Who would've thought--

160
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,250
What the hell?!

161
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,250
She's having lunch
with that bastard!

162
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,875
Have you guys ever
had that stuff before?

163
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,291
No, what is it?

164
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,083
Pasta. It has a sauce called
Arabian Nights on it,

165
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
and it's super delicious!

166
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,916
You mean Arrabiata.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,208
Have you ever had it, Harima?

168
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,958
Uh... No.

169
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,750
So, anyway,...

170
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,125
have you had it Eri?

171
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,833
You're kidding me!!
Arrabi-what?!

172
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,708
I'll take soba noodles
over that any day!

173
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,875
Stupid freak!
This guy is pissin' me off!

174
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,083
I'm going to Tougou's place

175
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,000
to learn more about
these again today.

176
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,833
Yeah? You've been
going there every day, huh?

177
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,541
Hey. What is this?

178
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,166
This is terrible!

179
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,583
I know!

180
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,541
Our class is facing a
crisis of ridiculous proportions

181
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,125
and we're the only
ones who can stop it!

182
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,708
There's no time to lose!

183
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,041
We have to save class 2-C from
a devil named Tougou! Now!!!!

184
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,750
All right, four eyes,
you're making perfect sense

185
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,791
for once in your life!
It's go time!

186
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,250
Miss Tsukamoto! Listen!

187
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,041
About this Tougou that you've
been hanging out with lately!

188
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,375
He's dangerous! You shouldn't
go near him again...! Ever!

189
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,250
Damn it! No response!

190
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,333
She's already been brainwashed!

191
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,333
No! Don't give up just yet.

192
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,625
I know how to handle this.

193
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,750
I'll bring her back!

194
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:44,000
Please! Tenma, listen
to me, open your eyes!!

195
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,375
What do you want, Harima?

196
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,583
Who the hell are you?

197
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,333
Can't you see I am Lara?

198
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,291
I mean!I'm Tenma!

199
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
You're not Tenma,
what're you up to?

200
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Oh, Harima!
Why are you so mean?!

201
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,458
Wow! Ichijou just
won a gold medal!

202
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,083
No! Where?!

203
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,875
Ha! We can see right
through you, Lara!

204
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,791
What's wrong with you?

205
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,833
I'm Tenma! You've gone crazy!

206
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,833
You're the one who's crazy!

207
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,375
Just shut up already!

208
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,541
Damn!! This means
Tenma's already in 2-D.

209
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,166
Okay. Lara Gonzalez.

210
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,041
Why don't you please
translate the next one?

211
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,416
Hoo-wah!

212
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,708
Uh... Tenma.
What're you doing here...?

213
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,541
I'm Lara and you
need new glasses!

214
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,583
Please go back to
your classroom, Tenma.

215
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,875
And send Lara back here.

216
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,833
Just a minute, please.

217
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,541
Mr. Tani.

218
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,583
Why did you decide to become
a teacher in the first place?

219
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,916
Was it for the Money?
Or the Fame?

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,625
That wasn't why, was it?

221
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,958
No!

222
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,583
It's because you wanted
to give a fighting chance

223
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,375
to kids who want to learn!

224
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
Isn't that what matters?!

225
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,666
Who cares about classes,
and school,

226
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,458
and the rules of society?!

227
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,166
The kids are what count!

228
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,541
Right, Mr. Tani?

229
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,416
Yes.

230
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,375
You're right on target, Tougou.

231
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,041
Students of 2-D,
can I get a witness?!

232
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,750
Yes! Hallelujah!

233
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,541
All right!
This class is the best!

234
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,166
We demand that you give
back Tenma Tsukamoto!

235
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,666
She belongs to us!

236
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,208
Isn't that cute...

237
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,291
It looks like the
short bus has arrived.

238
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,750
Yeah I see that...

239
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,875
you sad 'cause
no one'll play with ya?

240
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,750
How 'bout we play
"Rich Man, Poor Man" for her.

241
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,000
All right then!

242
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,541
If that's the way you
want to play it, fine!

243
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,416
But don't come crying
to us when you lose her!

244
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,041
What's it gonna be?

245
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,125
Crap. I don't have
a chance in hell

246
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,958
if I keep gettin'
cards like this.

247
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,791
Looks like Hanai's
not doing so good either.

248
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,250
What the hell is so funny?

249
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,333
I'm out!

250
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,916
You were supposed
to put down that 2!

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,208
Sorry!

252
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,583
Pathetic!

253
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,750
It won't do you any good
to fight amongst yourselves.

254
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,166
So... It's time
to make a choice...

255
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,083
We won, and we're not
leaving here empty-handed.

256
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,958
What d'you want.

257
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,958
You can have the blond.

258
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,416
That okay with you?

259
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Harima!!

260
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,291
What're you doing?!

261
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,458
We're fine with that.

262
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,000
Now get outta here.

263
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,250
No! We're not leaving
until we get those two back!

264
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,875
We'll wager Suou and
Takano against Eri!

265
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,958
Pretty gutsy, four-eyes.

266
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,000
Whew.

267
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,750
Things are just
getting interesting.

268
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,166
All right, let's do this.

269
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,791
Well, I'm out.

270
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,041
Damn!

271
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,500
Wait a second.
It's not over yet.

272
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,875
It's all you.

273
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,250
As long as I get you back,
Tenma, I'll be happy.

274
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,333
I could care less
about the rest of 'em.

275
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,625
I'll raise you.

276
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,083
Then I'll raise you two more.

277
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,458
An' I'll raise you again.

278
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,416
Harima, you sure...?

279
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,041
His cards are glowing!

280
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,458
Just then, the
strangest thing happened.

281
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,000
Harima's cards suddenly lit up

282
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,833
with a bluish white flash,
and everyone saw it.

283
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,625
I'm afraid your luck
has finally run out.

284
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,416
Game over!

285
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,041
Did Miss Tsukamoto
come back yet?

286
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,250
The class has been
taken over by 2-D!

287
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,458
Today we'll be learning
the fundamentals.

288
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,250
Pottery is the soul
of Japanese Culture.

289
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,000
Always remember that!

290
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,583
Yes sir!

291
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,708
No! No!

292
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,916
No!!

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,916
I screwed up again!

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,583
I really wanted to make a
matching pair of curry dishes

295
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,291
for Karasuma,
but I just can't do this!

296
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,458
I must be missing something!

297
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,583
Are you still having
trouble? Tenma?

298
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,750
Here, let me help you.

299
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,916
Why, thank you. Karasuma.

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Tell me what to do.
What should I make for you?

301
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,291
Something to prove your love.

302
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,875
Is that what you want?

303
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,791
I got it. I'll try my best.

304
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,791
But, do you really
think you need that?

305
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,750
I see your point!

306
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,708
Yes, of course
I'll make it for you then!

307
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,291
Oh, this is all so sudden!

308
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,291
But if that's what
my Karasuma wants,

309
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,041
then that's
what he'll get!

310
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,791
Tenma. We really
need to go home now.

311
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,833
Please, eat your
dinner my darling.

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,708
There you are.

313
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,125
Yes, Akira. What would
you like me to do?

314
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,125
I'm thirsty.
Go buy me a can of juice.

315
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,625
Yes, Ma'am!
Your wish is my command!

316
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,666
Whiskers. I want some tea.

317
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,291
Now, hurry up will you?

318
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,541
Sorry. 100 yen won't be enough.

319
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,125
I'm gonna need about another 20.

320
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,791
Just do it.

321
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,041
Yes.

322
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,166
Pathetic.

323
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,416
First you're too slow,

324
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,291
and then you don't even
get me what I asked for.

325
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,541
Go buy me a juice!

326
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,000
What?! You just said
you wanted some tea!!

327
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,166
Well, you took too long,
so I changed my mind.

328
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,166
You think I'm just
gonna stand here

329
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,041
and let you take
advantage of me?!

330
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,166
You two had the nerve to gamble

331
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,958
with our lives
without our permission.

332
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
And you're going to complain?

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,791
We're sorry, Ma'am!

334
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,333
Damn! They're
gonna kill us... No.

335
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,333
They'll keep us alive
'cause it hurts more.

336
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,750
There doesn't seem to be any way

337
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,000
they're going to
accept an apology.

338
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,541
We'll have to do
something drastic.

339
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,541
Wow!! Awesome! I've
always wanted to come here!

340
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,666
It's our pleasure.

341
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,875
We wanted to take you out

342
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,000
for dinner as a
token of our gratitude.

343
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,000
Dammit! I can't afford all this!

344
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,208
It's a chance to redeem
ourselves, all right?!

345
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,583
So, help me out here!

346
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,916
What should we eat?!

347
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,916
Why don't we start with
the white chocolate Curry?

348
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,000
It's delish!

349
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,500
Yeah! The sweetness
of the chocolate

350
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,958
really compliments
the spiciness of the curry!

351
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,208
This Japanese curry is good too!

352
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,708
It's like a party in my mouth.

353
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,375
Announcing a special event!

354
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,791
The super spicy Magma Curry
speed-eating contest!

355
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,208
All you brave souls,
sign up now!

356
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,541
Wow, how cool!

357
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,833
This says if you win the contest

358
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,291
you'll get to eat here
free for a whole year!

359
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,583
Aw, snap! I'll win this
for ya, just sit tight!

360
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,958
What? You're gonna enter?!

361
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,250
A chance to restore my honor...!

362
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,916
Mikoto, I'll need your help!

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,958
For real?!

364
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,041
Since when do
you eat spicy foods?

365
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,041
Well, I guess we
have to enter too then.

366
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,708
Akira, you can't be serious!

367
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,416
The heaping super spicy
Magma Curry plates

368
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,041
have all been distributed.

369
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,041
Get ready! And Eat!

370
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,666
Damn! This is too hot!!!

371
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,958
I think I'm gonna die!!!

372
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,625
Uh-oh! Several contestants
have already dropped out!

373
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,875
Wild card contestants Harima
and Hanai are in a dead heat!

374
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,625
I'm spent.

375
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,750
Come on Hanai!

376
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,166
Cut some of the spiciness
with these pickles,

377
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,375
or you're gonna regret it later!

378
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,083
Harima, please don't
push yourself too hard!

379
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,833
You're really sweating!

380
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,250
Tenma... If I don't
make it through this,

381
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,791
you have my permission to laugh
at me for being such a dumbass.

382
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,708
Hot damn!

383
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,333
It looks like Harima is
really picking up his pace

384
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,583
and Hanai is not too far behind!

385
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,333
Akira, just look at them!

386
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,041
I'm lookin'.

387
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,333
No, I can't... give up yet.
Gotta keep going.

388
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,833
Look at that guy!

389
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,875
He's just eating
spoonfuls of air!

390
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,750
His glasses are so
fogged up he can't see!

391
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,500
I don't even think
he's conscious.

392
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,041
That kid's gotta lotta heart.

393
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, Poor Hanai!

394
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,875
He is... down!

395
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,208
This is all for you, Tenma!

396
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,208
Dear god, why?!

397
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,291
Oh man!

398
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,625
This is bad!

399
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,791
Only the red-hot magma
curry roux sauce is left!

400
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,708
Is this the end for Harima?

401
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,333
This is the only way.

402
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,041
What?!

403
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,125
Don't tell me he's...

404
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,708
That's enough, Harima!

405
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,333
Please, you don't
have to do this.

406
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,708
Oh, Tenma.

407
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,875
You know as well as
I do that I have to do this.

408
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,625
Men are always pushing
themselves beyond their limits.

409
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,958
That's just the way we are.

410
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,125
Now watch a man
do what he does best!

411
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,333
Whoa!

412
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:37,875
Crazy!

413
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,000
All in one gulp!

414
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,666
That's what we
call a Magma Dive!

415
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,875
Now, I just have
to swallow this!

416
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,708
Oh! Looks like we've got
ourselves a winner over here!

417
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,875
Wow! That was so good!

418
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,791
You did it Satsuki!

419
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,625
That's your fifth win!

420
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,916
Miss Tawaraya successfully
defends her title!

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,541
Is that... Oh my gosh, it is!

422
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,833
What are you guys doing here?

423
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,125
Yeah... Do you
like to eat magma?

424
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,416
Are you okay, Harima?
Did you eat too much?

425
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Oh. No! The truth is
I could've eaten a lot more...

426
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,166
But I decided to let
Satsuki win at the end.

427
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,125
You're amazing!

428
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,833
S'okay! You'll win
next time, right?

429
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,833
Sure... But let's try it
with a different kind of food...

430
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,458
You know, for variety.

431
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,541
Lara! Lara! Lara!

432
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,375
This... is a very special story

433
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,416
about a transfer
student who became...

434
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,958
a legend in her own time.

435
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,833
Ay no! I cut too much!

436
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,041
What do I do! What do I do!

437
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,291
Ichijou! Ichijou!

438
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,375
I tried to cut my own hair,
but I screwed up. Ayudame.

439
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,958
No way! You tried
to cut it by yourself?

440
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,166
If you're looking
for a beauty parlor,

441
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,208
I recommend the
"Now Bird" Hair Salon!

442
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,625
But,... isn't that
place kinda weird?

443
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,000
It's okay. They
really know their stuff.

444
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,416
They'll treat you well.

445
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,541
Oh! This feels so good!

446
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,958
Ohh yeah, that's she said.

447
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,291
What the hell are
you doing here?!

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,208
What are you talking about?

449
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,708
It's my family's shop!

450
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,875
Didn't they tell you
that before you came in?!

451
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,791
We're leaving now, Ichijou!

452
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,666
That was horrible!

453
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,583
What are you going to do Lara?

454
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,708
You can't just keep that
scarf over your head forever.

455
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,083
It's Harry! Hide!!

456
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,583
There are too many
people we know here.

457
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,416
Where do you get
your hair cut, Ichijou?

458
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,750
I guess, Shibuya?

459
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,541
What's with all these people?

460
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,250
Is there a festival today?

461
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,833
Maybe! I'm so sorry!
I don't know!

462
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,750
I don't really ever come here!

463
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,208
Say what?!

464
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,458
Hey there, gorgeous!
Have we met before?

465
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:36,791
They attacked Bunpei!

466
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,250
What the hell?!
Let's teach 'em a lesson!

467
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,666
Those girls are dead meat!

468
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,000
What were they
thinking insulting

469
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,416
the "Shibuya" gang like that?!

470
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,458
Ichijou! Is this
part of the festival?

471
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,791
I have absolutely no idea!

472
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,416
Kill 'em!

473
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,208
And the legend began.

474
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,791
Wow! Those two are amazing!

475
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,166
They just keep beating
those guys to a pulp!

476
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,875
You girls rock!

477
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,583
They're like Wonder Woman
without the Grannie panties!

478
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,375
Lara! Lara! Lara!

479
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:28,666
And so Lara became
the queen of Shibuya.

480
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,000
Soon, the phrase "Girls
Be Lara" became a big hit.

481
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,833
And, "The Lara Look" started
appearing on billboards

482
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,541
and advertisements everywhere.

Wearing a scarf on your head
became the most popular

484
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,041
fashion trend among
all the girls in the land.

00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,583
I'll be putting
out a single, next!

486
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,000
No way!

487
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,541
Unfortunately, the single
wasn't at all successful.

488
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,208
