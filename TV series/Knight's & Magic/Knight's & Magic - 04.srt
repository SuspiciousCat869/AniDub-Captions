00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,541
[SELESTINA] After a successful
trial of the Telestale's

2
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:15,583
new armaments, Ernesti
discovered a flaw in his design.

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,041
The unit's mana drained rapidly.

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,000
Unless he could fix this,

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,000
the design would not
be suited for actual combat.

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,916
It's like we thought.
New output killed it.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,208
Fuel efficiency's nonexistent.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,083
Figures. Unfortunately,
we can't make any changes

9
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,166
to the Ether Reactor.
That would fix everything.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,333
Couldn't we just increase
the mana storage capacity?

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,666
Sure, but we'd have to
install extra Crystal Tissue

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,375
to compensate for it.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,750
But, more tissue
means more mana usage.

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,916
We'd be back where we started.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How can we break the cycle?

16
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,083
No problem! This sort of thing
is Ernie's specialty!

17
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,625
--It is?
--Yeah, silly!

18
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,375
You're the one who
kept saying the new Knights

19
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,041
don't have to look human.

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,541
So, you don't have to stick
to human muscles! Right?

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,875
Yeah! I didn't think of that!

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,791
If our goal is mana capacity,

23
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,208
then the Knight's form
doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,208
Of course,
it's kinda embarrassing

25
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,666
you came up with it.

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,625
Hey! What's that mean?

27
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,250
[bird chirping]

28
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,666
Gently. Almost.

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,416
Good! Stop there!

30
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,333
[ARCHID] Whoa. What are you
adding to our gears?

31
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,750
They look pretty intense.

32
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,291
It would be easier
to show than tell.

33
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,833
[BOTH]
Uh?

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,750
Kid. Addy. Ready when you are.

35
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:04,875
[ARCHID]
All set.

36
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,291
Let the test begin!

37
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,500
First, we'll try
the wire anchor!

38
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,291
[ADELTRUD, ARCHID laughing]

[ERNESTI grunts]

40
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,666
[ADELTRUD gasps]

41
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,000
I'd call that a
successful field test.

42
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,208
Agreed! Let's move on!

43
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,583
This is a new ranged weapon

44
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,833
made with the Strand-Type
Crystal Tissue.

45
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,833
We're calling it the Scorpius.

46
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,083
It would be faster for
you to use it than for me

47
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,875
to explain how it works,
so just give it a whirl.

48
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,666
'Kay. Like this?

49
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,458
Here goes. Ah!

50
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,583
--Yes!
--Crazy!

51
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,416
Uh. Are you sure it's okay
to fire this thing in town?

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,250
Yeah! Now, fire multiple shots!

53
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,083
Multiple?

54
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,541
[ARCHID]
Uuh...

55
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,875
[ERNESTI] It's an
automatic-fire siege weapon!

56
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,458
It works better than I thought!

57
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,375
Ernie, what's the point
of having something like this?

58
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,041
--Huh?
--[ADELTRUD] Seriously.

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,708
Why make grapplers
and siege weapons

60
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,000
unless you're going to use them?

61
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,333
[ERNESTI]
Mmm.

62
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,916
Honestly, I hadn't
thought of that.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,583
I just wanted to
challenge myself

64
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,625
and see if I could pull it off!

65
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,416
For a genius,
you're kind of an idiot.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,166
[SELESTINA] Meanwhile,
the plan to increase

67
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,958
the amount of Crystal Tissue
had run into some problems.

68
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,083
[ADELTRUD] It looks so dumb!
It's all bulky now!

69
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
It's almost too heavy to move.

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,000
Back to the drawing board.

71
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,875
Maybe some kind of
external pack would work?

72
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,833
It's totally different
than before! There's no balance!

73
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,750
This selfish machine's
gonna give me gray hairs.

74
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,333
[TEACHER 1B] The Aubigne
Mountains range so far,

75
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:01,041
they effectively split the
continent of Zetterlund in two.

76
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,000
To the west of the mountains
lies the western kingdoms,

77
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,750
the so-called Occident.

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,541
And, of course,
our fair kingdom of Fremmevilla

79
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,666
encompasses the eastern half.

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,000
We're connected to
the Great Bocuse Forest,

81
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,458
where the demon
beasts originate.

82
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,750
[ERNESTI] It's frustrating.
I'll have to consider

83
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,791
the Telestale complete, for now.

84
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,500
But, I already know
what my next step will be.

85
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,625
I wanted to speak to you
about this new unit, Ernesti.

86
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,250
When you started this project,
I expected little more than

87
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,333
an improvement to the basic
Salodreah model, but this!

88
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,958
You've made something completely
different, haven't you?

89
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,708
Yup! There's never been
a Silhouette Knight like it.

90
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,166
I see. Should I
inform his majesty

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,208
that you're ready
to present the unit?

92
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,125
No. Not yet. He asked for
the best I had to offer.

93
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,583
We still have a long way
to go before it's ready.

94
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,166
If he wasn't so impressive, this
kid'd be downright terrifying.

95
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,291
The Telestale is a foundation.

96
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,666
One that I intend to build
a marvelous castle on top of.

97
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,791
That's what it's going to take

98
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,125
if I truly want
to shock the king.

99
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,041
Very well. But keep the
"shock" to a minimum.

100
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,250
My heart can't take it.

101
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,375
Now, then.
It may not be finished,

102
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,583
but I should turn in
some form of report.

103
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,625
The king doesn't need
to be bothered with it.

104
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,541
Submit a report
to the Lab instead.

105
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,041
You mean the Silhouette
Knight Lab, right?

106
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,458
Filling them in now would help
streamline the overall process.

107
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,166
Great idea, boss!

108
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,041
[LAURI]
Hmm.

109
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,541
[SELESTINA] Lauri was concerned
about the effect the new unit

110
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,208
would have on the laboratory.

111

Developing Silhouette
Knights had always

112
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,375
been a major government project.

113
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,166
How would they respond
when they learned

114
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
a single Knight Runner
student had done it?

115
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,625
Their reaction
may not be favorable.

116
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,000
Only time would tell.

Oh. Right, we said we'd tell him
whenever Ernie made progress.

122
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,541
We might as well.

123
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,875
If we don't, he'll find out
from the laboratory.

124
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,833
It's better if we
get to tell him ourselves.

125
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,791
Good point!
We can't have any of them

This feels off.

The Marquis has taken

140

an interest in your project and
wishes to see it for himself.

00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,458
These demon beasts
like to lurk underground.

159
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,500
They can be very
difficult to deal with,

160
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,583
but if you keep calm
and listen close,

161
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,750
you can predict
where they'll go.

162
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,291
Glad you could join us!

[GUY 4A grunts]

173
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:57,000
Good. I'm glad they survived.

174
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,083
If the new unit's
so weak that a shaker worm

175
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,833
can take it down, then we've
wasted our time here.

176
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,333
It works. And if it's
as powerful as it seems,

177
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,041
we can't let those
Scarlet Bunnies keep it.

178
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,041
I agree, but still, it's said
that even a single ant

179
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,625
couldn't find a way
into Fort Casadesus.

180

Once they're safely
within the walls,

181
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,083
even our Order of
the Bronze Fang

182
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,583
won't be able to get to them.

[KERHILD] Idiot.
Leave it to a man to think

00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,708
force is the only
viable solution.

185
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,333
If you use your brain
for once, you'd see.

186
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,666
We already have the answer.

[ADELTRUD sighs]

00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,833
I could really use
a dose of Ernie in my life.

I haven't seen or hugged him

--Eh?
--You know!

Why is that Marquis
coming to see the new unit

instead of his majesty?

How am I supposed
to know? Jeez.

This whole thing
was your idea, Archid!

Where's Ernie?

He and the Telestale

212
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,250
will be staying at
the Fort for the time being.

213
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,833
[BOTH]
Uuuuh!

214
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,750
[KNUT] You saw
the new design in action.

215
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,958
What was your impression of it?

216
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,833
[MORTEN] In terms of speed,
output, and firepower,

217
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,375
I'd say it's vastly superior
to the Kaldatoahs.

218
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,791
I have no choice but
to give it high marks.

219
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,416
[sighs] "It's the single
greatest thing ever," huh? Eh.

--[MORTEN] Sir?
--Never mind.

221
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,583
It seems these new units
will be a great benefit to us.

222
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,333
We will treat them the same way
as their predecessors.

223
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,791
Sir.

224
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
[KNUT]
The Silhouette Knights represent

225
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,166
our kingdom's
greatest accomplishment.

226
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,625
It took nearly 300 years

227
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,916
for the original
Salodreah to be replaced,

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,166
and the current Kaldatoah's have
been in service for generations.

229
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,500
Compared to that, this
arrogant child's "hobby"

230
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,416
makes creating a Silhouette
Knight look like child's play.

231
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,791
[MORTEN] His majesty would be
excited over the boy's success.

232
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,250
--That's a problem.
--[MORTEN] Hm?

233
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,833
That boy. He's up to something,
and I will find out what it is,

234
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,291
no matter what.

Stephania? Why are you here?

the room for a moment?

I need to discuss with you.

get here from Laihiala?

Very well.

243
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,333
[JOACHIM]
All right. What's this about?

244
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,166
You owe me an explanation.

245
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,625
Not until I get
a straight answer.

246
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,250
Father, what'd you
tell the Marquis?

247
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:19,083
[KNUT] Ernesti Echevalier.
You've been busy as of late.

248
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,833
It's a pleasure
to see you again, sir.

249
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,750
What can I do for you?

250
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,125
[KNUT]
You can go over the new unit.

251
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
And you won't
leave anything out.

252

[chalk tapping]

254
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,041
[ERNESTI]
Okay. So, as you can see,

255
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
by replacing the old
Crystal Tissue with the refined

256
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,125
Strand-Type Crystal Tissue

257
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,541
and re-fitting
the Telestale with it,

258
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:54,208
we achieved nearly two times
the output of existing units.

259
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,916
Please refer to the paper
I gave you for the next part.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,708
As I said before, the biggest
flaw in the Telestale's design

261
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,166
is it's running time,
apart from that.

262
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,958
I can refine it a bit more.

263
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,583
Especially in terms
of production cost.

264
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,125
We can expect
improvement in regard

265
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,916
to those two points
in the future.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,125
--Now!
--[gasps]

267
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,958
[ERNESTI]
The most important part of all.

268
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,125
The Ether Reactor must still
use existing technology.

269
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,875
That's the biggest roadblock.

270
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,625
It makes it hard to
improve anything further.

271
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,833
I hope you can understand
my dilemma here.

272
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,041
Anyway, that's all there is
to tell about the new unit

273
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,833
and its future
development plans.

274
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,666
I hope it met your expectations.

275
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
Yes.

276
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,958
Do you have any
further questions, sir?

277
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,875
Of course. Plenty.

278
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,208
[ERNESTI]
Go ahead.

279
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,875
As you know, I've been given
full authority here.

280
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,125
That means over you
and the unit's development.

281
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,500
In other words, the project
is no longer yours.

282
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,458
Any evaluations
and decisions are mine

283
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,625
to make from here on out.

284
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,083
The explanation you just
gave me will be the one

285
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,875
I give to his majesty, verbatim.

286
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,541
Do you have
any problem with that?

287
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,916
--Not at all!
--Excuse me?

288
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,583
[ERNESTI] That means I won't
have to give his majesty

289
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,000
the same explanation
myself, right?

290
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,083
I'll leave it
in your capable hands.

[gasps]

292
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,875
Of course,
if you have new questions,

293

I'll happily answer them!
[giggles]

y-you're okay with that?

Okay with what?
I'm confused, sir.

296

Honor! Wealth! Status!
Your future! All of it!

297
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,166
[ERNESTI]
I don't understand.

298
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,625
What're you playing at?

299
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,125
Just what do you intend
to do after this?

300
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,208
[ERNESTI] Well, I'm still
only a first-year student

301
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,625
at the Knight Runner
middle school, sir.

302
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,000
I suppose I'll focus
on graduating--

303
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,958
[KNUT] Stop lying to me,
you irreverent brat!

304
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,416
This is a serious matter!

305
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,291
Don't you understand
what you've done?

306
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,750
I, uh, developed
a new Silhouette Knight?

307
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,291
Don't make it sound so simple!

308
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,833
Feels silly to explain this,
but I'll do it anyway.

309
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,083
Listen! Ever since the
founding of our kingdom--

310
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,125
no, since the dawn
of written history itself.

311
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,750
No Silhouette Knight has ever

Such a feat was deemed
to be impossible! Look!

00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,708
The development of a Silhouette
Knight is a major endeavor!

314

For over half a millennium
they were only achieved

through time and the hard work
of countless personnel.

But you. You go and
make it look easy!

Then you have
the unmitigated gall

to be a normal child?

Well, if it helps, the Telestale
isn't the final unit

Of course not!
I was challenged!

325
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,375
The king wanted to see
the best machine I can make,

326

What do you think of that, Knut?

The Crystal Tissue could
only support a maximum

we've taken it up to eleven!

was only supposed to explain

he should have been back sooner.

You see? I was right!
I'm gonna go talk to him!

out of there by force!
