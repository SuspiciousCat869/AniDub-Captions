1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:12,833
[clanging]

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,416
[DAVID]
Well, D?

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,458
How do you like the new
and improved Guair?

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,666
[DIETRICH]
It's a massive disappointment!

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,458
[DAVID]
Aww, come on!

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,875
The output and
the response speed

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,875
are the same as the Telestale.

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,750
And yet, you've managed to keep

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,375
the original Guair's
maneuverability intact.

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,333
On top of that,
it has the greatest firepower

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,958
of anything
at the academy, but...

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,458
I don't get to keep it.

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,375
So, yeah, I'm more than
a little ticked off right now.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,541
It's too good for
that shriveled Marquis.

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,541
S'fine with me. I did my job,
and it's damn good.

16
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,583
Losing Guair is a shame,

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,958
but at least we're getting
Kaldatoahs out of it.

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,375
The Marquis is sending
an entire companies worth.

19
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,958
The academy's had to rely
on older model Salodreahs

20
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,666
for so long.
I think it's a good trade.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,083
[BATSON]
Hey, David!

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,333
We're all packed up
and ready to go!

23
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,458
Good work! Let's move!

24
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,666
I'm getting too
old for this. Mm?

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,833
What are these?

26
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,166
[ARCHID]
The new Silhouette Gears.

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,458
I guess Ernie found time
to work on them, too.

28
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,916
And all new units
go to the Marquis.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,916
[DAVID] Eh. Makes sense,
but do you have to take

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
silver hair's unit with us, too?

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,833
Of course we do!
He can't play with us

32
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,833
unless he has his own, silly!

33
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,208
[DAVID grunts]

34
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,291
Ow! What did I do?

35
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,875
We're movin' out! Open up!

36
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:39,250
Edgar! D! Say hi
to Ernie for me!

37
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,083
[SELESTINA] And so,
the students of Laihiala Academy

38
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,625
set off for Fort Casadesus.

39
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:49,833
Unaware that this trip would
change their lives forever.

40
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,041
[SELESTINA] The company
of Scarlet Rabbit knights

41
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,708
that arrived in Darie Village

42
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,375
culled the marauding
demon beasts.

43
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,625
As they began repair
and relief efforts,

44
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,958
a lone messenger was
sent back to the fortress.

45
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,250
Huh. Apparently only fighting
demon beasts have made

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,208
these country bumpkins
easy prey for us.

47
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,458
No need to worry.
The Order of the Bronze Fang

48
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,791
won't let your death be in vain.

49
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,541
Stay sharp! We're going in!

50
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,000

52

[SOLDIER 5A]
Huh?

53
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,916
I was wondering
where you were!

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,250
It must have been bad
out there! How's Darie village?

55
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,125
Huh?

56
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:48,166
[ENGINEER 5A] Welcome back!
Take her into repair dais three!

57
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
Huh?

58
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,416
[ENGINEER 5A yells]

00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,333
No time for lagging!

00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,791
They'll know we're
here soon enough!

62
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,875
Found 'em, boss! Take your pick.

63
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,250
[KERHILT] Hm. I think
I'll take the lot of them.

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,541
We have to move quickly!
Let's get going boys!

65
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,625
The other Silhouette Knights
will get in our way.

66
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,500
Leave nothing but scrap!

67
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,875
What is this?
An accident or an attack?

68
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,791
[SOLDIER 5C gasps]
Someone's taking the new units!

69
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,250
[SOLDIER 5B] Get the other
Silhouette Knights!

70
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,708
Don't let them leave the Fort!

00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,166
[ALL gasp]

72
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,333
[KERHILT grunts]
It's like a rampaging stallion!

73
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,250
What gives? I thought
this country's machines

74
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,250
were supposed to be easy to use!

75
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,125
Guess I shouldn't
expect too much

76
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,166
from something a kid made.

77
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,375
You better be worth the trouble!

78
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,708
Ha. 'Least the rat was
right about something.

Ugh. These bumpkins
are quicker than I thought.

00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,416
It's confirmed, my lord.

81
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,458
They stole a Kaldatoah
and several Telestales.

00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,041
Sorry I took so long.

I'm ready to help
however you need.

Just let me know and I'll--

Silence!

87
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,708
You are more than a simple
Knight Runner student.

88
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,708
You're the core of
Silhouette Knight development,

89
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,750
and would do well
to remember it.

90
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,833
Don't do anything foolish!

[KNUT]
Deploy the Haimerwort!

93
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,291
Knight Commander Morten Fredholm
will take to the field

94
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,000
and make the attackers
regret this folly!

95
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,125
[GUY 4A chuckles] These rods
on the back work great!

96
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,791
I could do this all night!

97
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,791
Don't get cocky, or you'll
run your mana stores dry!

98
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,166
Time to leave this party!

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,833
[SOLDIER 5F] Don't let them
out of the Fort! Stop them here!

[MORTEN]
Stand aside.

103
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:14,166
What? Did you really think
we'd let you go that easily?

104
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,125

Stay back, this one's mine.

Damn you!

I won't let you get away!

Try and stop me!

You're pretty hot-blooded.
I admire that.

Surrender, you fool!

Damn, they're fast.

113
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,875
[MORTEN] How are these new units
stronger than Haimerwort?

114
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,875
I wasn't expecting that.

115
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,708
I assumed I'd never
fight them in real battle.

116
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,875
I should've been more cautious.

117
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
Go, Lady Kerhilt!
I'll cover you!

118
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
[KERHILT]
I'll leave it to you, Bacchus.

119
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
Anyone who can move, follow me!

120
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
[grunts] I'd hoped to
take more presents back home,

121
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,500
but we'll have to
make due with these two.

122
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,958
Hm?

123
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,250
Dammit! How'd they get
support here so fast?

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
Why are Telestales out here?

125
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,458
Keep your guard up, D.
Something seems off.

126
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,916
[SELESTINA] As Kerhilt's gang
made their escape

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
from the fortress,
they unexpectedly

128
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,666
encountered the convoy
from Laihiala.

129
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Brought together
by a twist of fate,

130
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,000
the two groups would soon clash.

[EDGAR] You there! We are Knight
Runners from Laihiala Academy.

We are delivering these
new units for inspection

133

at the request of the Marquis.

00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,416
Aah!

135
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,791
They didn't even introduce
themselves; how rude.

136
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,250
What is the meaning of this?
Explain yourself!

I was never one
for small talk, kid.

shouldn't pose a problem.

No clue, I'm afraid.

315
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,500
They came out of nowhere
and hid the Telestale's path.

316
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,458
I see. In other words,
I can blame <i>them</i>

317
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,375
for losing it and make them pay?

318
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,666
[DIETRICH]
Uh. Uh. I-- Sure.

319
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,166
[MORTEN]
Impressive.

320
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,750
For students, you have an
incredible amount of courage.

321
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,791
It would be my honor to
fight these cretins with you.

322
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,833
All right, let's go!

323
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,958
[SELESTINA]
Ernesti and his friends fought

324
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,083
the demon beast horde
with everything they had.

325
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,958
When dawn finally broke
over the horizon,

326
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,958
only the Knight Runners
were left standing.

327
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
[KNUT]
Demon beasts are one thing,

328
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,750
but an assault
by human attackers.

329
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,958
I can't remember a time when
that's happened in Fremmevilla.

330
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,583
I'm afraid that's not
the worst of it.

331
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,958
Huh?

332
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,750
Our scouts reported back.

333
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,166
They found traces of
cursed bait in the forest.

334
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,208
Uh! Cursed bait?

335
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,625
At the very least that
explains why the demon beasts

336
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,750
had been worked
into such a frenzy.

337
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,666
But who in Fremmevilla
would use such a thing?

338
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,458
No. It's entirely possible
they weren't from our country.

339
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,041
[MORTEN] Then,
the stolen Silhouette Knight

340
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,958
could be anywhere.

341
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,125
[sighs]

342
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,333
[SELESTINA] Several days
passed after what history

343
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,375
would eventually call the
"Casadesus Incident."

344
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,166
By the order of
King Ambrosius himself,

345
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,083
the students involved in the
development of the Telestale

346
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,500
were summoned to Schreiber
Castle for an audience.

347
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,375
Your work on the new
Silhouette Knight

348
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,500
surpassed all my expectations.

349
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,083
But now that one
has been stolen,

350
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,333
we must work diligently
to move beyond your success

351
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,083
and to better maintain the
secrecy of your new developments

352
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,250
for the foreseeable future.

353
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,791
Therefore, I declare
the creation of a new order.

354
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,291
A group of knights who will
assist in this great mission.

355
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,375
Ernesti Echevalier.

356
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,833
I can think of no one better
to command this order than you.

357
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,666
[ALL gasp]

358
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,291
Thank you. I am honored.

359
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,333
It won't be much of an order
without a name, though.

360
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,875
Hmm.

361
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:57,125
"Silver" in honor of you.
And from myself,

362
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,625
I think "Phoenix" is fitting.

363
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,625
The Order of the Silver Phoniex.

364
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,500
I know you will do
Fremmevilla proud.

365
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,916
[ADELTRUD giggles]

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,375
[EDGAR] Silver Phoenix?
It's a good name.

367
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,750
Yeah. I guess it's all right.

368
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,083
Helvi, there's something
I haven't told you

369
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,666
about the incident yet.

370
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,333
Hm? What's up?

371
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,916
The stolen Telestale.
The one I fought at the end.

372
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,083
Was the one
made from Trandorkis.

373
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,666
Sorry. I should have told you.

374
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,458
It's fine. When I saw
the other units,

375
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,458
I knew they had taken mine.

376
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,500
I see.

377
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,666
Helvi. I promise.

378
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,625
I'll get your partner back.
Even if it kills me.

379
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,875
They'll regret ever
laying eyes on your Telestale.

380
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,833
[HELVI]
I'll be waiting.

381
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,625
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "Trial &amp; Error"!

382
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,833
The whirlwind is calling me!
