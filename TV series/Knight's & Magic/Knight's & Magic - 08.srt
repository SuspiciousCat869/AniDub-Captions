when a messenger
arrived with dire news.

00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,625
It just came in
from Alchusaile Gap.

Marked top-secret class one.

at Alfheim."

00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,125
To Alfheim?

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,000
Have they formed
a defensive line?

The Aruvans are in position

10

[SELESTINA] Shellcased.
A type of demon beast

12
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,250
whose body is covered
in a powerful shell.

13
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,666
Similar to a bee or ant hive,
each colony is led

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,666
by a queen who also
keeps the population growing.

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,500
In rare cases, another queen
will be born into the horde.

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,625
When that happens,
the horde splits

17
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,875
and seeks out new territory.

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,750
This time, unfortunately,
one of the newly formed hordes

19
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,250
was heading straight
for Fremmevilla's

We're done. Same for

It will be impossible

know the process. And only
the Guardian Ambassador

158
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,541
may grant permission for entry
into their sacred village.

Who's that?

160

Alfheim Village owes you
a great debt. So, do not worry.

161
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,291
It would be quite rude of us not
to welcome you with open arms.

162
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,416
In accordance with our laws,
I will take you there.

By the way, Ernesti,
I have a question.

165
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,166
I was wondering
how old you think I am.

166
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,500
I would guess mid
to late twenties.

167
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:44,541
Not even close. As a matter
of fact, I'll be 87 this year.

[gasps]

169

My people descend
from the Secret Ones,

170

We Alvs prefer quiet places.
Much like Alfheim.

172
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,083
There are some like myself,
who become ambassadors

to the Changing Ones
in the outside world.

174

But we're considered strange
by other race's standards.

175
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,916
Still, they seem
content enough to let us

make Ether Reactors
for their military.

As for the secret,
I don't know it.

I'll take you to one who does,

179
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,583
but I wouldn't get
my hopes up. Because--

I don't care! I'll hear it all.
Research it all.

Take it all apart.
Reassemble it.

182
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,833
And if it doesn't work,
I'll try again!

183
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,625
If it still doesn't work, that's
when I'll decide to give up.

184

The passion for

Yes, I can see that now.
He wouldn't even let me finish.

189
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,000
I was about to tell you
that only Alvs

can construct Ether reactors.

But I doubt that
would detour you.

192
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,750
Why do so many Alvs
live in secret villages

193
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,916
instead of going out
in the world?

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,625
We can get quite lazy.
It's a result of our longevity.

195
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,333
See, for my people,
it's common to reach 500.

Huh.

Alvs are no different

But after two or even
three hundred years of life,

our drive and interest
in the world diminishes.

[ALF 8A] So, what would
you like to hear first?

00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,791
All of it! Down to
the smallest detail!

241
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,750
Don't leave anything out!

242
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,625
[ALF 8A] Very well. An Ether
Reactor is, at its core,

243
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,375
the heart of a living thing.

244
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,375
It absorbs the ether
in the air around it

245
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,083
and converts it into mana.

246
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,750
What makes
this exchange possible

247
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,208
is the catalyst crystal.

248
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,125
Without it, the reactor
may as well be rock.

249
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,541
Hold on a second.
I thought they changed mana

250
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
to magic power.

251
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,708
Yes, that's true.
But under special conditions,

252
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,166
they can also
turn ether into mana.

253
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,583
However, two things
are needed for that.

254
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,541
The first is a special script,
and the other is "blood."

255
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,791
Real blood?

256
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,458
Not any more, thankfully.

257
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,708
Though it's said that
the original Ether Reactors

258
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,208
were giant, silver vessels
carved with vast emblem graphs

259
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,166
and filled with the blood
of living things.

260
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,791
They were impressive, yes,
but had no practical use.

261
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,833
Then an ancient sage
made a breakthrough.

262
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,166
He used what we now call
alchemy to create this elixir.

263
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,291
A small amount
is all that's needed.

264
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,333
Think of it as artificial blood.

265
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,166
Next is the magical script.

266
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,416
We use an incantation

267
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,958
to carve the pulse of life
into the reactor.

268
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,833
Almost like a poem.

269
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:28,000
It's for that reason
we call it the "Life Song."

270
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,041
But the Life Song's enormous
size couldn't be altered.

271
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,500
The silver vessel
required to hold it

272
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,916
was larger than the Silhoutte
Knight it was supposed to run.

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,166
Then another
breakthrough was made.

274
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,666
We replaced the vessel with
a high-density metal, mythril.

275
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,041
It's so incredibly durable
even the dwarves'

276
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,208
master smiths couldn't mold it.

277
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:54,083
But in the hands
of us Alvs... Well, look.

278
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,833
[gasps]

279
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,208
[ERNESTI]
It's completely solid.

280
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,333
Indeed. We learned
that mythril responds

281
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,500
to a certain type of magic.

282
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,333
It transforms into something
soft and pliable, like clay.

283
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Do you mean...?

284
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,041
There are catalyst
crystals inside us.

285
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,333
Like the demon beasts,
we Alvs can use magic at will

286
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,291
from the moment we are born.

287
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,000
This ability is the reason
only the Alvs are capable

288
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,333
of constructing
an Ether Reactor.

289
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:32,375
Thus, we used our gift to refine
and mold mythril as we saw fit.

290
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,500
If you tried, it would
prove to be impossible.

291
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,250
Changing Ones lack the power
to weave the Life Song

292
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,583
and use magic
at the same moment.

293
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,166
About the Ether Reactor.

294
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,083
How is the power
output determined?

295
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,833
[ALF 8A] The size
of the catalyst crystal

296
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,708
and the efficiency of
the etheric transformation.

297
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,083
Catalysts are taken from
demon beasts and vary in size,

298
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,666
depending on the host.

299
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,000
The bigger and more
powerful the demon beast,

300
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,750
the bigger and
more efficient the crystal.

301
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,625
Hence, more power.

302
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,500
I didn't think
it was that simple.

303
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,666
It is. Though, that's where
the simplicity ends.

304
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,750
Tuning them is
extremely difficult.

305
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,708
So we use mined crystals
for mass-production units.

306
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,166
They tend to be less powerful,

307
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,250
but they are far more
stable and safe.

308
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,958
If mass-production is the goal,
it makes perfect sense.

309
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,041
But let's say you wanted
to create your own unique,

310
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,333
special Silhouette Knight.

311
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,333
You would have to use
something else, right?

312
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
Something like a huge
catalyst crystal taken from

313
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,166
one of the biggest
demon beasts you could find!

314
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,416
Your former highness,

315
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,458
I know just the
demon beast that qualifies.

316
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,083
I'd be eternally grateful
if you'd let me use

317
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,250
the behemoth
for my personal project.

318
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,916
I think we can come to
some arrangement.

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,375
But only the Alvs can create
the reactor for you.

320
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,791
It could take some time
before they're free to.

321
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,958
I've already got an idea that
I think will solve everything.

322
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,333
[AMBROSIUS]
Very well.

323
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,750
The victories were
yours to begin with.

324
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,250
The hearts of the behemoth
and queen shellcased

325
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,125
are yours to use as you wish.

326
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,541
Aaah! Thank you, your highness!

327
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,625
[SELESTINA] In order to
master the Ether Reactor's

328
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,666
creation method, Ernesti
would remain in Alfheim.

329
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,041
Ambrosius informed the Order of
the Silver Phoenix, however...

330
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,250
What do you mean
Ernie's staying here?

331
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,000
Can I stay, too, please?

332
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,875
He is our commander--
we should be at his side.

333
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,458
Please, your grace. Give us
permission to stay at the Fort.

334
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,083
Do as you like.
It's not as if you'd listen

335
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,166
if I told you otherwise, right?

336
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,041
--[DIETRICH, HELVI] Right!
--[ALL] Yeah!

337
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,541
[SELESTINA] Ernie studied.
What was once only a dream,

338
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,583
was almost within his reach.

339
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,000
His passion and the speed
at which he absorbed

340
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,541
the secret knowledge
was so astounding,

341
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,375
even the Alvs were amazed.

342
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,416
The Great Elder said
Ernie couldn't learn

343
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,875
their secrets in a lifetime.

344
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,041
But he mastered them
after only three months.

345
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,958
[ERNESTI]
Thank you for everything!

346
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,833
[KITLEY] It's intriguing.
You're a Changing One,

347
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,583
yet you see
the laws of existence

348
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,791
through completely
different eyes.

349
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,750
[gasps]

350
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,291
[KITLEY] If you live as long
as I suspect you will,

351
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,750
we shall meet again.

352
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:16,250
[bird caws]

353
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,250
[ERNESTI]
Hey!

354
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,666
--No.
--[ERNESTI] Addy!

355
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,541
[ADELTRUD gasps]

356
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,708
[ERNESTI laughs]

357
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,250
Ernie? Ernie!

358
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,708
[ADELTRUD]
I missed you so much!

359
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,666
[sobbing]

360
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,916
[ARCHID]
Hey!

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,750
[BATSON]
Welcome back!

362
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,541
[DAVID]
About damn time!

363
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,916
--[DIETRICH] Hey, Ernesti!
--[HELVI] You made it!

364
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,833
[EDGAR]
Welcome back!

365
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,375
[SELESTINA]
At last, Ernesti and his friends

366
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,041
returned to Fort Orobesius,
and began the process

367
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,000
of making his dream
Silhouette Knight a reality.

368
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,791
[DAVID] You know, Bat. I think
we can improve the efficiency.

369
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,416
Connecting pipes I-12 and H-6
oughta do the trick, right?

370
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,458
Knock it off! That's the tenth
time you've asked me that!

371
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,583
Have you seen
Ernie around recently?

372
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,583
Yeah! He's in the usual spot!

373
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,500
Thank you! Figures.

374
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,375
[NORA] A disturbing rumor
has been circulating

375
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,958
through the Occidents
as of late.

376
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,875
One of them is
planning something.

377
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,250
Perhaps a hostile takeover.

378
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,583
[ERNESTI] Does it have
something to do with

379
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,583
the raiders at Fort Casadesus?

380
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,541
[NORA]
It's entirely possible.

381
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,083
Understood. If the rumors
turn into fact,

382
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,166
please let me know immediately.

383
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,250
[gasps]

384
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,791
I assume you're looking for
Commander Ernesti? Inside.

385
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,500
Hold on! The two of you
talk an awful lot.

386
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,125
And in secret!

387
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,625
If you have
something to tell him,

388
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,375
you should go through
his aides. Like me!

389
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,125
Don't worry, sweetie.

390
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,125
I have no romantic
interest in Ernesti.

391
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,583
I just report to him.

392
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,250
I'm Nora Frykberg
of the Azure Hawk.

393
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,666
I'm a spy on
an important mission.

394
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,458
That mission just happens
to involve Ernesti.

395
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,958
My information is vital
and must be shared privately.

396
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,208
You're the only person
I've told any of this to,

397
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,250
other than
the commander himself.

398
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,666
Keep it a secret.

399
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
Uh. Uh.

400
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,666
[chuckles]

401
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,958
Guess who?

402
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,958
Hey! I know that it's you, Addy.

403
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,500
Now, quit. I'm doing
delicate work here.

404
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,291
You've been cooped up
for too long.

405
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,750
Let's have fun somewhere!

406
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,083
[ERNESTI]
You know, you're right!

407
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,666
Let's invite Kid and Bat, too!

408
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,750
[ADELTRUD]
Eh. Not what I had in mind.

409
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,375
[SELESTINA]
Finally...

410
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:49,458
[DAVID] Slowly, you clods!
Scratch it and you die!

411
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:58,291
[clanking]

412
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,625
[BATSON]
Intake and outtake pipes

413
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,500
attached and secured, boss!

414
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,708
The Silver Nerves
are ready to go!

415
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,208
[ERNESTI]
Thanks, great work!

416
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,291
[ERNESTI] Primary converter
reactor Queen's Coronet: on.

417
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,541
All clear. Now firing up
Behemoth's Heart.

418
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,541
Activation confirmed.
Mana intakes to all parts clear.

419
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,916
No errors. Adjust range
of motion and output margins.

420
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,916
Reactor ratios 2% and up.

421
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,791
[ERNESTI]
All values stable!

422
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,916
[ERNESTI] Now is the moment
that I've waited for.

423
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,375
Awaken, my partner.

424
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,875
Ikaruga!

425
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,625
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "Force &amp; Justice"!

426
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,875
The Ikaruga is calling me!
