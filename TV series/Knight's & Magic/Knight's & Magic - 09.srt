1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,500
[CARLITOS] Stand proud,
my valiant Black Knights.

2
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,458
You are the pride of
the Zaloudek Kingdom!

3
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,166
I am thrilled beyond measure
to share this moment with you.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,291
Remember it well.

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,500
Long ago,

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,583
these western lands were
ruled as one nation.

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,541
With one king
presiding over all!

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,750
The name of that
kingdom was Phadaabaden.

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,750
Today, we are all that remains
of that great legacy.

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,125
Which means the west
is our birthright!

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,666
[SOLDIERS cheer]

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,458
The time has come!

13
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,416
We will reunite this land!

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,333
And any who oppose us
will be crushed under foot!

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,791
[SOLDIERS cheer]

16
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,541
[SELESTINA]
On this day in history,

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,458
Carlitos Bilt Zaloudek,
eldest son of Bardomelow,

18
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,000
King of Zaloudek, declared war

19
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,375
on the surrounding nations
of the Occident.

20
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,458
It was the beginning
of what future generations

21
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:10,333
would come to know as
the Western Grand Storm.

22
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,958
[SOLDIERS]
Glory to Zaloudek!

23
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,500
[NOBLE 9A] I was certain
the Locar Federation

24
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,625
would hold out longer
than a mere month.


25
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,416
[NOBLE 9B] The "Federation"
is just a collection


26
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,083
of tiny nations. They're no
match for Zaloudek's might.

27
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,875
Even so, it should
have taken longer

28
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,083
than a month to overcome them.

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,500
I agree.

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,208
Something must have
happened in Zaloudek

31
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,958
to embolden them.

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,166
Something that would
quickly enhance their power

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,458
and drive them to ambition.

34
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,250
In any case, they'll
be coming here soon.

35
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,583
Shild Trider's defenses
must be reinforced!

36
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,333
So, it's true?

37
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,958
[AUGUSTI]
Eleonora.

38
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,041
I heard the servants gossiping.

39
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,750
They said that war is
practically at our gates.

40
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,958
There's no need to
concern yourself, my dear.

41
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,958
Shild Trider's walls have
always stood strong.

42
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,291
We'll send those invaders
home in stitches.

43
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,750
Thank you for that, Father.

44
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,791
I'm sorry for worrying.

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,291
[crashing]

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,375
[PILOT 9A] Their moves
are totally different!

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,166
[PILOT 9B]
Where'd they get this power?

48
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,041
[PILOT 9A gasps]
What the...? Look out!

49
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,416
[PILOTS scream]

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,916
[SOLDIERS scream]

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,583
[SELESTINA]
Using the Tyranto.

52
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,333
Zaloudek's new cutting-edge
Silhouette Knight.

53
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,750
The Black Knights broke through

54
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,083
the Kingdom of Kuschpercha
with brutal efficiency.

55
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,625
[SELESTINA] But then the war
took an unexpected turn.

56
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,833
Zaloudek's rapid advance,
which had gone

57
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,541
virtually unopposed,
suddenly halted outside

58
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,708
the mighty walls
of Shild Trider.

59
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,000
There, they waited.
Silent as death.

60
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,458
When King Augusti of Kuschpercha
learned of this development,

61
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,291
he gathered his forces
at Shild Trider.

62
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,541
Here, they hoped they could
finally turn the tide of battle.

63
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,583
[CRISTOBAL]
It's time, Mardonnes.

64
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,958
Indeed, Highness.

65
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,875
I wish I could see their faces
as they realize their fate.

66
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
What... What are those?

67
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,708
Buzzards? No, wait.

68
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,791
Black ships coming
from the skies!

69
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,500
Incoming!

70
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,500
[CRISTOBAL laughs] Like pigs
to the slaughter, they come.

71
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,125
The Kuschperchans are more
foolish than I thought.

72
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,541
If they had known about
our Levitate ships,

73
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,458
I doubt they would
have gathered here.

74
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,875
Attention, proud Order
of the Bronze Wing,

75
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
this is Cristobal.

76
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,833
Tonight, we'll feast in
the halls of Shild Trider!

77
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,375
Show them the meaning of fear!

00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,125
[DOROTEO]
All Knight Runners to positon!

00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,666
We'll be dropping
the Tyrantos shortly!

[PILOTS groaning]

84
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
[SELESTINA] Never in the
history of this world

85
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,916
had there been an
attack from the sky.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,833
Kuschpercha was immediately
backed into a corner.

87
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,750
[PILOT 9C] Stand firm!
Defend the castle at all costs!

be a memory after tonight.

There's glory to be had.

I have the chance.

Thank you so much for
supporting my brother.

I only wish we could have
returned you to Fremmevilla.

I wish your mother could
have seen what a wise

and beautiful woman
you've grown into.

100

I am so proud of you,
and she would have been, too.

You must escape with
Martina and Isadola.

You're not coming?
What are you going to do?

103
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,708
As king, I must fulfill
my duties to the people.

No. You can't!
You have to leave!

Try to understand.

106
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,875
I cannot run and leave our
people to suffer these invaders.

107
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,166
Our Knights are fighting them,

108
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,333
and I should be there
to lead the charge.

109

Take care of her. For me.

Even if I die trying.

[AUGUSTI] Isadola,
she'll need your support

through all of this.

00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,750
Yes. Highness.

114
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm heading out!
Prepare the Royal mech!

In accordance with
the ancient ways,

I request a duel
with your commander!

[ISADOLA]
You brat.

Don't you get why his majesty
asked for something

131
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,958
as old-fashioned as a duel?

132
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,083
He's buying us time to escape!

133
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,708
If you go back, his sacrifice
will mean nothing!

135

[ISADOLA] You are heir to
the throne of Kuschpercha.

00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,083
Act like it!

But I don't want him to die!

in father's pla--!

Do you feel that pain?

It means you're still alive!
Get up and keep living for him!

[MARTINA]
We should keep moving.

00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,208
It's not safe for us here.

143
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
And by dawn, it will
be even worse.

00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,708
[AUGUSTI]
Bastards. What happened?

145
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,625
What kind of power made you
willing to become butchers?

[AUGUSTI] Well done,
young Prince of Zaloudek.

This battle is yours.

Now, end it!

You knew you would lose,
yet you fought with honor.

I respect that. Farewell.

155

[SELESTINA] By the time the
sun peeked over the horizon,

156
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,625
both the king of Kuschpercha
and Delvancul had fallen.

At the same time, Shild Trider,

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,833
which had stood as a bastion
of strength and pride

for so long, fell to
Zaloudek's might.

[CARLITOS]
Kuschpercha is no more.

161
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,250
The Occidents are
as good as mine, now.

162
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,625
Cristobal has taken to
commanding well, it would seem.

163
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,083
Yes, but he cannot be
trusted with politics.

164
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,500
Don't fail me, sister.

165
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Leave it to me, dear brother.

166
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,875
[MARTINA] We're close
to the Duchy's territory.

167
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,750
Once we cross the river,
we'll be safe.

168
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,041
We'd be there now if it
weren't for those ships.

169
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
But, no, they have
to buzz around us

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,875
like Gadflies in a pig's sty.

171
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,958
Such undignified words.

172
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,250
What would Emrys say
if he heard you?

173
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
"What are you waiting for?

174
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,291
Give them a good
whack, Isadola!"

175
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,500
[horse whinnies]

176
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,208
Why'd you stop?

177
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,708
Checkpoint.

178
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,083
What do we do?

179
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,583
[SOLDIER 9C] Who are you,
and where are you headed?

180
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,000
[BINDER]
My name's Binder.

181
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,916
I'm from the next village over.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,750
Just going to help
some relatives.

183
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,333
[SOLDIER 9C]
Huh. Well, isn't that sweet?

184
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,416
And I suppose these
delicate flowers

185
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,958
are nothing but farmhands, huh?

186
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,166
Either way, you might
as well turn back.

187
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,375
There are no relatives
left to help.

188
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,500
The Duchy is under
Zaloudek's control,

189
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,375
and Duke Fernando is dead.

190
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,000
I saw his head roll personally.

191
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
[BOTH gasp]

192
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,083
[ISADOLA]
How dare you!

193
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,666
Let go of her!

194
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
[SOLDIER 9C]
Oh, my.

195
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,250
For the wife of a farmer, your
arms are surprisingly gentle.

196
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,958
Isn't that right,
Princess Martina?

197
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,666
[ERNESTI] Young Master,
is something wrong?

198
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,750
[EMRYS] That checkpoint flag.
It's not Kuschperchan.

199
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,166
[SOLDIER 9D]
Huh? A carriage?

200
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,708
[SOLDIER 9D gasps]

201
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,916
[SOLDIER 9D]
No, what is that?

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,541
Excuse me!

203
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,791
We are the Silver Phoenix
Merchant Association!

204
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,666
We have trade goods and rare
trinkets from over the mountain!

205
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,375
[SOLDIER 9D]
As if we'd believe that!

206
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,541
What kind of merchants
use a monstrous carriage

207
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,166
like that for simple trading?

208
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,500
[ERNESTI]
There are lots of demon beasts

209
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,875
beyond the mountains!

210
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,000
Conventional covered wagons
simply won't do the jo--

211
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,625
[PILOT 9D]
Enough! Be quiet and don't move!

212
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,625
[PILOT 9E] We're searching
you and your cargo!

213
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,291
[ERNESTI]
Looks like the rumors had merit.

214
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,541
Something's wrong here.

215
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,250
[EMRYS]
Yeah, my old man's usually right

216
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,125
about these things.

217
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,375
You'll have to
excuse my ignorance.

218
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,750
I don't recognize that flag.
Is it Kuschperchan?

219
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,583
[SOLDIER 9D]
Kuschpercha is long gone!

220
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,416
This checkpoint and
everything beyond it

221
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,875
belongs to the
Kingdom of Zaloudek!

222
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,750
Well, Young Master!
You heard him.

223
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,333
If Kuschpercha is gone,
there's no point

224
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,750
wastin' my time with
the likes of you!

225
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,583
Howling...

226
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,208
[EMRYS]
Blast!

227
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,666
[PILOT 9D] They just broke
through with a single strike!

228
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,666
[ERNESTI] Now that's
not nice, Young Master!

229
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,083
This is diplomacy. Let's put
our best foot forward.

230
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,541
[ERNESTI] If you don't mind,
Ikaruga will join the fun!

231
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,250
It's your grand debut, so,

232
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,416
let's show them what you can do!

233
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,208
That's one down.

234
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125
[PILOT 9E gasps]
Damn it!

235
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,458
That's two.

236
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,208
[PILOT 9D]
Take this, you bastard!

237
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,416
[PILOT 9D]
What? How is this possible?

238
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Sub-arms alone shouldn't
stop a Tyranto!

239
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,041
And three.

240
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,916
[PILOTS yell]

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,041
Long-range, huh?
Sure, I'll play!

242
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,166
[PILOT 9G screams]

243
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,458
That's two more!

244
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,916
[PILOT 9H]
No! Stay away!

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,416
[PILOT 9H screams]

246
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,333
And, that's six! Who's next?

247
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,083
[SOLDIER 9D whimpers]
Spare us!

248
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,875
[EMRYS]
Ha. Not worth my time.

249
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,958
Ernie goes out and
before you know it,

250
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,875
their whole garrison's
surrendering.

251
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,208
[ARCHID]
Like you didn't see that coming.

252
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,416
[HELVI]
What's wrong, Edgar?

253
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,166
This new unit. Look familiar?

254
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,583
[HELVI, DIETRICH gasp]

255
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,750
[DIETRICH] Back weapons!
And strand-type crystal tissue!

256
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,125
[HELVI] Well, now we know
how Zaloudek got so strong.

257
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,000
[ERNESTI] Are you talking
Silhouette Knights?

258
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,291
You can't talk robots
without me around!

259
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,833
Now let's see.

260
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,416
You guessed right, though.

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,416
The technology used in this unit
is the same as the Telestale.

262
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,541
And I think we all know
where it came from.

263
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,458
[EDGAR]
They stole Helvi's Trandorkis.

264
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,333
It didn't deserve that.

265
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,333
So, the thieves from Casadesus

266
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,583
were connected to Zaloudek
somehow. Unforgiveable!

267
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,750
Don't worry, they'll
get their comeuppance.

268
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,000
At least we know what
happened to the Trandorkis.

269
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,541
And, since they're obviously
stealing our ideas,

270
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,375
it's safe to assume
this unit is ours, too.

271
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,666
Which means, it's okay
for us to take it!

272
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,000
What? Hold on.

273
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,416
That's not very Knightly.
Let's think about it.

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,041
I wouldn't expect any less
from ol' silver hair.

275
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,416
Fess up. You want to take a peek

276
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,166
at the enemy mech, too,
don't ya, boss?

277
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,958
You're damn right!

278
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,166
What's the plan, "Young Master"?

279
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
Well, we're Merchant's, right?

280
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,166
So, we'll stick to our business,
and beat the living crap

281
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,958
out of anybody who
stands in our way.

282
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,041
That sounds good!

283
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,583
Maybe I'll actually
get to fight.

284
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,958
What is our business, exactly?

285
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,833
What do all merchants want?

286
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,625
Lots and lots of
product! [laughs]

287
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,750
[SELESTINA] Shortly afterwards,
soldiers in the Zaloudek army

288
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,625
began to whisper of a
monstrous horse and rider

289
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,125
that ferried the grim
reaper himself.

290
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:39,833
He wore a demon mask and hunted
along the eastern road.

291
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,625
[CRISTOBAL] Let's get one
thing straight, Princess.

292
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,875
I'm not here out of concern.

293
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,000
And I don't like small talk.

294
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,083
So, I'll just get
straight to the point.

295
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,500
You're going to be
my wife. End of story.

296
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
N-No, I won't!

297
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,791
You think you have a choice?

298
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,041
If you try my patience,
I'll drug you until you comply!

299
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,166
And if you keep acting up,

300
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,041
I'll just kill you and make
the other girl my queen.

301
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,041
Your choice.

302
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,333
Isadola? You can't!

303
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,875
[ELEONORA]
Father. I need you.

304
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,791
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

305
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,708
[CRISTOBAL]
Tch. What a pathetic girl.

306
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,375
How can I punish her
if she won't fight back?

307
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,666
[DOROTEO] You're not
calling off the wedding,

308
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,083
Your Highness?

309
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,416
I'm not that stupid.

310
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,416
If I throw a wrench
in my sister's plan,

311
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,958
I may as well slit my throat.

312
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,208
What's your take on
the rumors of late?

313
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,833
This "Demon-Masked Reaper"?

314
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,000
Probably just Kuschperchan
rebels causing mischief.

315
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,333
They'll vanish, eventually.

316
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,333
Take them out!
Or I'll do it myself--

317
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,208
No, Highness, you mustn't.

318
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,416
You shouldn't involve yourself
with such trivial matters.

319
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,083
It would only validate
their rebellion.

320
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,291
If it's trivial,

321
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,750
you shouldn't have
a problem crushing them.

322
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,208
Damn it all.

323
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,875
What am I to do
about this prince?

324
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,291
[KERHILT] Sounds like you're
in quite the rough spot.

325
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,291
I wouldn't mind
getting involved.

326
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,000
Your sending that
idiot son of yours

327
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,625
to look for the rebels?

328
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,000
I can watch his back.
Keep him safe.

329
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,166
If what I've heard about
the Bronze Fang is true,

330
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,666
I would welcome your help.

331
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,833
[KERHILT] Very well. I'll
find this "Reaper" for you.

332
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,250
And once I have, you can
swoop in and kill it.

333
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,833
Not a bad deal,
wouldn't you agree?

334
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,541
[SELESTINA] Thanks to reports
from Nora of the Azure Hawk,

335
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,416
the Silver Phoenix
found out about

336
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,833
Princess Eleonora's plight,
and was moved to action.

337
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,250
Gah, I wish this
was Cristobal's face.

338
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,375
A death that quick would
be way too merciful.

339
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,375
If he lays one finger on her...

340
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,083
[ERNESTI]
We won't let him.

341
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,708
Now finish up, because we've
got a princess to rescue!

342
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,416
[SELESTINA] Just as Ernesti was
putting his plan into motion,

343
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,791
Zaloudek's army
deployed Levitate ships

344
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,000
to locate and destroy him.

345
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,208
[gasps] Seriously?

346
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,208
[PILOT 9I] Yes. Just like
the Bronze Order said.

347
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,833
[GUSTAV]
So those are the riders carrying

348
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,541
the grim reaper, eh?

349
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,458
Supposedly, they have
a powerful Knight

350
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,583
with them, as well.

351
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,500
But I doubt they'll
prove a challenge.

352
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,833
After today, I,
Gustav Mardonnes,

353
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,750
will be known as the man
who conquered death.

354
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,291
[SOLDIER 9E] Captain D!
Two flying ships approaching!

355
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,250
Didn't think it
was possible, but,

356
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,666
I guess Ernie's not
the only person

357
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,041
who can make crazy
machines like that.

358
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,416
Pretty sure that crest
is Zaloudek, too.

359
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,583
That rules out any chance
that they're friendly.

360
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,333
Prepare for a
long-range assault, boys!

361
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,000
[DIETRICH] We shoot first.
Light up the sky!

362
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,833
I guess they're not intimidated
by the Levitate ships.

363
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,125
They might actually
be a challenge.

364
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,125
I'm sending out the
Silhouette Knights!

365
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,333
We'll finish them
with our blades!

366
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,083
[DIETRICH]
More of those copy-cat Mechs.

367
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,583
You Black Knights are nothing
but cowardly thieves.

368
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,875
I have no reason to fear you!

369
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,583
But you have every
reason to fear our wrath!

370
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,666
Prepare to meet your maker!

371
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,291
[PILOT 9I] He's totally
different than those

372
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,833
Kuschperchan training dummies!

373
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,750
[DIETRICH]
You blocked it. Not bad.

374
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,791
But no matter how
thick your armor,

375
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,083
it can't match a behemoth!

376
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,125
[PILOTS gasp]

377
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,083
[GUSTAV]
Get outta here, weaklings!

378
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,458
The glory for this
kill belongs to me!

379
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,750
[DIETRICH]
Wh-What the hell, man?

380
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,916
Think you have enough swords?
What's the point of that?

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,958
Why else would I
have this many?

382
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,541
Swords are strong!

383
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,375
Therefore, the more I have,
the stronger I'll be!

384
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,791
It's logic!

385
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:58,166
[DIETRICH] Oh, I get it.
You're just some massive idiot.

386
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,083
You have a nice
pair of blades, too.

387
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,750
But, they won't help!

388
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,625
None who face the
Swordsman survive!

389
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,833
He might be an idiot,
but he's got skill!

390
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,708
[GUSTAV laughs]
So slow! Come on!

391
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,291
You might as well
be standing still!

392
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,750
I'm already bored, so I
think I'll finish you off!

393
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,416
It does look like I'm
at a disadvantage here.

394
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,958
But you're all alone.

395
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,208
Sending your goons away
was a bad move.

396
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,083
Huh?

397
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,041
[HELVI yells]

398
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,666
[groans]

399
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,541
What, did you think all I did
was haul that carriage around?

400
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,125
Think again, creep!

401
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,833
Damn you! You'll pay for that!

402
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,416
[DIETRICH] Where'd that
smoke bomb come from?

403
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
[GUSTAV]
What are you trying to pull?

404
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,250
Till next time!

405
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,416
[DIETRICH]
Wait!

406
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,500
[DIETRICH]
Shoot them down!

407
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,375
[GUSTAV] Hey, crimson!
You weren't half bad!

408
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,750
Honor demands a rematch,
so don't die until then!

409
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,208
[DIETRICH]
Those flying ships are cheating.

410
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,375
Not to mention a major problem.

411
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,208
If we'll be dealing
with them from now on,

412
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,583
Ernesti will have to make
an effective counter measure.

413
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,166
Ah!

414
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,250
[KERHILT] Never thought I'd
see Gustav the Sword-Lover

415
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,708
put up against a wall.

416
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,458
That smoke bomb
was you, wasn't it?

417
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,916
How long have you been here?

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,333
Couldn't say.

419
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,541
[GUSTAV]
I don't need help.

420
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,041
Oh? So that withdrawl
was strategic?

421
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,875
I'll thank you this time.

422
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,125
But it won't happen again.

423
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,416
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "War and Princess"!

424
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,916
The drums of war are calling me!
