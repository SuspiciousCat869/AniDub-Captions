[SELESTINA]
The merchant city of Fontanie

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,291
was once a beacon of prosperity.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,791
But sadly, once it fell
to Zaloudek's army,

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,500
the radiant city vanished

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,166
and was replaced
by cold desolation.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,833
[EMRYS]
I hardly recognize the place.

7
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,166
Last time I was here,
every day was like a festival.

The silver phoenix...

[whispering] Keep it down, Addy!

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,458
[ARCHID] They were watching us
more closely than I expected.

14
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,625
[sighs] It's a good thing
we snuck in separately.

15
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,166
How's our "product"
coming along, Nora?

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,541
They're ready and
waiting, Young Master.

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,208
You all know what to do.

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,666
The royal family's
suffered long enough.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's roll out!

20
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,166
[KOJASS]
That mech just flew!

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,125
It wasn't launched,
it actually flew!

22
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,708
[EDGAR] Now, Aldirat.
Show her your power!

Young Master, can you keep up?


26
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,375
Yeah, this is easy!

Thanks.

29
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,041
Think nothing of it, Highness.

30
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,375
[ERNESTI] According to intel,
the princess is being kept

31
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,916
in the top floor of
a tower in that castle.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
[ADELTRUD]
Hold on, there are four towers!

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,375
[NORA] Security was so tight,
I couldn't find out

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,125
which one she was in, sadly.

35
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,833
So, I guess that gives us
a one in four chance?

36
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,166
[ERNESTI]
Yeah.

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,208
But, to be safe, we'll hit
all four towers at once.

38

[SOLDIER 10A] I'm tellin' you,
they were out to here!

[SOLDIER 10B]
Damn! Which bar was this?

40
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,791
[ERNESTI] Nora. We'll
need an escape route.

41
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,416
Consider it done.

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,458
[ERNESTI]
Go in hard and get out fast.

Sorry for the intrusion.

I'm guessing you're
Lady Martina?

48
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,166
You are?

49
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,875
I mean you no harm.

00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,208
The opposite, in fact.
I'm Ernesti Echevalier.

Knight Commander of the
Order of the Silver Phoenix.

Considering your wild entrance
and calm disposition,

53
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,583
I assume that you're
from my homeland.

54
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,125
You should be rescuing
the princess, not me.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,958
[SOLDIER 10C]
Hey! What was that racket?

56
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,333
Please, don't worry.

57
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,958
My friends will have her soon.

58
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,208
In that case, lead the way.

[SOLDIER 10C]
Who the hell are you?

Sir Knight, shall we go?

61
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,250
I'm sorry if this
gets a little rough.

62
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
Now hold on tight.

63
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,375
[ISADOLA] Cousin Rys!
Is it you or am I dreaming?

64
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,291
Hey, now. No waterworks.

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,958
We still have to
get outta here.

00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,291
Come on, I'll carry you.

67
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,583
Okay!

I'm looking for the princess.

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,875
Is that you, by any chance?

75
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,166
It is. And, you are?

Sorry, there's no time.

My homeland is all
but a memory, now.

There's no one I can rely on.

Even if I go with you.
I have nothing left.

Please, leave me be.

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,958
I won't tell anyone
about you. Just go.

No real power to speak of.

I'm here proves that!

You have the power to
drive people to action!

The same way you moved me!
You just have to use it!

You believe that?

Sure do! And, from
now on, you have us!

We'll protect you, I swear it!

I'm not worthy of being
protected by anyone.

If people were to
suffer because of me,

I couldn't live with it.

you think this way?

no doubt head east

There are no Kuschperchan
remnants to the west. Clever.

Also, there's that so-called

out of the east, as well.

It's possible they're

162
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,708
we can use them to test the
true might of my creation!

163
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,291
[KOJASS laughs]
Drink up, men!

164
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,750
The Ether is fine!

165
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,791
[SELESTINA] The next day,
the Levitate Ship

166
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,541
of Doloteo Mardonnes found
the Order of the Silver Phoenix

167
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,000
and quickly intercepted them.

168
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,875
Prepare Tyrantos for launch!

169
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,291
Helm, move us
directly above them!

170
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,625
[ARCHID]
Heads up, guys.

171
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,791
[ADELTRUD] That must be
what D told us about.

172
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,125
I can't believe they
already found us.

173
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,958
Damn flying ships!

174
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,083
[ERNESTI]
It's so wonderful!

175
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,458
It's not a blimp or a balloon,

176
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,041
but an actual ship that
sails through the sky!

177
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,125
Beautiful!

178
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,583
But how did they
even come up with it?

179
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,083
I have the advantage
of knowledge

180
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,333
they could never possess

181
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,541
and yet they have somehow
carved themselves

182
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,583
a path in the sky!

183
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,500
[ERNESTI]
It's too much!

184
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,041
I have to see it up close!

185
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,458
What the...?
Somethin's coming at us!

186
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,125
Is it a projectile?

187
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,375
No, it's too big.

188
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,833
[SOLDIER 10E screams]
It's him! The demon!

189
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,958
[BOTH gasp]

190
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,208
[BOTH yelp]

191
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,375
[ERNESTI] It's more
incredible than I hoped!

192
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,750
It uses wind magic as
a source of propulsion!

193
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,250
So innovative!

194
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,333
But that shouldn't be enough
to keep its weight airborne.

195
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,750
How do they compensate?

196
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,541
I have so many questions now!

197
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,958
That mech just flew!

198
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,208
It wasn't launched,
it actually flew!

199
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,625
Somebody other than myself

200
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,791
used a completely different
design philosophy

201
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,791
and accomplished it without
sails or air magic!

202
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,916
General! I need to see more!

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,208
Shake that bastard off!

204
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,625
[ERNESTI]
Whoa!

205
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,000
[SOLDIER 10F]
Die, monster!

206
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,750
[SOLDIER 10D] All the Tyrantos
have been wiped out!

207
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,375
Put everything into the engines!

208
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,000
Take us back to Fontanie!

209
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,583
Not yet! I haven't gotten
a good look at it!

210
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,375
It's really flying.

211
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,958
[laughs]

212
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,125
How dare it try to
encroach on my sky!

213
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,833
[laughs]

214
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,375
[ERNESTI]
Hey! Where are you going?

215
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,666
All right, then.

216
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,166
But you haven't seen
the last of me, air ship!

217
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,750
[KOJASS]
The sky is mine.

218
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,250
Mine, and no one else's!
I claimed it!

219
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,750
Whoever you are, you'll soon
learn how reckless it is

220
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,583
to try and take it from me!

221
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,333
The next time we meet
it will be your end!

222
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,000
[SELESTINA]
The Western Grand Storm would be

223
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,500
one of history's most
notorious conflicts,

224
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,166
and the genius of both
Ernesti and Lord Kojass'

225
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,625
would be at the core of it all.

226
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,458
[CRISTOBAL]
Why even bother coming back?

227
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,875
[DOLOTEO grunting]

228
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,208
[DOLOTEO]
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

229
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,083
That's quite enough barbarism.

230
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,791
It's turning my stomach.

231
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,666
[CRISTOBAL growls] There's no
way those Kuschperchan mutts

232
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,583
pulled off something so brazen.

233
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,708
So, who did this?
The Eleven Flags?

234
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,875
Or maybe those weaklings
from the Locar Federation?

235
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,625
[DOLOTEO] I'm afraid our
adversary won't be as easy

236
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,708
to deal with as they were.

237
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,916
Why's that?

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,583
They were monsters.

239
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,166
Two of their Silhouette Knights
were like a horse and rider,

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,000
racing down the road
at incredible speeds

241
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,875
while pulling large chariots.

242
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,458
And inside the chariot
is the true terror.

243
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,416
A demonic Knight
wreathed in flame,

244
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,750
flying on wings of death.

245
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,458
What sort of nonsense
are you spouting now?

246
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,750
[CATARINA] A flying Silhouette
Knight? That's impossible.

247
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,625
[KOJASS]
I assure you, it isn't.

248
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,166
I saw it darting around
like a gadfly myself.

249
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,458
My Levitate Ship could
do nothing but run.

250
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,916
It was upsetting.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,666
[DOLOTEO] Duke Fernando's
wife and daughter

252
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
were among the royals who fled.

253
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,666
The duchess hails from beyond
the mountains to the east.

254
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,291
She's the daughter of Ambrosius,

255
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,083
the former King of Fremmevilla.

256
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,291
The beast guards?

257
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,583
That would explain a lot.

258
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,875
But it won't stop me from
making Eleonora my wife.

259
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,000
And if they resist, I'll wipe
Fremmevilla off the map!

260
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,000
[SELESTINA] Ernesti's knights
met up with the rest

261
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,750
of the Order at Nishirie,
a relay station

262
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,458
on the old Kuschperchan highway.

263
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,458
Welcome back.

264
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,208
That was exhausting.

265
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,375
That was easy.
Don't be a wimp.

266
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,000
We both know you were
just acting tough

267
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,416
for your precious princess.

268
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,916
Uh!

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,291
[LETONMAKI] Your Highness!
Thank goodness you're safe.

270
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,500
Baron Letonmaki, it's good
to see that you are safe.

271
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,250
And you, Viscount Bekkel.

272
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,875
I only wish we had died
instead of the King.

273
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,000
But... it hasn't been
all bad news, of late.

274
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,958
This young merchant
recently approached us

275
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,166
with an interesting proposal.

276
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,583
Merchant?

277
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,041
Knight. I think
you'd better explain.

278
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,041
Of course. Why don't
we head inside, first?

279
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,375
Understand.

280
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,375
The Kuschperhcan Silhouette
Knight, the Lesvant,

281
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,666
is a solid mech with
a great history.

282
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,500
Though, compared to the
new Zaloudek units,

283
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,666
they fall behind in
firepower and endurance.

284
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,791
But don't worry.

285
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,416
The Silver Phoenix
Merchant Association

286
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,375
can offer a solution.

287
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,208
All the details are
in those reports.

288
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,625
Interesting.

289
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
How do you plan to
get the materials?

290
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,666
Oh, that's the best part.

291
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,625
My "brokers" are among the
most talented in Fremmevilla.

292
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,541
They'll get everything
we need from the enemy.

293
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,083
Ah. I see.

294
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,500
Well, Princess?
What are your thoughts?

295
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,500
It seems good.

296
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,208
Young Knight.

297
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,208
If this is indeed a trade, then
you'll want something in return.

298
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,583
What might that be?

299
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,250
Silhouette Knights.

300
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,333
More specifically,
any of the enemy units

301
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,250
our order captures or destroys.

302
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,916
We want exclusive rights
to their parts and chassis'.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,791
Nothing more.

304
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
Not a bad deal,
all things considered.

305
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,291
[ERNESTI]
Thank you, Duchess. Now then.

306
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,833
We'll be heading out to rip,
break, and crush the enemy!

307
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,375
Keep the place warm
until we get back, 'kay?

308
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,750
[EMRYS chuckles]

309
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
[OFFICER 10A]
That's not Kuschperchan.

310
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,166
Well, whoever they are,
they're on the wrong side.

311
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,750
Get in there and
teach them a lesson!

312

[SOLDIERS yell]

313
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,541
[OFFICER 10A]
Glory to Zaloudek!

314
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,625
[OFFICER 10A]
Kuschperchan scarecrows?

315
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,666
They look different.

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Shoot now!

317
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,125
[SOLDIERS screaming, groaning]

318
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,750
[OFFICER 10A]
All units... retreat!

319
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,375
I don't believe it.

Hey!

be easy enough to make.

But, I gotta ask. Does the
Ikaruga really need it?

329
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,041
I won't be the one using it.

330
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,625
Since I'm the only
one who can fly,

331
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,333
I figured everyone else
could use anti-air weapons.

Well, if she was a mech,

00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,166
I could figure out most of
her problems by listening
