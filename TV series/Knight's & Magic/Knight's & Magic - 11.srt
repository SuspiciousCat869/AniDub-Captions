1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,000
[CRISTOBAL] You found
that sniveling princess?

2
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,250
Then what are we waiting for?

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,666
[CATARINA]
Wait, brother. Sit this one out.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,500
Let the soldiers handle it.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,125
Not after what she's
put me through.

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,875
First, I'll destroy her,
then the rest of her army!

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,958
And I'll make the Silver
Phoenix watch as I do it!

8
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,416
[ERNESTI] ...will
automatically belong to us.

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,041
[CRISTOBAL] Wait! Is that
some kind of cruel joke?

10
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,833
[KOJASS]
Consider it a guarantee

11
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,208
from the true ruler
of the skies.

12
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,500
[SELESTINA]
Zaloudek's army moved swiftly.

13
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,833
Cristobal's forces,
composed of both

14
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,291
the Order of the Black Jaw
and Bronze Wing,

15
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,000
passed through Fontanie,
the land of the former

16
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,583
Duke Fernado, into Baron
Letonmaki's territory.

17
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,041
After brutally
destroying Fontanie,

18
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,333
Zaloudek closed in on Nishirie
and Princess Eleonora.

19
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,541
[CRISTOBAL]
It's so quiet.

20
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,583
Are those cowards just
quivering behind their walls?


21
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,750
I expected a fight.


22
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,541
[KOJASS]
The demon hasn't shown himself?

23
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,458
I'll be severely
disappointed if we came

24
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,125
all this way for nothing.

25
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,500
Please, my lord.
Don't stand so close.

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,500
The windows are vulnerable.

27
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,375
Is there any chance we could
lower altitude, helmsman?

28
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,875
I can barely make anything
out from up here.

29
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,000
Our only job here is escorting
Prince Cristobal, sir.

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,916
Unless we're told
to do otherwise...

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,458
We can't interfere
with the battle, I know.

32
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,166
But you'd better hope
it comes out soon.

33
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't make this trip
just to sightsee.

34
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,958
[CRISTOBAL] I think we've
given them plenty of time

35
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,250
to prepare for their deaths.
Begin the attack.

36
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,416
Sire!

37
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,333
Show time.

38
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,416
And what do we have here?

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,791
What?

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,291
There they are!

41
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,958
[ADELTRUD]
Plain as day!

42
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,416
[ADELTRUD, ARCHID] Anti-Air
Weapon, Misshire Javelin!

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,166
Fire!

44
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,750
Fire!

45
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,166
[OFFICER 11A] Ships five
and seven are damaged!

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,166
They can't maintain altitude!

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,708
Spears can't reach this high!

48
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,000
How'd they do that?

49
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,750
[gasps] An impressive invention!

50
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,625
Jeez, they're heavy.

51
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,208
'Kay! You're good to go!

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,833
[ADELTRUD]
Have another helping, jerks!

53
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,166
[SOLDIER 11B]
We lost ship four!

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,791
[SOLDIER 11A]
Stay close to the flagship!

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,750
We must protect the prince!

56
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,583
So that's how you want
to play this game?

57
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,083
[OFFICER 11B]
Curse those Kuschperchan dogs

58
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
and their cowardly weapons!

59
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,000
Purge the Tyrantos! Quickly!

60
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,833
But, sir, the pilots
are still in them!

61
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,083
We're too high up!

62
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,750
If we can't get out of
range of those spears,

63
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,916
we're doomed! Lighten
the ship, damn you!

64
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,583
I've been waiting for
this moment, Zaloudek.

65
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,375
[EDGAR]
First company, open fire!

66
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,541
You're through. I won't
let you any further.

67
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,208
They were waiting.

68
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,375
It's a trap, and I
fell right into it.

69
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,583
They've made a fool of me!

70
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,916
[ERNESTI]
Looks like the Misshire Javelins

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,416
are working as
intended. Excellent.

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
And Edgar's company is
cleaning up their drop force

73
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,500
without any issues.

74
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,166
Time for me to add
the finishing touches.

75
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,291
[laughs]

76
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,166
[ERNESTI]
That's one! Who's next!

77
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,291
Look at him. Glad
I'm not those guys.

78
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,750
Yeah, no kidding.

79
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,166
Having a flying Silhouette
Knight almost feels unfair.

80
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,291
It's like we're adding
salt to a wound.

81
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,166
Stupid. This is just stupid!

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,833
Like some sort of
bad joke! Look at him!

83
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,250
Using explosive power
to fly through the air.

84
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,000
It's so... barbaric!

85
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,208
He trespasses on
my sky and mocks me?!

86
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,708
[SOLDIER 11D] Ships two and
three have taken heavy hits.

87
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,208
We've lost our formation!

88
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,458
Highness.

89
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,125
We should leave before
we lose any more ships!

90
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,666
[CRISTOBAL]
Stay your tongue!

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,625
If I retreat, my sister
won't let me live it down.

92
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,375
Now, contact the Order
of the Black Jaw.

93
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,333
Wipe out the town
and the princess!

94
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,625
Sire!

95
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,583
[OFFICER 11C]
Advance! Crush these rebel scum!

96
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,250
[EMRYS]
Scum?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,833
You're the thugs killing
innocents for your own gain.

98
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,583
Mark my words, Zaloudek.

99
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,291
you'll pay for every
last one of 'em!

100
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,166
[PILOT 11A]
The Golden Silhouette Knight!

101
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,083
[OFFICER 11C] Calm down!
He just looks imposing!

102

[EMRYS]
Howling Blast!

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,375
[OFFICER 11C]
What is this?

104
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,500
Come on.

105
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,458
The prince can't
have all the fun!

106
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,000
Second company, move out!

107
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,875
Keep the momentum!

108
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,375
We're punching a hole
in their flank

109
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,541
and cutting off their advance!

110
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,041
[PILOT 11B]
We're surrounded!

111
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,291
There's no way
to get to Nishirie!

112
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,916
[ERNESTI] So there's
plenty of time to play!

113
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,041
[ERNESTI] A battle between
Silhouette Knights is sacred.

114
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,125
Let's enjoy it.

115
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,416
[PILOT 11B]
The demon!

116
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,708
[PILOT 11B yelps]

117
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,666
[OFFICER 11A]
Majesty! Our allies!

118
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,041
The Black Jaw.

119
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,166
They've...

120
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,208
They've been...

121
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,083
[CRISTOBAL]
Enough! Say it already!

122
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,875
Their forces have been routed!

123
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,833
We've lost this fight, sire!

124
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,958
Change course.

125
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,250
[OFFICER 11A]
At once.

126
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,166
Damn you, Reaper.

127
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,333
Follow the flagship! Quickly!

128
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,250
[SOLDIER 11B]
Yes, sir!

129
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,375
[KOJASS]
Belay that order.

00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,916
[OFFICER 11D]
Lord?

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,875
[KOJASS] If we go now, we'll
just get in the prince's way.

132
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,166
Wait a moment. We'll catch up
once he's reached safety.

133
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,000
[ADELTRUD] Look! One of
their ships is fleeing!

Batson!

135
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,416
You're locked and loaded!

Let 'em have it, Kid!

137
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,583
You won't get away!

Blow Engines seven and
eleven are damaged, sir!

139
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,041
We're losing speed!

140
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,875
[OFFICER 11A]
It's the Demon!

[SOLDIERS scream]

142
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,833
Stop shaking like
a child, damn you.

143
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,416
There must be somebody
important on this ship.

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,333
Why else would you be
the first to turn tail

145
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,625
and run from the battle?

146
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,250
[CRISTOBAL]
Demon!

147
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,208
Setting foot on my ship
was your last mistake.

148
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,958
I am Cristobal, the
Second Prince of Zaloudek,

149
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,666
and I will be your doom!

150
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,875
You should be honored!

151
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,208
[ERNESTI]

Back weapons and
close-quarters combat gear.

153
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
It looks like a
standard Telestale,

154
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,416
except you've made
the face look so noble!

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,083
I hope that's not all,
or you're in trouble.

156
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,958
[CRISTOBAL]
Shut your mouth!

157

[CRISTOBAL]
Damn you!

Huh? It's no joke, I'm serious.

I'm also free to alter
export arrangements,

but it's a pain,
so I don't bother.

190
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,875
In times of necessity,
my orders can be prioritized

191
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,875
over the king himself,
so, as you can see,

00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,791
This device,
which they apparently

317
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,166
call an Ether Supplier,

318
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,541
can transform this Etherite
into high-density ether

319
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,416
at will for a sudden
burst of power!

320
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
That's an odd design.

321
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,875
[ERNESTI] In other words,
they can keep supplying fuel

322
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,666
without having to gather
it from the atmosphere.

323
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,166
This device is the reason
why the Tyranto units

324
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,333
are able to sustain
such incredible power

325
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,916
and seem to never
run out of mana.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,583
It's incredible!
A true masterpiece!

327
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,125
You do realize this
is the enemy's, right?

328
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,750
[ERNESTI] Of course, it has its
share of short-comings, too.

329
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,250
Just look at this degradation.

330
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,208
The high-density ether really
does a number on the supplier.

331
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,750
So much, in fact,
that they designed it

332
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,833
as a replaceable part.

333
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,375
But the Ether Reactor--
it's... the most important part

334
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,625
of a Silhouette Knight.
Like it's heart.

335
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,083
And they're tossing them
after just one use?

336
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,833
I doubt it was designed
to be a permanent core.

337
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,041
It's likely they only use it
during emergency situations.

338
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,291
Like wartime.

339
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,916
The amount of materials
they go through

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,916
must be staggering.

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,333
Oh, yeah!

342
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,333
I also figured out how their
"levitate ships" fly!

343
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,250
A device called
the Etheric Levitator

344
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,750
uses the natural behavior of
ether itself to defy gravity,

345
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,416
and achieves momentum
using air magic.

346
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,791
An "Etheric Levitator."

347
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,625
Another brilliant
piece of technology.

348
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,083
The amount of ether it
needs to properly function

349
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,833
must be astronomical!

350
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:32,666
It had a ton of Ether
Suppliers attached to it!

351
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,500
Unfortunately, even
the crew weren't told

352
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,666
exactly how it works,
so I can't know for sure.

353
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,333
The only person
with that knowledge

354
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,041
is the levitator's inventor,
Horatio Kojass.

355
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,541
I'd love to meet him!

356
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,041
I bet we could learn all kinds
of stuff from each other.

357
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,458
[DAVID]
Jeez, kid.

358
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,250
You got enough of that fearless
optimism to go around?

359
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,000
Some folks around here
could use a pinch or two.

360
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,708
[BATSON]
I know I could.

361
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,791
Here, Sir Knight. Say "ah."

362
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,750
Hold on. Please, Your Majesty.

363
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,041
Stop, everyone is looking at us!

364
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,041
Come on. It's one little bite.

365
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,875
[ARCHID]
Uh--

366
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,291
Kid's turning red. How cute!

367
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,458
[ERNESTI] Sorry to keep
you waiting so long.

368
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,875
Uh-- What are you doing?

369
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,000
Uh. Nothing!

370
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,375
Perfect timing! Join us!

371
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,750
Hey, help me out here.

372
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you need help with, man?

373
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,333
She is totally into you.

374
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,666
[MARTINA]
Never mind them, Ernesti.

375
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,166
We have some important
news to discuss.

376
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,375
[MARTINA]
It's going well.

377
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,250
All of our remaining forces have
regrouped here in Fontanie.

378
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,625
Thanks to you, of course.

379
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,500
Sadly, the enemy still
greatly outnumbers us,

380
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,416
and there's nothing we
can do to close that gap.

381
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,250
I know they belong to you
according to our contract,

382
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,666
but would you be
willing to give us

383
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,250
the remaining Silhouette
Knights you have claimed?

384
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,250
If we could rebuild them,
they'd be a boon to our forces.

385
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,000
I know we're asking
a lot of you, Ernie.

386
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,500
I don't have a problem with it.

387
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,375
Please, take whatever you need.

388
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,791
[BOTH gasp]

389
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,500
To be honest, it would
take way too long

390
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,833
to handle all those
Silhouette Knights

391
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,333
with the manpower we have.

392
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,625
If you're willing to help us
rebuild them, we'd be happy

393
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,958
to give you as many
as you need in return.

394
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,875
Beyond that, we'd be willing
to lend them to you

395
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,000
for the duration of the war,

396
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,916
and until Kuschpercha
is stabilized.

397
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,833
Does that sound like
a fair arrangement?

398
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,291
That's perfectly fine.

399
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,750
Thank you so much, Ernie.

400
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,583
We're grateful.

401
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,791
Okay then.

402
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,125
In that case, since
the Silhouette Knights

403
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,500
you'll be using
technically belong

404
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
to the Silver Phoenix,

405
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,375
any Silhouette Knights
you defeat with them

406
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,416
will automatically belong to us.

407
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
[BOTH gasp]

408
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,750
I was just joking! Really!

409
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,625
No, you weren't. Come on.

410
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,125
You're 100 percent serious.

411
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,583
This sucks.

412
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,333
Why don't we get to
have tea and cakes

413
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,666
with the royal family?

414
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,458
[DAVID] A Knightsmith
takes pride in working

415
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,125
in the background. Unnoticed.

416
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,458
Wait a minute,
David are you crying?

417
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,666
Crying is just sweat
of the heart.

418
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,416
[SELESTINA] With help from the
Order of the Silver Phoenix,

419
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
the army of the Reborn
Kuschperchan Kingdom devoted

420
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,500
all its energy to
expanding the military.

421
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,666
The Zaloudek, still
reeling from the loss

422
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,791
of the prince, lost their
momentum and the Kushperchans

423
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,750
began to push them back.
Several months passed.

424
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,125
[EDGAR]
This fortress now belongs

425
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,500
to the Reborn Kingdom
of Kushpercha!

426
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,208
Let 'em hear us in Zaloudek!

427
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,750
[SOLDIERS cheer]

428
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,500
[HELVI] That was easier
to take than I expected.

429
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,708
[EDGAR]
Yeah.

430
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,708
The Kuschperchan Knights
are getting better.

431
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,125
I'm proud of them.

432
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,791
Do you think the
others are okay?

433
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,666
I don't have reason to worry.

434
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,750
Ernesti and D are with them.
They couldn't be safer.

435
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,583
[SOLDIERS] Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!

436
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,541
[ADELTRUD] Mission accomplished!
That was a breeze!

437
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,166
[ERNESTI] Yeah, but there wasn't
a need for me to do anything.

438
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,583
Not that that's bad,
of course. Just boring.

439
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,875
[DIETRICH]
No kidding.

440
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,208
I thought I would doze off
near the end, there.

441
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,083
The second company prides
itself on blitz attacks,

442
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
not slow advances.

443
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,458
[DIETRICH]
Is that... a Levitate ship?

444
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,875
[ADELTRUD]
A little late.

445
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,625
[ARCHID]
And it's alone.

446
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,000
[gasps] That's no ship.
Look closer!

447
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,833
Everyone, run for cover!

448
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,208
[BOTH yelp]

449
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,666
[ERNESTI] A giant weapon
modeled after the ancient

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,583
drake demon beast.

451
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,958
I'm surprised
Zaloudek would make

452
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,583
something so unorthodox.

453
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,250
[DOLOTEO]
I found you, Demon!

454
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,750
The Vyver will put you down,
once and for all.

455
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,375
Prince Cristobal will
finally be avenged!

456
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,166
[KOJASS] I had planned
to construct the Vyver

457
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,500
some time ago, but ultimately
shelved the project.

458
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,666
Your use of explosions
as propellant

459
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
made my drake possible.

460
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,750
Thanks for giving me
the key to your demise.

461

[ERNESTI]
I see.

462
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,708
I guess if I can learn
about your technology,

463
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,250
there's no reason
you shouldn't be able

464
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,416
to adapt to mine.

Well played, Lord Kojass.

You Fremmevians have such
difficult names to pronounce.

Well, it doesn't matter.
