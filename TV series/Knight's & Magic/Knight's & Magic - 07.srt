00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,416
[SELESTINA] The mock battle with
the Lab in the Capital City

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,916
of Kankunen is almost underway.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,333
With Ernesti leading the charge,
the Order of the Silver Phoenix

4
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,666
brought their new mech,
the Tzendolg,

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,625
and three Silhouette Knights
equipped with Option Works.

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,083
We're here, majesty.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:31,166
As requested. The Order
of the Silver Phoenix!

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,458
Aah! Who does this
little brat think he is?

9
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,333
A horse and rider.
Interesting design.

10
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,250
This might actually
be challenging.

11
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,041
It explains why the
Ambassador recruited us.

12
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,083
I thought fighting a bunch of
kids would be boring as hell,

13
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,458
but this might be fun.

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,291
[AMBROSIUS] I'm sure you're
wondering who that young man is.

15
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,750
He is Commander of the
Order of the Silver Phoenix,

16
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,041
and the brains
behind these new units.

17
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,041
May I present the
renowned Ernesti Echevalier.

18
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,958
The child?
Surely that can't be him.

19
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,041
<i>He</i> developed the newest
Silhouette Knight in a century?

20
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,958
The boy must be
a bonified genius!

21
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,958
[MAN 7D]
He looks barely out of diapers.

22
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,916
That's quite enough--
These valiant warriors

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,666
didn't travel all this way to
hear the prattling of old men.

24
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,666
Warriors. Prepare for combat!

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,750
[OLVER chuckles]

26
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,791
[OLVER] I think his majesty
wants to see the fight

27
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,541
more than anybody.

28
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,875
[SELESTINA]
Despite the uneven numbers,

29
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,416
the match was deemed
fair due to

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,708
the Silver Phoenix's
unique designs.

31
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,041
Ernesti's four units
would be pitted against

32
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,375
all six of
the Kaldatoah Darschs.

33
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,708
Strategy would decide
the victor.

34
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,166
So, like in standard practice,
one mounted rider

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,666
is worth the same
as three infantry units.

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,000
But that's for humans,
not mechs.

37
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,208
And they're all using
enhanced Telestales to boot.

38
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,416
We'll have a major disadvantage.

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,791
I can't wait to see what
the Laboratory engineers did

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,625
with the Telestale's design!

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,875
Oooo! Let's ask them
for a ride later!

42
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,250
Mm-hmm. I shouldn't be surprised

43
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,500
this doesn't faze you,
and yet...

44
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,583
So, uh. How do you
want us to fight these guys?

45
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,916
Should we take three
of them at the same time?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,083
Yeah, about that.
I think I have an idea.

Yes. We can take advantage

00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,958
of the Tzendolg's speed.
It's the only way.

Of course, they'll split

When they do, I'll strike.

trick that little brat used,

[thud]

160
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,375
That's enough!
I've seen what I need.

161
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,916
The new units are exemplary.
That was a splendid battle!

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,250
Knight Runners,
I salute you all!

163
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:17,958
[clapping]

164
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,750
[EMRYS]
The boy. What's his name?

165
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,708
I think... it's Ernesti
Echevalier, your highness.

166
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,916
Hm. What an interesting kid.

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,666
If you hadn't drained
your mana, I'd be through.

168
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,458
We should use the same mech
so it's an even fight next time.

169
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,833
No. I didn't lose
because of the machine.

170
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,833
I just lack experience.

171
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,250
Humility's a virtue,
but there's nothing wrong

172
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,750
with taking a compliment
from a fellow Knight Runner.

173
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,791
Uh! Thank you very much!

174
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,083
Darn it. Not one kill.

175
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,083
I took out two, so I'm happy.

176
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,458
Yeah, same here.

177
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,708
Yeah! I saw! Good work!

178
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,083
[ADELTRUD giggles]

[GEIST]
Ernesti Echevalier!

00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,541
[ALL]
Hm?

00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,541
[GEIST panting]

182
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,750
Aah!

183
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,000
Who's that?

184
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,333
Dunno. Looks like
a Laboratory Knightsmith.

185
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,791
How does that knight-and-rider
model even function?

186
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,625
How do all four legs
work in unison

187
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,666
despite the unit's large frame?

188
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,541
What kind of secret are
you hiding? Answer me!

189
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,875
[ARCHID]
Huh?

190
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,208
[gasps]

191
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,791
Excellent question!
It's quite simple, actually.

192
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,375
I added a second
Ether Reactor to compensate!

193
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,541
Yes! Two reactors would
explain it! Quite clever!

194
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,166
But how did you make
the blue one attain

195
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,791
such incredible speed
and maneuverability?

196
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,208
And the white one!
What was that metallic wire

197
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,750
it shot from its wrist?

198
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,708
I call them
Magius Jet Thrusters!

199
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,250
That's how the Toybox is
capable of such high speeds!

200
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,541
And as for the Lightning Flail,
if you like, I can send

201
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,458
the Silhouette Gear
that was the basic model

202
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,083
to the Lab so you
can play with it!

203
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,291
Ooo! I'd appreciate it!

204
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,875
No, Ernie.

205
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,375
There's no stopping him.
He's on a roll.

206
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,583
Should've known Ernie wasn't
the only mech enthusiast around.

207
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,833
Maybe this is what he'll look
like in the next 80 years.

208
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,500
[OLVER]
It looks like things turned out

209
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,125
just as your majesty had hoped.

210
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,416
[AMBROSIUS] No one
can deny Ernesti's designs

211
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,625
are revolutionary, but they
are far too unpolished.

212
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,291
Unless it is refined,
even the greatest ore

213
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,583
cannot show its true value.

214
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,291
So Ernie is your ore,

215
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,833
and you want the Lab
to do the polishing.

216
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,208
To refine their prototypes.
Make them practical?

217
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,083
I'm counting on you, Olver.

218
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,458
Someday, perhaps soon, we'll be
taking him to the village.

219
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,291
I'll be sure to let them know.

220
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,666
After all, that's why
you keep me around.

221
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,041
That was fun, Chief Geist!

222
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,833
I'll come to your lab someday
so we can talk more!

223
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,958
[GEIST laughing]
Young brats.

224
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,583
Don't count me out.
I still won't let you beat me!

225
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,125
To think there was still
this kind of passion within me.

226
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,625
I thought the fire
had burned out long ago.

227
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,833
[SELESTINA]
Things didn't slow down

228
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,541
after the mock battle had ended.

229
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,750
Two months passed and
the Lab finished polishing

230
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,416
the Kaldatoah Darschs,

231
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,625
giving birth to the Kaletole,
the new mass-production model.

232
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,291
Meanwhile, the Silver Phoenix
developed the Tzendolimble,

233
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,625
a one person version
of the Tzendolg.

234
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,583
Further enhancing
the mech's fighting power.

235
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,750
...then jerk it back
real hard! It's easy!

236
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,333
Sorry, can we take a break?

237
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,750

[door creaks]

239
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,458
[EMRYS] Hey, sorry, old timers.
Didn't mean to keep you waitin'.

240
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,833
I was training the Knights

241
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,750
and things got
a little passionate.

242
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,916
Think a couple of them
might have soiled their armor.

243
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,500
Were they slackin' off
while I was away

244
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,250
or am I just that good?
[chuckles]

245
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,500
Woo! That Kaletole, though!
A hell of a toy.

246
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,833
Any chance I could
get one those just for me?

247
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:11,041
Emrys! Sit down
and shut up, boy.

248
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,791
[LEOTAMUS] I hope they
taught you more than how to

249
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,958
run your mouth in Kuschpercha.

250
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,625
Otherwise, Martina and I will
have a little talk of our own.

251
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,750
Enough. I called you here
for a reason. Let's get to it.

252
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,750
I've been king
of our fair country

253
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,041
for nearly four decades.

254
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,833
I don't know about you,
but that's long enough for me.

255
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm leaving the throne to
Leotamus, effective immediately.

256
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,125
Grandpa.

257
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,125
[SELESTINA]
In the Western Year of 1280.

258
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:46,125
Ambrosius, the Lion King,
gave up his long rule

259
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,916
and bequeathed the throne
of Fremmevilla

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,291
to his son, Leotamus.

261
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,125
In the same year,
at Laihiala Academy...

262
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,708
[ERNESTI]
I can't believe we've graduated.

263
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,125
It barely feels like
any time has passed.

264
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,250
I'm just surprised they
didn't kick all of us out!

265
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,541
[BATSON] Yeah, all we did was
cause trouble and skip classes.

266
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,833
[ADELTRUD] They're probably
glad to finally be rid of us.

267
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,458
Thanks, Laihiala Academy.

268
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,958
We'll always be in your debt.

269
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,541
[SELESTINA]
After their graduation,

270
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,916
Ernesti and the Order
of the Silver Phoenix

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,416
were relocated to the newly
constructed Fort Orobesius

272
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,791
to continue
their Knightly mission.

273
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,208
[SELESTINA]
But soon afterwards...

274
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,708
Uh? A summon from the capital?

275
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
[EMRYS]
Great! You made it!

276
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,333
Guess good things really do
come in small packages.

277
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,833
I suppose they do.

278
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,333
I didn't expect you
to be here. It's an honor.

279
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,500
I heard you were
studying in Kuschpercha.

280
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,458
Is there a reason you're
back in Fremmevilla so soon?

281
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,041
My old man's warming
the throne now.

282
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,416
Seemed like a good reason
to come back home.

283
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Please, time is wasting.
I know you're busy, Ernesti.

284
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,833
But I need a custom
Silhouette Knight made,

285
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,416
and I'd like you
to design it for me.

286
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,416
[ERNESTI]
I'd be happy to, your grace.

287
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,958
But I thought you already
had the Reidis ol Vila.

288
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,875
It's an amazing unit
in it's own right?

289
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,541
Why would you need a new one?

290
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,666
[AMBROSIUS] That is the king's
Silhouette Knight.

291
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,875
He became Leotamus's the moment
he ascended to the throne.

292
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,541
I may be retired,
but with no Silhouette Knight

293
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,625
I can't entertain myself.

294
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,791
And after your remarkable
accomplishments,

295
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,166
I know there is no one
better suited to the task.

296
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,041
N'at case. Make one for me
while you're at it!

297
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,375
--[ERNESTI] Uh?
--[AMBROSIUS] Mmm.

298
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,958
Would it be possible
for you to make two of them?

299
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,291
It won't be a problem.

300
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,125
So, what kind of mechs
would you like them to be?

301
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,666
That's easy.

302
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,416
Everyone knows the most
important trait is power.

303
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,458
[ERNESTI]
Right.

304
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,000
--Then, power.
--[ERNESTI] Okay.

305
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,833
--Followed by power!
--[ERNESTI] I see.

306
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,750
[ADELTRUD]
He's a muscle-head.

307
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,166
Any preference on how it looks?
The sky is the limit!

308
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,625
[EMRYS]
Super-strong, uh, like a lion!

309
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,041
People should think of
Gramps when they see it!

310
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,041
Will that work
for you, your grace?

311
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,916
It should do nicely.

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,875
As long as it's not too
unbalanced, do what you like.

313
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,833
[ERNESTI]
Understood!

314
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,083
I promise these new units
won't disappoint.

315
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,375
They will be worthy
of your nobility.

316
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,625
[ADELTRUD]
He's got that look again.

317
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
[SELESTINA]
Ernesti returned to Orobesius

318
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,208
filled with excitement,
and immediately began to work

319
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,041
on the royal Silhouette Knights
for Ambrosius and Emrys.

320
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,583
The seasons passed
in the blink of an eye.

321
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,208
The units were completed
and brought to Kankunen.

322
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,958
Oh, wow.

323
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,916
[ERNESTI] I'm proud to present
the Goldleo and Jilbatiga!

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,375
As requested, the units
are incredibly powerful

325
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,166
both in offensive
and defensive capabilities.

326
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,083
They should serve you well
and keep you safe.

327
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,416
Both of you are
important to Fremmevilla.

328
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,208
So, only the best will do.

329
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,166
[laughs] They're even better
than I was hoping!

330
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,541
[AMBROSIUS] Hmm. A golden lion
and a silver tiger.

331
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,041
I see. Well, then.

332
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,500
In that case...

333
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,125
[AMBROSIUS, EMRYS]
I'll take... this one!

334
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,500
[BOTH]
Uh...

335
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,416
Come on. You can't handle
a flashy one like this.

336
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,125
You're not exactly
the vision of youth anymore.

337
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:13,666
I'm aware. I'm equally aware
of your inexperience, boy.

338
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,083
A cub has to earn the right
to be called a lion,

339
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,833
and you haven't done that yet.

340
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:21,375
That so? Well, there's
no time like the present.

341
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,583
I'll show you everything
I learned in Kushcpercha.

342
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,541
[AMBROSIUS] You intend to
take it with a show of force?

343
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,166
Very well, boy.
I'll put you in your place.

344
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,916
I'm so confused.

345
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,916
They're both muscle-heads.

346
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,208
Shouldn't you be
takin' a nap, old timer?

347
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,000
Better show me
some respect, lad.

348
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,375
You're not too old
for me to spank you!

349
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,250
Part of me wants to stop them,
but I'm kind of afraid to.

350
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,583
[ADELTRUD]
Mm-hmm.

351
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,208
[EMRYS]
Have at you!

352
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,166
[EMRYS grunts]

353
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,666
[AMBROSIUS chuckles]

354
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,083
[EMRYS grunts]

355
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,000
[ERNESTI] I had no idea he was
so proficient with a spear!

356
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,125
If this is how he is
when he's 60,

357
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,083
I can't imagine what
he was like in his prime.

358
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,250
Honestly, with a name
like "the Lion,"

359
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,250
I think it's pretty clear
what he was like.

360
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,916
[STEPHANIA] I heard the
former king looked just like

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,458
Prince Emrys when
he was in his prime.

362
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,291
I've heard he was quite the
force to be reckoned with.

363
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,375
His presence on the
battlefield was always welcome.

364
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,541
He would lead the charge himself

365
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,458
cutting a path of
destruction with his spear.

366
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,791
Once, when our unit
was surrounded,

367
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,875
and it appeared as if
our deaths were certain...

368
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,416
[KNUT] My prince,
I'll open the way through!

369
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,708
At least you will make it out!

370
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,458
[AMBROSIUS laughs]
Don't be foolish!

371
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,791
[gasps]

372
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,458
Everywhere you look
there are enemies!

373
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,458
This is the kind of battle
a Knight Runner dreams of!

374
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,708
[laughing]

375
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,041
Not only did he break through
those demon beasts,

376
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,041
he managed to save us
in the process.

377
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,041
Even those mindless beasts
feared him after that.

378
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,875
They say that a man's
position changes him.

379
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,416
And in his case,
it was for the better.

380
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,708
It must have been
difficult for you.

381
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,583
If that hadn't been
a training weapon,

382
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,750
I'd be eatin' dirt
right about now.

383
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:29,125
That's my gramps for ya.
S'like charging a brick wall.

384
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,708
[panting]

385
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,500
[chuckles]

386
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,375
Well, I'm not gonna
win this by thinking.

387
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,791
My victory lies here
within my blade!

388
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,541
Such impatience.
You left your feet wide open!

389
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,208
[gasps]

390
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,083
--[EMRYS] You're mine!
--Think again!

391
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,458
[EMRYS]
What?

392
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,208
He used the explosion
from the back weapon

393
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,333
to keep from slamming
into the ground.

394
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,541
Way to use your head, Emrys!

395
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,208
[yells]

396
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
Spirit conquers all!

397
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,541
It appears your time
in Kuschpercha

398
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,958
wasn't wasted after all, my boy.

399
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,541
Did you hold back on me?

400
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,291
[AMBROSIUS]
Don't be stupid.

401
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,458
My claws just aren't
as sharp as they used to be.

402
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,750
The golden lion is yours.
Take it!

403
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,625
Considering what I went
through to get this bad boy,

404
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,916
I'll make sure
not to embarrass myself!

405
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Wow, he's fired up, isn't he?

406
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
--Tell me, Ernesti.
--Sire?

407
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,833
Despite the difference
in appearances,

408
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:06,041
the Jilbatiga and Goldleo
are on equal footing, yes?

409
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,458
Yes, sir! In every way.

410
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,875
It didn't make sense to build
one stronger than the other.

411
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,458
Very good.

412
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,208
[EMRYS] I'll make
you proud, Gramps! Ha-ha!

413
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,125
[ERNESTI] Hold on.
This was his plan all along!

414
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,458
Whether he won or lost,

415
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,916
the prince would
still be better off!

416
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,916
[QUITTERIE]
One who would disrupt

417
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,916
the journey has appeared.

418
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,125
A whispering evil
lies upon the forest.

419
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,833
[MESSENGER 7A]
Understood.

420
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,083
I shall send
a rider immediately.

421
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,333
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "Secret &amp; Quest"!

422
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,833
The world's mysteries call me!
