1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,000
[KOJASS] This should prove
quite interesting.

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,041
Vyver versus Demon.
Large versus small.

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,416
I wonder whose technology
will come out on top.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,208
Only one way to find
out, "Lord" Kojass.

5
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,500
The time for talk is over.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,541
Ikaruga and I are ready.
Let's end this!

7
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,333
[KOJASS] So nice of you to
join us, Mr. Echevalier!

8
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,541
[ERNESTI] I swear,
on the soul of my Ikaruga,

9
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,875
I will never let
that future come true!

10
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,416
[ARCHID]
I'm not gonna.

11
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,166
All right, we built this
ship for ramming things!


12
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,583
Time to test it out!

13
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,750
'Kay, but don't blame
me if it ends badly!

14
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,625
[DOLOTEO]
So, the demon intends to ram us.

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,666
Well, we won't give
him the satisfaction!

16
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,916
Ankyurosa! Shoot him down!

[ALL yelp]

Calm down! Port-side
jet thrusters, full power!

19
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,458
Run away!

20

[BATSON yelps]

21
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,041
Okay. That was unexpected.

22
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,708
Chase those cowards!

23
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,500
They fell for it!

24
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,833
All according to plan!

25
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,375
[SOLDIERS gasp]

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,833
We're counting on
you, Silver Phoenix.

27
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,500
Now that we're here, we can
fight as hard as we want!

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,458
[ERNESTI] Time to launch
the counterattack!

29
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,750
Bespiari. Awaken!

30
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,500
Those won't hit no many
how many you fire.

with some sort of liquid.

Figure out what it is!

Ah! It's oil!

--That damn demon tricked us!
--Quite clever!

Did you like them?

39
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,125
I got the idea from those
annoying smoke bombs of yours!

40
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,208
You've turned those poor robots
into glorified turrets.

41
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,375
I'll set them free,
one way or another!

42
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,708
[SOLDIER 12B]
Get those fires out!

43
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,375
[SOLDIER 12A]
We've lost five Ankyurosas!

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,791
Make that six!

45
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,583
Not yet. Not until
that bastard is dead.

46
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,458
We still have the Blood Grail.

47
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,708
Now might be your
last chance to use it.

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,708
You just have to give the order,

49
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,958
and you'll have the power
to crush the demon!

50
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,375
I like to call it,
"The Maximizer."

The drawbridges are coming down!

[DIETRICH]
Okay.

00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,208
I saw one of the
drawbridges come down.

56

Nicely done.
I'm impressed, Commander.

57

Back at you.
You're something else.

58

They really have us
backed into a corner.

My, my.

62
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,750
I guess there's only one way
to fight back now, General.

Fine, we'll use
this "Maximizer."

Uh, roger!

a little too big for your body,

Now that we've maximized,

they could throw everything
they have at us

Bring your whole army,

same way I did Twin Swords!

Eleonora? Are you okay?

121
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,375
Just look.

122
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,208
Our friends are giving
everything for our country.

123
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,083
And yet all I can do is
watch them risk their lives.

124
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,875
But that is my duty.

125
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,500
Damn it! Why won't
you just die?!

126
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,791
[ERNESTI]
That thing is a monster.

127
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,291
That said, even the best
man-made inventions

128
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,875
can't magically grow.

129
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,500
So, it's wearing the
excess mana like a cloak

130
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,541
that nullifies
long-range attacks.

131
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,500
If they think my only strength
is fighting from a distance,

132
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,583
they've got another
thing coming.

133
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll just focus my mana into my
Sword Cannons and break through.

134
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:18,416
And then, engage the drake
at point-blank range!

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,291
[DOLOTEO]
Here he comes.

136
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,833
Like a moth to the flame.

137
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,333
Incinerate the demon until
there's nothing left but ash!

138
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,208
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

C'mon, stop being
so predictable.

142
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:51,291
[KOJASS] Well, so nice of you
to join us, Mr. Echevalier!

143
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,875
Every weapons designer
wants more power,

144
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,083
but your designs achieve
power by going bigger,

145
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,166
which sacrifices any aesthetics.

146
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,458
Aesthetics are for
sculptures, not weapons!

147
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,291
All they need to do is
function as we intended!

148
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
You couldn't be
more wrong, Kojass!

149
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,916
These Knights are
sculptures! Works of art!

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,083
What a shame. A crying shame!

151
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,541
All that technology...

152
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,541
All that power...

153
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
...should be in an airship!

154
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,541
No, a Silhouette Knight!

155
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,833
[KOJASS, ERNEST] Why can't you
see my design is superior?!

156
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,958
Burn in hell!

157
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,875
We missed?

158
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,250
A flying Silhouette Knight
is just a child's plaything!

159
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,583
My Vyver is the future
of weapon's development!

160
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,458
Your toy and others like it
will be helpless before it!

161
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,541
I swear on the
soul of my Ikaruga,

162
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,916
I will never let that
future come true!

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,583
[GUSTAV]
You shall not pass!

164
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,458
As long as I have
swords to swing,

165
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,458
I will keep you
from this fortress!

166
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,375
Look at the other
bridge, you fool!

167
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,416
The battle's already over!

168
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,666
I don't care!

169
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,041
Even if I'm the
last one standing,

170
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,750
I'll slice your entire
army to pieces!

171
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,791
Wake up, Deadman!

172
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,916
[GUSTAV]
Slice and dice!

173
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
I'll give you credit,
white shields.

174
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,708
You're even more annoying
than your crimson friend!

175
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,916
It can't end here!
Not when we're so close!

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,375
Come on, partner, hold
together a little more!

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,583
[gasps]

178
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,291
[EDGAR]
This battle is ours.

179
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,250
Now that I've caught you.

180
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,791
Are you crazy?!

181
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,041
And this time a smoke bomb
won't save your sorry ass.

182
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,208
What the--?

183
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,625
This'll be a bumpy ride, Edgar!

184
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:47,333
Ahh! Howling... Blast!

185
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,583
This isn't over!

186
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,916
[SOLDIERS cheering]

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,166
[EDGAR]
Well done, Aldirat.

188
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,333
You can finally rest.

189
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,916
Thank you.

190
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,750
Disappear into the darkness
of history, Vyver,

191
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,875
and forever be
known as a failure!

192
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,083
[SOLDIER 12A] External
equipment damage exceeds 80%!

193
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,833
[SOLDIER 13A] High-density
ether supply is unstable!

194
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,291
[SOLDIER 12A] Sector eight's
gone completely silent!

195
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,375
Insane. It's just one
Silhouette Knight, dammit!

196
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,750
[KOJASS] Hmm. In terms of
the physical end product,

197
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,333
if not the design itself,
I suppose I can give credit

198
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,916
where it's due.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,666
But don't think for a moment I'm
out of the game, young Ernesti.

200
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,208
What the hell just happened?

201
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,541
It shrank?

202
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,125
Take my life if
that's what you want.

203
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,125
But you... you will
never have the victory.

204
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,125
[grunts]

205
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,708
--Now what?
--No!

206
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,208
He wouldn't!

207
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,041
[BOTH gasp]

208
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,041
As long as I can kill
that sniveling brat,

209
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,125
the reborn Kuschpercha
won't live to see the dawn.

210
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,250
Queen Eleonora!

211
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,625
If I still had the mana,

212
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,041
I would just burn the Queen
and be done with it.

213
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,166
I'll just use the Vyver
itself as my weapon!

214
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,416
[SOLDIER 13F]
Your highness! Please go!

215
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,875
Eleonora! We should run!

216
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,125
I can't do that.

217
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,375
A Queen must never flee,
no matter how dire

218
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,958
the situation may be.

219
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,916
[ELEONORA] My Knight. I believe
that you'll protect me.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,833
Not good! He's heading
for the camp!

221
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,000
Eleonora!

222
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,666
I won't let you!

223
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,666
Demon! Don't get in my way!

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,125
The Behemoth's Heart and Queen's
Coronet aren't just for show!

225
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,250
I'll give you a demonstration!

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,041
[DOLOTEO]
He's still stronger?

227
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,875
[DOLOTEO yells]

228
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,208
[BOTH scream]

229
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,250
Damn it all!
The camp's in danger!

230
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,750
But if I let go of it now,
no one could stop the drake

231
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,125
from crashing into them!

232
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,791
[ADELTRUD]
Queen Eleonora!

233
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,708
Ah! There must be
something I can do!

234
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,583
No way. That's too crazy,
don't even think it.

235
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,166
[sighs]

236
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,166
[ARCHID] Boss! Can you get
the ship any closer?

237
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,291
What're you gonna do?

238
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,666
What else?
Punch him till he stops!

239
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,500
[BATSON, DAVID]
You're gonna what?

240
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,541
The hell? Does that
idiot have a death wish?

241
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,208
Don't die on us, kid!

242
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,791
I'm not gonna!

[yells]

244
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,333
Sorry, Gustav.
It's up to you now.

245
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,583
Avenge me for the
glory of Zaloudek!

246
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
[SOLDIER 13F]
What's happening?

247
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,166
It's turning away!

248
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,750
[ARCHID] Think I might have
shown off a little too much.

249
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:34,791
Oh, well. As long as the Queen
is safe, I'm okay with this.

250
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,500
[ERNESTI]
Kid!

251
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,791
[ARCHID]
Uh?

252
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,041
Leave the Tzendolimble!
I gotcha!

253
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,000
What took you so long?

254
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,791
You kept me safe through
everything, Tzen.

255
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,208
Thanks a lot.

256
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,833
[SOLDIER 13I]
The Vyver fell!

257
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,000
[SOLDIER 13J]
The Bronze Wing is down, too.

258
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,916
At this point, our
victory is inevitable!

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,708
Advance and take back what's
rightfully Kuschpercha's!

260
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,791
First Shilda Neryaku,
then the capital!

261
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,000
[SOLDIERS yell]

262
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,583
[SELESTINA] The defeat of the
drake battleship resulted

263
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,333
in the complete loss of
Zaloudek's air superiority.

264
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,833
Their army collapsed in the
face of Kuschpercha's assault,

265
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,625
and Shilda Neryaku fell.

266
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,833
The capital, Delvancul,
had used all of its forces

267
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,125
to defend Shilda Neryaku,
and was unable to offer

268
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:40,250
any resistance as the Reborn
Kingdom's forces moved in.

269
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,750
[SELESTINA]
And thus, the ambitions

270
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,541
of the Kingdom of
Zaloudek collapsed.

271
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,125
[SELESTINA] The spring
of Western Year 1283.

272
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,083
The coronation held at
Delvancul served as a message

273
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,541
to the surrounding kingdoms:
Kuschpercha had returned.

274
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,916
And it was stronger
than ever before.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
At that moment,
Eleonora became

276
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,125
both the de facto and dey
jury Queen of Kuschpercha.

277
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,583

Quit slackin' off!

278

Get that stuff loaded...
or you'll be tastin' my boot!

00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,833
[DAVID]
You morons did a great job

281
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,458
tearin' these things to pieces.

282
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,458
Sorry about that, Boss.

283
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,208
If it helps, we know
they'll be better

284
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,708
than ever once you're done.

285
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,333
Heh. Stop it,
you're makin' me blush.

286
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,625
You're gonna be real busy
when we get back home.

287
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,708
That sucks.

288
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
I won't be the only one.

289
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,541
I'm sorry, Ernie.

290
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,958
Build and scrap is the
way of the world, Kid.

291
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,291
As long as you're
safe, I'm fine.

292
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,541
Besides, I have this.

293
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,833
There's so much
to learn from it!

294

[ERNESTI giggles]

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,916
Your Majesty!

00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,208
[ARCHID]
Uh?

298
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,416
Isadola, you think it's
safe for her out here?

299
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,583
[ELEONORA]
Please.

300
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,958
I don't think I could
be anywhere safer.

301
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,500
[ADELTRUD chuckles]

302
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,625
Are you well?

303
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,375
I guess.

304
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,625
You'll be leaving
soon, won't you?

305
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,000
Uh. Yeah.

306
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,125
Though, it feels weird to go
home in a Levitate Ship.

307
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,416
I'm still tryin'
to get over that.

308
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,583
My noble Knight.

309
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,333
I'll never forget how
you protected me.

310
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,458
Or the amazing things
you've done for Kuschpercha.

311
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,750
I don't know.

312
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,958
Doesn't feel like I
did anything special.

313
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,250
You have!

314
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,833
Once things calm down here,

315
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,041
be sure to visit us
in Fremmevilla, 'kay?

316
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,125
[ELEONORA]

Well, see ya.

Ugh! You massive
idiot! Don't say bye!

If Kid was a Silhouette Knight.

I'd be rewriting
his programming.

Uh, I don't think you have
room to talk, Ernie.

That settles it.

[ELEONORA]
Sorry.

Let me stay like this
for just a moment.

327
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,750
After that, I'll go
back to being Queen.

328
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,250
Good luck to you,
my noble Knight.

Wasn't there something else

332
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,375
you could've said to her?

333
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,750
Nah. That was plenty.

Just seven more mountains, boys!

We'll keep pushing until
we get back to Zaloudek.

00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,916
Or until we run out of food.

[KOJASS] Hm? Variable
Magius Jet Thrusters, huh?

How far do you think

342
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,750
your devotion to aesthetics
will take you?

343
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,708
Honestly, I can't wait
to find out for myself.

344
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,833
Of course, you'll learn
more about my theories, too.

345
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:48,333
Perhaps even sooner than you
were expecting, my young rival.

346
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,416
Now then, to find
another king with

to buy my inventions.

Let's go inside.
It's freezing out here.

Welcome home, Silver Phoenix.

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Your work out there
has been exemplary.

355
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,833
Especially you, Knight Runners.

356
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
Your bravery will be
a shining example

357
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,291
to all who come after you.

358
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,083
Your prowess in battle
shall be remembered by all

359
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,333
for generations to come.

360
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,333
And of course,
there's our industrious

Knightsmiths who
toiled ceaselessly

362
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
to keep our Knight
Runners in the fight.

363
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,875
Without your endurance.

364
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,125
Zaloudek may very
well have succeeded

365

in their grim endeavor.

366
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,208
And thank you, Knight Commander,

367
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,166
for giving my worthless
grandson some glory.

368
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,875
I will reward you with
anything you desire.

Nothing is off limits
this time around.

Ask and it shall be yours.

Heh! Not bad at all, Silver.

[BATSON]
Our own Silhouette Knight lab.

375
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,500
I guess it's all right.

376
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,375
But you could've
asked him for more.

377
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,166
You're not as greedy
as I thought, Ernie.

378
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,666
What are you talking about?

379
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,583
Of course I'm greedy!
I'm the king of greedy!

380
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,166
All I wanna do is
collect the most amazing

381
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,125
Knight Runner technology
ever produced,

382
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,291
the greatest Knightsmiths
in the world,

383
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,166
and the ultimate
Silhouette Knights!

384
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,083
I can't think of a more
fulfilling life to lead!

385
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,250
First off, I wanna
make a Silhouette Knight

386
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,125
that flies more beautifully
and efficiently

387
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,750
than Ikaruga ever could.

388
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,041
But to do that,

389
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,166
I'll have to do a redesign
of the fundamentals.

390
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,791
Starting with Ether Reactors
and Crystal Tissue!

391
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,250
I may even need to write
a whole new set of scripts!

392
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,458
Something to compliment the ones
for fluid and heat mechanics.

393
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,708
And not just for
Silhouette Knights, either!

394
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,208
I wanna design
a Silhouette Gear

395
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,208
than can fly as well!
The skies themselves--no,

396
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,000
the way people live would
be totally changed forever!

397
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,500
But surely something
like that is impossible.

398
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,000
The impossible is what we do!

which began as an offensive
by the Kingdom of Zaloudek,

brought Levitate Ship technology
to all nations of the world.

a unique way to move
