Initiate pattern analysis.

161
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,250
Identify basic spells,
physical enhancement,

162
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,625
movement control,
position mapping.

163
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,541
Modularize and link them.

164
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,583
Same for the input
and output control

165
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,875
of the Ether Reactor's power.

166
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,791
[SELESTINA] Ernesti shunned
all methods of physical control

167
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,500
over the Guair. Instead,
he tried to use his Gunlike Rod

168
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,500
to magically input
his own custom scripts.

169
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,958
In the long history
of the Silhouette Knights,

170
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,500
no one had ever
attempted such a feat.

171
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,333
And they would be forever
changed after this.

172
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,791
[ERNESTI] Finally, I'll
convert the spell parameters

173
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,416
of myself and
the Silhouette Knight,

174
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,041
and initiate input-output
control at default values!

175
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,375
Conversion complete.
Activating engine!

176
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,625
Now, a quick adjustment
to the output variable,

177
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,833
feed back the
movement gap, and...

178
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,166
...initiate optimization!

179
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,375
It's working.
It's working! It's working!

00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,958
Aaah!

183

I'm doing it!
I'm really doing it!

184
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm piloting a robot!

185
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,166
I wish we had tried
to stop Ernie.

186
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,833
[STEFANIA] He was gone
before we had the chance to.

[ARCHID]
This might sound crazy,

188
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,500
but I think he stole
a Silhouette Knight

189
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,416
and went to
attack that thing himself.

190
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,625
No way. How would he pilot it?
He's far too small.

00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,083
--It's possible.
--Huh?!

Uh! Whoa! Just look at this!

Almost its entire body is
covered with invincible armor!

218

It's pointless to cut it,
and magic doesn't work, so...

I'll try the first lesson

That barely scratched it!

Does that mean its shell
goes all the way through?

223
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,500
[SELESTINA]
In Ernie's new world,

224
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,750
a demon beast is a creature
that can use magic

225
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,083
through the catalyst crystals
infused within their bodies.

226
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,125
The most powerful magic
a behemoth possessed

227
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:37,166
was the enhancement magic that
supported its massive frame.

228
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,375
I see. Guess I'll have
to wear the big guy down.

So, sit back down and shut up!

236

[ERNESTI] No point in holding
onto this. Now what?

Of course,
we're down to 20% mana.

Sadly, there's still a limit.

But I won't retreat
without leaving my mark.

The lightning traveled through

the behemoth's eye,
burning everything along its

it struck the brain stem.

Despite its powerful magic,

310
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,791

the enhancement magic

If you can move, get to work

318
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,083
recovering the beast's heart!

319
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,458
[EDGAR]
I'm so sorry, Dietrich.

320
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,666
I thought you had
abandoned us, but I was wrong.

321
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,625
I won't forget
what you did, my friend.

322
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,666
--[EDGAR] Ugh!
--[PHILLIP gasps]

323
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,666
I thought we were dead for sure!

324
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,083
Hm? Oh, hey, Edgar!

325
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,333
What's with the face?

326
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,416
[ADELTRUD laughs]
I told you, Big Sis!

327
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,791
Ernie stole a Knight and
saved us, all by himself!

328
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,250
[sighs]
Poor Dietrich.

329
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,666
I don't think he'll
ever live this one down.

330
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,416
Hey, Ernie.

331
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,083
What if you couldn't get
inside the Silhouette Knight?

332
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,916
What was the plan then?

333
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,916
Probably to catch up with
the carriage and evacuate.

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,375
It was all a big gamble,
but I couldn't let

335
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,625
the opportunity slip by me.

336
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, at least he's
willing to admit as much.

337
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,750
And now, I know
I'm too small to pilot.

338
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,791
So, building a mech of my own
is the only option left to me.

339
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,875
[ALL gasp]

340
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,208
I thought you were done!

341
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,666
I'm just getting started!

342
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,083
You'll see, Addy. One day soon,

343
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,958
I'll pilot a Silhouette Knight
made with my own hands!

344
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,666
[AMBROSIUS]
He's 12?!

345
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,541
You're saying a
prepubescent child

346
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,166
defeated a
division-class demon beast?

347
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,583
[PHILLIP] Yes, sire!
Announcing this would affect

348
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,333
the Knight's morale, so we're
keeping it quiet for now.

349
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:40,875
[AMBROSIUS] Ernesti Echevalier.
Lauri's grandson, perhaps?

350
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,041
I believe so, sire.

351
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:51,333
[AMBROSIUS] Even the most loyal
dogs can turn on their masters.

352
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,958
He could be dangerous to us.

353
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,916
I suppose I'll have to
meet this child and find out.

354
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,208
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "Scrap &amp; Build"!

355
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,375
I can see my new mech now!
