00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,458
[ARCHID]
Ernie!

165
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,041
[DOLOTEO]
What? How is he still standing?

166
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,500
General! Our mana
pool is too low!

167
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,166
Another shot like that and
we won't remain airborne!

168
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,583
[gasps]

169
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,416
[DOLOTEO]
That's the withdrawal signal!

170
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,333
But, who?

171
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,416
[GUSTAV] It's time to go,
old man. Pull back!

172
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,541
[growls] Get us out of here!

173
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,708
They're really letting us go?

174
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,666
No. I bet they ran low
on mana and had to retreat.

175
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,333
I'm impressed they
managed to disable

176
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,041
Ikaruga's Jet
Thruster like that.

177
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,500
But that's the last
time it's gonna happen!

178
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,708
They look really
beat up. Don't they?

179
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,541
[SELESTINA] The battle between
Ernesti and the battleship Vyver

180
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,583
ended in a tie.

181
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,083
But the Kuschperchans
were so shaken,

182
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,916
it felt like a defeat.

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
It was the first time

184
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,750
the Order of the Silver Phoenix
had ever experienced failure.

185
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,291
You got too crazy with it.

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,333
The frame is a total mess now.

187
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,666
There's nothing we can do here.

188
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,833
We'll just have to
send it back home.

189
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,625
What will you do?
Switch to another one?

190
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,666
[DOLOTEO]
Horatio Kojass.

191
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,000
Born to a family that
researches ancient techniques.

192
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,083
He fled, betraying
them and taking the

193
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,333
Pure Ether Operation Theory with
him. Hardly sounds trustworthy.

194
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,208
[KOJASS grunting]

195
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,666
Lord Kojass.

196
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,208
[KOJASS]
General.

197
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,958
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have tidied up.

198
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,250
Oh.

199
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,541
Congratulations on a
successful counterattack.

200
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,708
You must be very proud.

201
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,166
"Successful"?

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,458
The Demon is alive, and the
prince remains unavenged.

203
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,041
What exactly are you working on?

204
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,000
[KOJASS]
Just what it looks like.

205
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,458
Something new for the Vyver,

206
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,208
so your next "success"
will feel like one.

207
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
[DOLOTEO] And here I
thought you didn't like

208
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,416
to get your hands dirty.

209
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,625
[KOJASS]
As they say,

210
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,333
"If you want it done right,
do it yourself."

211
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,125
Is this some kind of
massive Ether Reactor?

212
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,500
I didn't think they
could get this big.

213
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,125
[KOJASS] Very observant.
I call it the "Blood Grail."

214
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,458
It's specifically designed
for high-density ether.

215
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,458
Though it's still a prototype.

216
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,208
Thirteen reactors
linked together

217
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,750
couldn't stop that monster,
so I had to do something.

218
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,625
You think this will
be the difference?

219
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,708
Turn this on, and you'll
command a power

220
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,958
that will make the Demon look
like an insignificant flea.

221
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,250
In theory.

222
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,500
[DOLOTEO]
Tch.

223
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,041
[KOJASS] But, even if it
does work as intended,

224
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,416
the power will be
a double-edged sword.

225
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,625
Once it starts to go
out of control,

226
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,250
nobody can stop it.

227
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,458
[gasps]

228
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,458
Again, just in theory.

229
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,541
Does that scare you?
Will you refuse it?

230
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,708
But I went to all the
trouble of putting it in.

231
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,291
I even have blisters.

232
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,500
[DOLOTEO]
Don't worry.

233
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,916
If it'll kill the Demon,
I'll master it.

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,500
[KOJASS] That's what I
wanted to hear, General.

235
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,875
Oh, right.

236
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,541
Equipment this delicate will
need to be monitored so,

237
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,833
I'll be coming along
for the next battle.

238
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,041
Really?

239
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,208
You know how Knights
speak with their swords?

240
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,958
Well, General, Engineers
speak with their creations.

241
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,250
I can't wait.

242
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,708
What kind of conversation
will we have?

243
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
Ernesti Echevalier.

244
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,708
[CATARINA] New supplies
have arrived from home.

245
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,333
Your behavior aside,
it's a loss to my army

246
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,333
not to have a knight of your
caliber on the battlefield.

247
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,708
It's nice to know
I'm appreciated.

248
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,625
But, my Swordman is scap
and I don't have a spare.

249
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,083
Not a problem.

250
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,708
[GUSTAV]
No way!

251
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,541
The royal Silhouette
Knight, the Alkeloryx.

252
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,125
The best unit in all Zaloudek.

253
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,166
Brother Carlitos
sent it from home.

254
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,875
But it won't do any
good without a pilot.

255
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,708
Use it as you see fit.

256
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,708
Really?! Thank you, Majesty!

257
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,791
When I'm done, the Demon
and his friends'll be in

258
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,875
so many pieces, the grim reaper
won't know what to do!

259
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,916
Reports indicate that
the first fortress

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,958
has fallen once again.
The third fortress, as well.

261
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,500
They're pushing too fast.

262
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,458
We can't keep the
ground we took.

263
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
So, this "Drake" unit.

264
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,291
Did it really give you
that much trouble?

265
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,708
Yes.

266
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,458
It's something entirely
different than a Levitate ship

267
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,083
or Silhouette Knight.

268
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,708
We should consider it
a new category of weapon.

269
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,166
Can you defeat it?

270
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,958
Our first battle was a tie,

271
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,166
but they're likely
to improve the design.

272
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,541
I would, and did.

273
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,208
I equipped the
Magius Jet Thruster

274
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,083
with a protective filter
that should mitigate

275
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,791
the effect of their
smoke shells.

276
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,041
They won't clip my wings twice.

277
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,041
But that isn't what you asked,
and to be perfectly honest,

278
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,166
I doubt the Ikaruga could
beat it the way it is now.

279
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,916
You seem oddly calm
about that, Ernie.

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,875
What's Zaloudek's next move?

281
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,375
[ERNESTI]
More of the same.

282
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,708
Their basic tactic will be
an assault from the air,

283
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,333
using the drake
and their airships.

284
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,250
The only ones who can
fight this, I'm afraid,

285
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,708
are my Ikaruga and the
Order of the Silver Phoenix.

286
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,041
All right.

287
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,041
We'll form a unit around
Ikaruga and counterattack.

288
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,083
Hopefully it's enough.

289
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,166
There is a chance the
drake won't show up,

290
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
in which case...

291
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,416
[HELVI] ...we'll have
committed our entire force,

292
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,583
and left the
homeland defenseless.

293
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,583
This war will be over quickly
if our base is destroyed.

294
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,791
Then we'll strengthen
our defenses.

295
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,166
[ADELTRUD]
Won't that just cause the enemy

296
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,458
to throw everything
they have at us?

297
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,708
[DIETRICH]
Yeah, and they just received

298
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,625
fresh supplies and soldiers.

299
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,875
I'd like to avoid a mass battle.

300
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,958
We don't have the
numbers to survive it.

301
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,541
So, is there any way
to strengthen the defenses

302
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
and take out the drake
at the same time?

303
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,375
--[DAVID] You idiot!
--Sorry!

304
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,625
As it stands, we don't
have a way to do that.

305
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,708
The point of the meeting
is solving this problem.

306
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,333
Didn't hafta hit me.

307
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,416
[NOBLE 9B]
Hm.

308
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,083
Damned if we do,
damned if we don't, huh?

309
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:31,708
[ELEONORA]
Not quite.

310
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,875
[GROUP]
Huh?

311
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,041
There is an option
no one has considered.

312
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,250
If the enemy is afraid
of another confrontation

313
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,875
with Ernesti, then...

314
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,750
...we should give them that
by attacking Delvancul head on.

315
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,958
But, Your Highness!

316
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,500
We can't!

317
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,125
You'll be left here without
a single Knight to protect you!

318
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,125
I wouldn't want my top
advisors worried about me.

319
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,208
So I'll go with you.

320
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,416
We'll take our full army

321
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,250
and the Order of the
Silver Phoenix as well.

322
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,750
They won't be expecting it,
that's for sure.

323
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,333
I know I wouldn't!

324
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,833
I'm through with this
constant back and forth.

325
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,708
Enough Knights have died for us.

326
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,791
Enough people have suffered
at the hands of Zaloudek.

327
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,375
For Kuschpercha, we'll take
back our capital, at last.

328
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,458
[laughs]

329
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,708
[ELEONORA]
My brave Knights of Kuschpercha,

330
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,250
these past months
have been fraught

331
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,458
with trials and tribulations
no nation should face.

332
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,500
[ELEONORA] We lost our
beloved capital to a country

333
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,125
of cowardly invaders.

334
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,791
We've lost our loved ones.

335
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,333
And still, we're in danger
of losing even more.

336
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,125
But we will rise again.

337
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,333
Through our own efforts,
and through the power

338
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,083
of our newfound friends.

339
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,666
Instead of letting that
night of tragedies haunt us,

340
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
we will use it as fuel.

341
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,916
We will retake our capital,
and avenge the fallen!

342
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,708
As queen,

343
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,000
I swear Kuschpercha will be
whole and at peace once more!

344
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
But before that peace comes,

345
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,875
we will remove the
invaders from our home,

346
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,208
and make sure they never return!

347
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,125
All forces, to victory!

348
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,583
[SOLDIERS cheer]

349
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,041
[SOLDIERS]
To victory!

350
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,291
Stirring speech! Nicely done.

351
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,666
Do you really think so?

352
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,083
Yes! Being queen suits you well.

353
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,166
You're doing a
great job, Highness.

354
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,625
Don't be so formal.

355
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,458
It's weird having my
family call me "Highness."

356
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,958
You better get used
to it, and quickly.

357
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,000
Things have changed.

358
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,250
We can't go back
to how they were.

359
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,916
[ELEONORA]
Ernesti.

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,541
Yes, Your Highness?
What can I do for you?

361
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,541
As Queen of Kuschpercha,
I feel I must apologize.

362
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,416
You're our guests, and yet
we entrust so much to you.

363
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,791
I regret that
more than anything.

364
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,166
Please, think nothing of it.

365
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,000
I have my reasons for
being in this fight.

366
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,583
Let's just say
our interests align

367
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,125
and leave it at that, all right?

368
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,333
He's right, Elly.

369
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,500
Don't apologize--
you might spoil him.

370
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,666
Next thing you know,

371
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,500
he'll ask for all
your mechs and castles.

372
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,041
Gee, thanks a lot, Highness.

373
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,375
That wasn't very nice!

374
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,625
Yeah, but it's true!

375
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,416
[laughs]

376
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,833
[ALL laugh]

377
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,625
[SELESTINA] The Kuschperchan
army made their move

378
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,500
with haste. The goal of
the operation was to down

379
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,833
the drake battleship and retake
the old capital of Delvancul.

380
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,541
Their momentum fully restored,

381
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,041
they pressed on until reaching
Shilda Neryaku Fortress,

382
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,708
the last obstacle keeping
them from their goal.

383
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,791
There, they encountered
Zaloudek's army.

384
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,125
[HELVI]
The enemy airships are here!

385
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,666
Misshire Javelins. Fire!

386
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,791
You have your orders!

387
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
Defend the queen at all costs!

388
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,500
Don't let a single
enemy get through!

389
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,333
Show them once and for all

390
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,583
why the first company
of the Silver Phoenix

391
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,041
is known as the Shield!

392
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,166
[EMRYS]
Knights! Fight hard!

393
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,208
When those drawbridges come
down, this battle is ours!

394
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,500
Then it's a straight shot
home to Delvancul!

395
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,333
[NORA] I never expected
to go on a mission

396
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,041
with you, Captain Cunitz.
It is an honor.

397
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,833
[DIETRICH] Thanks, but it's
not that big a deal.

398
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,833
I just happen know my way
around a Silhouette Gear.

399
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,458
Our friends are counting on us.

400
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,333
Success here is paramount.

401
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,500
Right.

402
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Let's open the door
for them, shall we?

403
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,833
[LETONMAKI] The resistance
is greater than expected.

404
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,250
Perhaps if we punched
a hole through this line...

405
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,833
[gasps] Majesty! Look up there!

406
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,125
So that's it. The Drake.

407
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,500
Ah.

408
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,583
How kind of the
queen to come to us.

409
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,625
Burn her to cinders in
front of her entire army!

410
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,375
Oh, my! As I live and breathe.

411
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,916
The Demon's here.

412
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,791
And he's gone
through some changes.

413
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,416
Rather odd, that.

414
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,458
I'm not sure what it is.

415
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,916
[KOJASS]
I see now. You plagiarist.

416
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,416
How's my Levitate Ship
working out, I wonder?

417
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,750
[DAVID]
Ya know, for a second there,

418
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,625
I didn't think we'd have
this thing ready in time.

419
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,375
Never underestimate the
ingenuity of a dwarf!

420
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,791
Is it too late to turn around?

421
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,666
I really don't wanna be here.

422
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,208
[ARCHID]
What do you mean, Batson?

423
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,583
This is when we put forth
our best effort!

424
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,500
I'm so excited, I'm shaking.

425
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,500
Let's do this!

426
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,041
[ADELTRUD]
Do what exactly?

427
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,791
We're the glorified
engine for this thing.

428
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,166
We're kinda stuck here.

429
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,500
What's important
is how you feel!

430
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,833
[ERNESTI] When I first saw
airships, I knew a design

431
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,291
like the Drake
wasn't far behind.

432
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,083
Sorry. I can't allow
you to exist.

433
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,916
If I don't defeat you,
this world will trend

434
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,458
toward larger weapons.

435
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,916
With each re-design,
the airships

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,958
will slowly become battleships.

437
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,125
If that happens,
the robots I love

438
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,916
more than anything
will become obsolete

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,791
or completely forgotten.

440
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,833
No way.

441
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,916
Not while I'm alive and kicking.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,458
I'll destroy that outcome
so that robots are the future!

443
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,041
[KOJASS] This should
prove quite interesting.

444
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,125
Vyver versus Demon.
Large versus small.

445
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,041
I wonder whose technology
will come out on top?

446
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,750
Only one way to
find out, Lord Kojass.

447
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,166
The time for talk is over.

448
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,208
Ikaruga and I are ready.
Let's end this!

449
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,791
[ERNESTI] Final episode:
"Heaven and Earth."

450
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,916
The big goodbye is calling me!
