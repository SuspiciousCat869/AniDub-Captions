1
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,791
[LAURI]
Greetings, majesty.

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,250
This is my grandchild,
Ernesti Echevalier.

4
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,291
It's an honor to meet you, sire.

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,875
[AMBROSIUS] The reports said
the child was a boy.

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,666
[ERNESTI] It's true.
I can prove it, if required.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,583
Fearless and straightforward,
despite his appearance.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,916
He is Lauri's.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,416
Thank you for inviting us,
your majesty.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,750
I'm impressed. He's quite
composed for someone his age.

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,166
I wish more children
showed such respect.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,541
I'm honored by
your praise. Majesty.

13
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,375
I'm sure, by now,
you've wondered why

14
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,333
I summoned you here, Ernesti.

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,083
Your victory the other day was
"unexpected" to say the least,

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,958
and presented
quite the conundrum.

17
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,375
I'm unsure how
to reward you for it.

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,958
Thank you. But Ernesti
doesn't require a reward.

19
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,250
He's still a child.

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,541
[AMBROSIUS]
Child or no,

21
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,458
I cannot fail to
compensate someone

22
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,500
who defeats a behemoth
single-handedly.

23
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:14,041
What is it you desire?
Name it and it shall be yours.

24
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,250
Anything?

25
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,791
[ERNESTI] Calm down. He can't be
asking me this out of goodwill.

26
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,000
There's a motive.
I should assume this is

27
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,875
some sort of test on his part.

28
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,000
Should I just say
I don't need anything?

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,875
Or throw caution to the wind?

30
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,666
And if I choose the latter,
what do I ask for?

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,291
The latest model
of Silhouette Knight?

32
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,541
No. No, this is
the chance of a lifetime!

33
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,875
I should ask for something
impossible to obtain.

34
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,458
Something I'll never have
another chance to get!

35
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,500
[ERNESTI] In that case,
I ask for this, sire.

36
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,083
I want knowledge.
Knowledge that can't be found

37
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,583
in any books. Only you
can grant this to me, sire.

38
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,791
I want to know how
to make an Ether Reactor.

39
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,000
The heart of a Knight!

40
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:02,166
--[gasps]
--[KNUT] Uh!

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,791
You ingrate! How dare you
take advantage

42
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,625
of the King's generosity?!

43
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,875
That is one of our country's
greatest treasures!

44
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,458
A secret kept for generat--

45
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,041
Dixgard. That's quite enough.

46
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,208
You are correct,
young Echevalier.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,375
I am the only one who can
grant you such knowledge.

48
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,750
But, I must ask,
what will you do

49
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,250
once you've learned the
mysteries of the Knight's heart?

50
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,916
[ERNESTI]
Okay, this is it!

51
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,541
[ERNESTI] As I'm sure
you're aware, majesty,

52
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,208
I'm currently learning
to be a Knight Runner

53
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,291
at Laihiala Academy,
but my ultimate goal is,

54
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,083
and has always been, to acquire
my own unique Silhouette Knight.

55
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,375
[AMBROSIUS] Aah. Now that's
a wish I could easily grant.

56
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,416
You should have asked for that
instead of the Ether Reactor.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,833
Sorry. I wasn't clear enough.

58
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,333
I meant, I want to build
my own Silhouette Knight.

59
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,083
It won't be special unless
I make it with my own hands.

60
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,416
You believe you can make a
Silhouette Knight from scratch?

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
[ERNESTI]
I do, indeed.

62
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,708
[AMBROSIUS] And why is this
so important to you?

63
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:05,000
Because... it's my hobby, sire!

64
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,291
[AMBROSIUS laughing]

65
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,125
What a ridiculous answer!

66
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,208
You surprise me, boy.
And that is not an easy feat!

67
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,041
Sorry! Please be merciful.

68
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,333
I promise to give my grandson
a stern talking to.

69
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,916
--[AMBROSIUS] Granted.
--[gasps]

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,833
The knowledge shall be yours.

71
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,416
--Majesty!
--[AMBROSIUS] However,

72
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,291
slaying a mere behemoth is not
enough to justify your request.

73
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,708
If you truly want
the Ether Reactor,

74
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,583
you must first prove
to me that you can make

75
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,208
good use of its power.

76
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,416
Okay, how would you like me
to go about that, your majesty?

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
[AMBROSIUS]
Build your Knight.

78
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,666
Though, for this challenge,
you will merely

79
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,250
need to create a chassis.

80
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,083
If your new design impresses me

81
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,541
and can satisfy my standards,
then I will grant your wish

82
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,708
and your dream
will be a reality.

83
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,625
[giggling]
I won't fail you, sire!

84
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,166
[SELESTINA] The next day,
the Marquis, Joachim of Selati,

85
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,208
invited his children back
from Laihiala Academy.

86
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,791
[STEPHANIA]
Father. It's good to see you.

87
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,041
[giggles]

88
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,458
Indeed. It seems
you're doing well.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,916
So, uh, what's the reason
you summoned us here, Father?

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,416
[JOACHIM]
Stephania informs me

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,416
that you two are rather close
to Ernesti Echevalier.

92
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,208
[ARCHID]
Um. Yeah?

93
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,000
[JOACHIM]
His majesty the king has taken

94
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,166
quite a liking to him, as well.

95
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,625
[BOTH gasp]

96
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,250
[JOACHIM] I'm interested
in the boy's progress.

97
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,291
If he is successful in any way,
let me know at once.

98
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,083
I would like to be the first
to inform his majesty.

99
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,916
I don't know-- If we do that,
will it help Ernie?

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,083
Yes, of course.
Though, I would appreciate it

101
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,708
if you didn't tell him
we talked about this.

102
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,541
I don't want it to distract him.
His task is daunting enough.

103
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,541
[GUY 3A]
Hey, is this right?

104
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,125
[GUY 3B]
No! This one goes here!

105
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,458
That one goes there!

106
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,541
If I see anyone slacking,
you'll get my foot up your ass!

107
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,041
What happened here?

108
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,708
I just replaced this
Crystal Tissue!

109
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,083
It looks like it's
been to hell and back.

110
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,291
How did they put it through
this much stress in one night?

111
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,416
Beautiful.

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,750
Uh!

113
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,458
Even like this they're elegant.
In their own way.

114
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,208
The form collapses,
and only the wreckage remains.

115
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,416
This is true,
refined beauty! Uh!

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,791
And then, when you realize
you're responsible for it,

117
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,291
you're not sure
whether to feel guilty

118
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,750
or proud of the destruction!

119
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,875
Who the hell are you?

120
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,375
Please, don't you
mind him, boss!

121
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,458
Sorry! David!
I was just leaving!

122
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,750
Hold it!

123
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,083
So, kid.
You're responsible for this?

124
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,333
I'd like to hear
how you managed it.

125
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,583
[DAVID]
Sorry, can you go over it again?

126
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,291
Sure! It's simple.

127
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,041
I copied out all of the scripts
from the Magius Engine,

128
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,708
did the calculations myself,

129
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,916
and used the custom scripts
to pilot the unit.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,750
[DAVID] Let's say,
hypothetically, that you did.

131
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,291
What does any of that have to do
with the way Guiar fell apart?

132
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,166
Well, I was effectively
a stand-in for the engine.

133
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,916
That allowed me
to remove all its limiters

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
and do whatever I wanted.

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,583
I took every ounce
of mana it had to give

136
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,125
and used it to attack.

137
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,791
Of course, that depleted
the enhancement magic

138
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,750
holding the frame together.

139
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,250
That sound like
a decent summary to you?

140
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,916
Or were you busy
pissin' yourself?

141
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,625
[ERNESTI chuckles softly]

142
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,500
Yeah, that about
sums it up, boss.

143
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,125
[ERNESTI]
Dietrich really surprised me!

144
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,875
He was incredible out there!

145
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,416
I would have been roasted
without his help!

146
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,250
That last attack on
the behemoth would have been

147
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,125
impossible to pull off alone.

148
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,541
We made a great team!

149
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[DIETRICH] No. Please.
I didn't do anything.

150
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,541
Why are you so gloomy?
It's a time to celebrate!

151
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,583
We should be
praising the Guair!

152
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,250
Sure, kid. Whatever.

153
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,583
Let's get back on topic.

154
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,958
You're telling me,
if you use your full strength,

155
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,291
any Knight that you piloted
would end up just like Guair?

156
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,750
If it's a current model?

157
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,500
Yeah, it would
pretty much be scrap.

158
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,500
Ugh! You idiot!

159
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,166
We can't build a new unit
every other day!

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,333
You don't have to!

161
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,791
I've already come up
with the solution.

162
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,750
[DAVID]
Is this really Crystal Tissue?

163
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,375
It would increase
structural integrity tenfold!

164
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,750
And power!

165
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,625
I call it the
Strand-Type Crystal Tissue!

166
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,500
[DAVID]
Huh. Amazing.

167
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,666
We only swapped out
30% muscle mass,

168
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,541
and it worked great!

169
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,833
Each fiber is
fairly weak on its own.

170
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,916
But weaving them together

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,125
dramatically increases
their strength.

172
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,250
And, compared to laying them
out in a straight line,

173
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,083
this allows them
to expand and contract

174
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,458
over a greater distance, which
leads to greater energy output!

175
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,958
Well, I'll be damned.

176
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,625
Instead of just
repairing all these units,

177
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,958
we're giving them an upgrade!

178
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,833
Before you do,
I have one more idea.

179
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,916
What if we made an alteration
to the humanoid shape?

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
[DAVID]
Hmm. All right.

181
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,708
I'll hear you out. Lay it on me.

182
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,208
--[HELVI] Boss.
--'Bout time!

183
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,458
Good to see you again!

184
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,791
Oh, Ernesti?
What are you doing in here?

185
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,375
Ah, just living the dream.

186
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,250
Pardon?

187
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,666
[ERNESTI]
Helvi, I wanted to talk to you

188
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
about the Trandorkis.

189
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,958
[HELVI] Yeah.
It's a real mess, isn't it?

190
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,291
[ERNESTI] Don't worry,
the boss will have it

191
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,833
as good as new in no time.
In fact, he'll make it

192
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,166
even stronger
and faster than before!

193
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,708
--Really?
--Yup!

194
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,458
But we need your help.

195
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,500
That's why we called you here.

196
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,958
All right.

197
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,541
[ERNESTI] Silhouette Knights
have only ever had

198
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,708
two arms to work with.

199
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,083
But when you stop
to think about it,

200
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,458
it's not as efficient
as it could be.

201
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,791
To use magic in combat,
Knight Runners need to switch

202
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,583
from sword to rod, and
vice versa for melee combat.

203
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,583
It takes time,
and in that split second,

204
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,083
while the Knight Runner
is vulnerable,

205
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,333
a demon beast could
gain the upper hand.

206
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,125
True. But we're so used
to swapping on the fly,

207
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,500
it's a simple matter.

208
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,375
Sure. But I think we can
make it even simpler.

209
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,166
Humor me for a moment.

210
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:44,750
What if... we added another pair
of arms to the back of the unit?

211
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,083
Aah?

212
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,791
[ALL]
Uh...

213
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,708
Interesting thought.
But that form is traditional.

214
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,208
Silhouette Knights have always
been based on humans.

215
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,375
That's part of the reason we're
able to operate them so easily.

216
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,375
I mean, sure, we could
put arms in the back,

217
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,416
but how are we
supposed to move 'em?

218
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,125
No need to worry.
They're not going to be

219
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,125
fully-functional limbs.
They're only purpose will be

220
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,208
to hold the rod
so the pilot can fire them.

221
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,875
It's a crude design, but it will
work for the testing phase.

222
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,291
For convenience, we'll refer
to the rod the sub-arms

223
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,666
are holding as
the unit's "back weapon."

224
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,916
We'll use a dedicated script to
control the sub-arms movement.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,208
This will include gripping
and moving the back weapon.

226
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,583
We'll also add an aiming
function to the basic controls.

227
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,500
And with a targeting reticle
on the heads-up display,

228
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,041
all the Knight Runner
has to do is aim and fire.

229
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,750
[HELVI] It's simpler
than I thought it would be.

230
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,083
With enough practice,
I bet I could use the sword

231
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,708
and rod at the
same time, no sweat.

232
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,416
Their form may be "human,"

233
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,208
but Silhouette Knights
are just advanced tools.

234
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,500
If there's some function
we want them to have,

235
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,208
don't you think we should
change that form to create it?

236
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,208
Tell me, silver hair.
You sure you're a human?

237
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,500
I mean, how do you
come up with these ideas?

238
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,541
I've never seen or heard
of anything like 'em.

239
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,125
[ERNESTI]
Because they don't exist!

240
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,875
That's why I'm making them!

241
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,708
It's called invention!

242
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,083
[ARCHID]
Hey, Ernie.

243
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,250
[ERNESTI]
What's up?

244
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,625
[ARCHID]
If you add those things,

245
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,750
Silhouette Knights
will get even stronger.

246
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,625
[ERNESTI]
Yup. That's the plan.

247
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,000
Be honest. Once you finish them,

248
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,791
you'll fight the
demon beasts again, right?

249
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,666
Uh. Well, yeah.
Of course, I will.

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,666
That's a Knight Runner's
job, after all.

251
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,291
The entire kingdom
counts on us for protection.

252
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,708
[ARCHID]
Then let us help.

253
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,583
There must be
something we can do.

254
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,791
[ADELTRUD] Please, Ernie!
The thought of you facing

255
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,333
demon beasts by yourself
is worse than death!

256
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,208
I don't ever want to
feel that helpless again.

257
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,416
Let us fight
those monsters with you!

258
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,916
The next time you face a demon,
I won't be stuck in a carriage!

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
You taught us magic,
so you can teach us

260
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,208
to be Knight Runners, too!

261
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,583
[gasps]
You got it!

262
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,166
And I've already come up
with the perfect plan!

263
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,083
You're sure you can
pull this off? Honest?

264
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,291
[ERNESTI] I am.
I just need your permission.

265
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,625
[LAURI] Most of the units
are being repaired now,

266
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,708
what your proposing would keep
them out of commission longer.

267
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
The creation or major overhaul

268
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,416
of a Silhouette Knight
is complicated.

269
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,875
The whole process
will require parts and time,

270
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,583
not to mention
plenty of manpower.

271
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,500
If I'm going to achieve
a simpler way

272
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,875
to construct Silhouette
Knights, I need this.

273
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,791
But, first, I'll make
a practice model!

274
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,875
Thank you all for coming out.

275
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,250
As you can see, this new
machine is far simpler

276
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,000
than a full-sized unit.

277
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,416
They'll be essential
for testing,

278
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
and I'd like all of
you to construct them

279
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,708
with Batson leading the project.

280
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,333
Us? Make those things?

281
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,750
[SELESTINA] And so, Ernie's new
plans were set in motion.

282
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,458
Soon, the entire school
would be involved.

283
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,625
[DAVID hollering]

284
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,125
The new Crystal Tissue
worked as we intended,

285
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,041
but the underlying framework's
completely blown out!

286
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,083
I didn't think of that!
[laughing]

287
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,708
Guess we'll be burning
the midnight oil on this one.

288
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,291
We're counting you! Good luck!

289
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,208
Okay! Time to get
some training in!

290
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,458
Take it easy, you moron!

291
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,541
We just finished
tuning that one!

292
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,583
[ADELTRUD]
Mm?

293
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,000
Ah. Your frame's
so cold and hard.

294
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,083
My dear, you're perfect!

295
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,583
No fair. I would do anything
for Ernesti to say that to me.

296
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,083
Why can't I be a made of metal?

297
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,875
[EDGAR grunting]

298
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,208
[ERNESTI]
Hey, Edgar! How's it feel?

299
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,041
I think they're running
pretty smoothly!

300
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,916
I'm still trying to walk!

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,458
[yells]

302
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,916
Fun, huh? It just takes
some getting used to.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,958
Look, Ernesti. I get that
these Silhouette Gears

304
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,625
are important to you and all,

305
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,291
it's just, the controls
are complicated,

306
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,416
and they use too much mana.

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,375
There's no way using these
will serve as a replacement

308
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,666
for Silhouette Knight training.

309
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
You really think so?

310

One, two!

00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,625
--[ARCHID] Alley-oop!
--One, two!

312
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,500
Well, those two are unique.

313
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,583
Couldn't you incorporate
a Magius Engine, at least?

314
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,125
That way... I could operate
this thing with ease.

315
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,875
[DIETRICH]
Quit complaining, Edgar!

316
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,750
It's pathetic!
You're the top knight

317
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,791
in Laihiala! Act like it!

318
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,708
What have you done
with Dietrich?

319
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,708
[DIETRICH] Very funny.
These Gear things really

320
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,500
force you to think about
how much mana you're using.

321
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,375
Knight Runners of any level
could learn a lot

322
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,791
training with them!

323
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,083
[ARCHID] Hey, D!
Wanna play tag? You're it!

324
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,666
[DIETRICH]
Not for long!

325
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,791
[ADELTRUD, ARCHID laughing]

326
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,291
He sure changed. What happened?

327
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,750
[SELESTINA] After tons of
research, trials, and revisions,

328
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,416
a modified Silhouette
Knight was completed!

329
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,916
Now, it was time
to put Ernesti's

330
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,208
new alterations to the test!

331
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,625
[DAVID]
All set?

332
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,291
When you're ready,
try standing up!

333
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,208
--[BATSON] Yeah!
--It stood!

334
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,291
Now, try taking a step or two!

335
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,333
Nice and easy!

336
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,458
[sighs]

337
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,708
[DAVID]
Okay, stop!

338
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,500
How's it feel?

339
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,541
[HELVI] About as rough
as you'd expect.

340
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,333
It's got a lot of power,
so it's hard to make it

341
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,291
work the way I want it to.

342
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,875
We'll worry about
tuning it after the test.

343
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,583
Our goal for today
is seeing those in action.

344
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,166
Those Silhouette Gears
are really something else.

345
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,000
Just goes to show they're
more than meets the eye.

346
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,041
[HELVI]
Deploying the sub-arms now.

347
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,791
Displaying reticle.
Lock target. And fire!

348
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
[ENGINEERS gasp]

349
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,833
It's even more accurate
than I'd hoped!

350
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,250
[HELVI] Test fire complete.
Retracting sub-arms.

351
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
[DAVID]
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

352
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,625
Looks good!

353
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,958
[ENGINEERS crying, laughing]

354
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,750
Uh, they're happy about
something like that?

355
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,125
Isn't it more impressive if you
use the magic yourself, Ernie?

356
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,875
Well, with this, we can
increase firepower at will!

357
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,541
But what's important is that
our hard work payed off.

358
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,208
This Silhouette Knight
took its first steps today.

359
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,416
And that is worthy
of a few happy tears.

360
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,541
I don't really get it, but I'm
happy for you, nonetheless.

361
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,041
Congratulations, Ernie!

362
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,958
[EDGAR] What's your take
on this new equipment, D?

363
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,333
[DIETRICH] Hmm, well.
It won't just help with

364
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,250
long-range combat,
but close quarters, too.

365
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,583
I like it.

366
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,083
[EDGAR]
True, but it's one thing

367
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,833
if we're up against
demon beasts.

368
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,958
What happens if we have
to fight the new unit?

369
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,750
[HELVI] I'll tell you.
You'll get knocked flat

370
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,083
on your "Top Knight" backside!

371
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,541
With this new power,
no one's a match for me!

372
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,041
Even the great Edgar couldn't
go toe-to-toe with my baby.

373
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,958
Somehow, I doubt that's true.

374
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,708
Do you have the guts
to find out?

375
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:38,666
[CROWD murmuring]

376
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,666
[EDGAR] Jeez. They didn't have
to make a big deal of this.

377
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,750
It's only a mock battle.

378
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,458
[HELVI] You better not
think of backing out on me.

379
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,291
[DAVID] If you're both ready,
we can get this started!

380
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,541
This is the last trial!

381
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,416
We get to see what
our new unit can really do!

382
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,583
To my right, the new
and re-named Telestale,

383
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,958
and its opponent,
the battle-hardened Earlcumber!

384
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,916
[DAVID]
Knights! Bow!

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,875
Take positions!

386
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,666
It may be shiny and new,
but that won't decide the fight.

387
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,750
It always come down to skill!

388
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,083
I won't forget you, Trandorkis.

389
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,500
Thank you. For everything.

390
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,458
Let's go, Telestale!

391
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,916
--Begin!
--[gong rings]

392
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,708
Why isn't she taking advantage
of her longer-range?

393
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,958
Let's give a proper hello!

394
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,041
[HELVI grunting]

395
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,166
The Strand-Type's
power is unreal!

396
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,583
I didn't think it was possible!

397
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,666
But if being around Ernesti
has taught me anything,

398
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,791
it's that moving forward means
throwing away what you know!

399
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,041
Well, that's Edgar for you.
Stubborn as a wall.

400
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,083
Any other pilot would've
been done for by now.

401
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,458
Helvi's using the Telestale
like she's had it for years.

402
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,041
And that,
my silver haired friend,

403
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,333
is the reason
she's a test-runner.

404
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,625
[DIETRICH] She's pushing it
awfully hard, though.

405
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,916
[ERNESTI]
Probably taking advantage

406
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,708
of the superior output.

407
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,291
And there's plenty of tuning
to do on the control system.

408
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,708
Fighting with precision
isn't viable yet.

409
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,083
So, it's strength versus skill.

410
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,041
Can't wait to see who wins.

411
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,083
Her close-range magic is tough!
I can't counter it!

412
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,791
I don't like
to gamble in a fight,

413
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,041
but being backed into
a corner just isn't fun!

414
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,875
[HELVI]
A head-on attack?

415
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,333
I'd expect nothing less
from you, Edgar!

416
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,208
If you're going all out,
then so will I!

417
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,000
[HELVI]
Gotcha!

418
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,875
How the hell did he
manage that block?

419
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,333
Come on! We just built that!

420
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:08,125
That's how you want to play?
Fine, we'll take it up a notch!

421
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,958
Give him everything
we've got, Telestale!

422
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,458
This fight is over!

423
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,333
[HELVI]
Uh!

424
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,833
Oh! Out of mana!

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,375
[DAVID]
Thanks to all of you,

426
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,458
the new Tellestale
passed its trials.

427
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,625
Great work, everyone.

428
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,625
Moving forward,
we'll deal with the decreased

429
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,583
fuel efficiency that we
discovered in the mock battle.

430
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,291
Ahem. Well,
enough of that. Drink up!

431
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,916
[ENGINEERS]
Yes, sir!

432
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
[ENGINEERS laughing]

433
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,125
Get over there
and cheer Helvi up.

434
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,625
Why me? You do it!

435
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,625
--I'm excited!
--Why?

436
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,833
Won't get the king
reward you for all this?

437
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,291
You practically
made history today!

438
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,416
Yeah! You've changed the
Silhouette Knight forever.

439
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,250
Well, not quite yet.
The Telestale may be finished,

440
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,666
but it's nowhere near completed.
We've got a long way to go.

441
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,541
Was afraid he'd say that.

442
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,416
We're walking
a difficult path, here.

443
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,333
It can't be trod
in just one day.

444
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,666
[EDGAR chuckles]
Yeah, okay.

445
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,208
[door creaks]

446
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,916
[KERHILD] Hmm. So, his pet
project isn't finished yet?

447
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,208
All right. We'll stick
around and see

448
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,208
what else he has in store.

449
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,000
[SELESTINA] By this time,
a tiny thorn had already

450
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,250
embedded itself
in Laihiala Academy.

451
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:56,166
Unfortunately, no one,
not even Ernesti,

452
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,875
had noticed its presence.

453
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,458
[ERNESTI]
Next time: "Light &amp; Shadow"!

454
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
Machiavellianism is calling me!
