2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,625
No, come back!

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,541
I haven't built any of you yet!

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,333
You can't leave me like this!

5
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,583
Please, robot!
Don't go, I'm begging you!

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,583
[ADELTRUD sighs]

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,791
How can someone be so huggable?

8
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,833
This is becoming a habit.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,333
Every time I doze off, Addy
grabs me then passes out, too.

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,125
I'm not her personal teddy bear.

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,500
[ADELTRUD]
Cuddle wuddle.

12
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:51,041
Addy, time to wake up.
I can't move with you on me.

13
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,041
But you're just so warm, Ernie.
It makes me happy.

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,250
[ERNESTI]
Mmm.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,083
[ADELTRUD laughing]
Okay! I'm up!

16
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,291
Stop! You're so mean, Ernie!

17
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,041
That's not what you said
a second ago.

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,041
Rise and shine.
We're almost home.

19
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,583
[SELESTINA] After the Casadesus
Incident came to a conclusion,

20
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:15,875
Ernesti and the others
returned to Laihiala.

21
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,958
Meanwhile,
the Telestale was sent

22
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,500
to the nation's
greatest research lab.

23
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,708
The renowned
Silhouette Knight Laboratory.

24
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,791
[GAIZKA]
What's the hold up?

25
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,500
A pre-pubescent child
designed this pile of scrap!

26
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,708
How long could it
take you to analyze?

27
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,125
With all due respect, sir,

28
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,458
this Strand-Type Crystal Tissue
and back-arm technology

29
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,625
are unlike anything
we've seen before.

30
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,041
The script work alone
will take us some time.

31
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,333
Not to mention the work
he did on the Magius Engine.

32
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,708
Don't look so damn impressed!

33
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,625
Where's your pride
as a lab member?

34
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,500
[OLVER]
Chief.

35
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,041
Yelling won't get
the work done any faster.

36
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,416
How wonderful! If it
isn't director Olver!

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,625
What brings you to our
humble corner of the lab?

38
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,666
Last I heard, you sat
in your chair so long

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,083
you sprouted roots!

40
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,750
I had to see the new
unit for myself.

41
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,500
Innovations are something
of a rarity around here.

42
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,166
I'm quite eager to read
your analysis of the unit.

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,750
When should I expect it?

44
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,125
When it's ready and
not a moment before.

45
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,750
Now, if you'll excuse me, I am
far too busy for this nonsense.

46
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:18,208
As I feared. This lab has been
stuck in a rut for so long

47
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,000
this project may have been
too much for us.

48
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:24,125
His majesty won't
be happy about this.

49
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,625
Unless, he intended for this
to shake us up a bit.

50
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,458
[GAIZKA] Stupid brat!
Sucking up to the king

51
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,541
doesn't make you
cock of the walk!

52
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,000
[grunting]

53
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,916
Enjoy this while you can.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Once I've figured out
how to use your unit

55
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,458
to create a new
mass-produced model,

56
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:44,250
your part in Silhouette Knight
history will just be a footnote!

57
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,750
[laughing, coughing]

58
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,916
[AMBROSIUS] I see.
So, he's back at Laihiala.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,208
Yes.

60
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,791
I know you have
your reservations,

61
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,166
but we need their power.

62
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,208
I don't need to tell you
how complicated

63
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,250
things have gotten around here.

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,625
Yes.

65
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,291
[AMBROSIUS] Those damn raiders
didn't help matters.

66
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,083
[KNUT]
I've been thinking about that.

67
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,875
I believe someone from the
Occident may have sent them.

68
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,666
[AMBROSIUS]
Mmm.

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,000
[SELESTINA] The Occident is the
name given to the countries

70
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,875
west of Fremmevilla.

71
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,458
Which lie beyond the border
of the Aubigne Mountains.

72
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,708
The very thought is enraging--
The only reason why

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,750
they have peace is due to
our constant efforts

74
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,833
to fight off the demon beasts.

75
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,000
The attack on Casadesus
must have been ordered

76
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
by someone who's
forgotten that fact.

77
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,833
Whoever is behind this
treachery, we must respond.

78
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,625
As of now, I'm putting you
in charge of the Azure Hawk.

79
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,375
Consider it a chance to atone
for your failure at the Fort.

80
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,791
Yes. I will, sire.

81
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,791
Now then, I can't wait
to see what young Echevalier

82
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,541
has in store for us next.

83
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,125
The future's looking
bright indeed.

84
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,416
As you say, sire.

85
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,583
[ALL]
You're a Knight Commander?

86
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,000
Yup! It was just made official.

87
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,583
I'm in charge of the
Order of the Silver Phoenix.

88
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,250
But don't worry, I'll continue
my studies through graduation,

89
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,083
like all the other students.

90
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,791
That wasn't my concern!

91
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,791
His majesty should be
sending an official notice

92
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,791
with all of the details soon.

93
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,166
Until then, you should know that
the Academy of Knight Runners

94
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,375
and its facilities will serve
as our base of operations.

95
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,000
Ah! That's wonderful!

96
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,416
Right?

97
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,125
So, it's finally happened.

98
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,000
I always said you would
take over the school

99
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,666
but for it to happen so soon...

100
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,583
[DAVID] I wasn't really thinkin'
about it when I agreed, but...

101
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,333
...we're a Knightly Order!
How 'bout that?

102
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,875
Consider yourself lucky, boss.

103
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,291
At least you got
to be there. Not me.

104
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,500
I was stuck in the infirmary
with a concussion and bedpan.

105
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,750
He was worrying
himself sick, too.

106
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,083
I think he was afraid
we wouldn't let him join.

107
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,541
That's not true! Take it back!

108
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,916
Things have gone
from interesting

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,458
to insane around here.

110
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,958
With Ernie in charge, this is
gonna be one hell of a ride.

111
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,291
[distant clanking]

112
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,958
Good, you're all
already here! Perfect timing!

113
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,875
How's Batson piloting a gear?

114
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,250
Ernie! Did you do
somethin' weird?

115
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,666
Not at all! Care to tell them
what makes this design special?

116
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,416
It's got a miniaturized
Magius Engine inside it!

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,083
[chuckles]
Even someone like me can use it.

118
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,500
But that's high-grade
military tech!

119
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,541
Where the hell'd you
get <i>your</i> hands on it?

120
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,083
From the government!

121
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,333
I asked for it,
and they gave it to me!

122
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,791
<i>Gave</i> it to you?

123
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,375
Hold on. I thought
the engine was secret.

124
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,250
Well, not as much
as Ether Reactors.

125
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,875
But, yeah, they're not
something you can just ask for.

126
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,083
Guess the rules
don't apply to Ernie.

127
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,750
Batson's not the only one
who can use the new design.

128
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,541
Every one of the
Knightsmiths should be able

129
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,708
to operate them
with minimal practice.

130
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,083
You don't say.

131
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,541
We could get twice the work
done with those babies.

132
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,791
[ARCHID]
Hey! Ernie!

133
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,041
Big news! Really big!

134
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
--What the--?
--Well, I'll be.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,166
[DIETRICH] This day
just keeps getting better.

136
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,916
Two companies of Kaldatoahs.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,458
The Marquis apologizes
for the delay.

138
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,666
It's no problem!

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,333
Your work is impressive.

140
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,000
I might even let you
tune-up the Haimerwort.

141
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:47,000
If that happens,
you won't be disappointed.

142
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,458
So, there's definitely no

143
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,458
backing out of this now,
is there?

144
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,791
It's tough,
but it'll be worth it!

145
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,291
I wish you could see your face.
I've never seen you so happy!

146
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,250
Yeah!

147
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,375
Everyone. The time has come
to hit them where it hurts!

148
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,750
Hit who where?

149
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,291
I'll get to that. The Order
of the Silver Phoenix

150
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,916
may be new,
but we've been fulfilling

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,958
our knightly duty
for some time now.

152
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,958
The development of
a new unit, right?

153
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,708
Yes. His majesty has
given us the greater goal

154
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,250
of making the best machine
we possibly can.

155
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,958
But that's not all he's done.

156
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,833
He's issued a challenge
for our Order,

be excited about it.

158

In ten months, we'll have
a mock battle with a unit

from the Casadesus Incident,

00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to make a mech that has
superior speed and mobility.

It would help a lot.

We're only making <i>one</i> new unit?

But don't worry.
I'm preparing Option Works

182
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,500
so it can adapt
during the mock battle.

183

What are Option Works?

184
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,166
Equipment that will
allow us to use new tactics!

185
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,333
Take the Flexible Coat
for example.

186
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,000
Instead of holding a rod
like the back weapon sub-arm,

187
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,916
this sub-arm will hold
a protective shield instead.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,708
The possibilities are limitless!

189

Okay.

You might finally make
your dream come true, Ernie.

That's what I'm hoping.

[ERNESTI]
I only get glimpses of it.

194
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,916
But there's a robot made just
for me somewhere in my head.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,666
The new unit
and the Option Works

196
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,583
are all vital stepping stones
towards finding it.

I can't reach it in my dreams.

Thank you.

This is our latest
prototype, the Tzendolg.

As well as two Telestale
derivatives equipped with

our new Option Works
and the Guair custom!

As commanded,
the Silver Phoenix has arrived!

Next time: "New &amp; Old"!

00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,916
They're telling me
to burn bright!
