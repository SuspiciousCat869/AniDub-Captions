That's about one
too many to arrest.

163
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,291
Yeah, I don't know.
Sounds risky.

164
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,333
In the midst of the guaranteed
chaos, it seems like a good

165
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
chance we might
end up getting cuffed.

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,083
You've got every right
to be suspicious.

167
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,875
Plenty on the force that'd
love to see that happen.

168
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,541
But try to think big here.

169
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,291
An event of this magnitude?

170
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,416
You know word's already
gotten out to anyone

171
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,041
with sharp enough ears.

172
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,791
If the chaos gets drawn out,

173
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,000
there's no doubt more
dangerous elements

174
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,875
will take the opportunity
to make their move.

has already made up his mind.

00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,708
All right, Lieutenant Daniel
Law, it seems you're

181
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
getting your way.

182
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,750
Guess you'll just
have to owe us one.

183
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,041
You got it.

184
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,958
Exactly why no one's
arresting you right now.

Steven here.

188

[ABRAMS] So this is
the building you slammed

189
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,500

[STARPHASE]
Uh, yeah.

191
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,916
[KLAUS] It was
strategically unavoidable.

192

[ABRAMS]
Of course.

193
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,291
It's a little unusual, huh?

194
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,416
Them suddenly calling
us in like this?

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,291
Yeah, to say the least.

196
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,250
[ABRAMS] And frankly,
I don't have a very good

High Order Spirituals.

There's no reason to
resort to such formality.

Hello, Klaus.

Hello, Steven.

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,458
[STARPHASE]
Long time.

218
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,333
[ABRAMS] I don't think I'll
ever get used to seeing it.

219
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,666
The world-bounding
powers you casters have.

220
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,250
[ANGELICA] Sure. And
just think about this.

221
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,875
If you stuck around, you'd be
the most normal person here.

222
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,625
[ELDER] Showing off
is not a sound reason

223
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,791
to use your power
so excessively.

224
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,333
How many times
must I remind you...

225
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,541
[ANGELICA]
Oh, hi, Doctor!

226
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,000
[ELDER] ...there is
a price to all things?

227
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,416
Our powers are
not for ourselves,

228
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,125
but for the people
the world over.

229
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,625
And they must be used
with only them in mind.

230
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,041
[ANGELICA]
Right.

231
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,666

Mm-hm.

I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

And I apologize for my pupil.

Regardless, I'm glad
you could make it.

[DANIEL] It's Daniel. I got that
info on the missing units.

239
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,666
They're mechanized
foot soldiers

240
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,541
built for China's
mobile infantry.

00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,750
The People's
Bright Star, type 3.

242
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,083
It's definitely an older
model. Almost a relic.

243
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,583
But they made 'em to last.
And they're sturdy as hell,

244
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,541
which is just one of the reasons
they were a global best-seller.

245
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,083
But they'd have to be, or they
never would've produced

246
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,750
a thousand of 'em.

247
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,083
So basically they're cheap,
they're nasty, and they're

248
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,958
the perfect instrument
for a full swarming siege.

The big question is
how do you quietly ship

that damn many of them?

00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,416
things have only gotten worse.

320
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,208
Yo! Come on in.

321
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,416
Pardon the mess, but
the Grinjko Familia,

322
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,041
or whoever the hell they were,

323
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,500
kept tryin' to force me to sell
my shop so they could flip it.

324
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,875
Ya walked in right after I gave
the scumbags my final answer.

325
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,833
I just got word
their lieutenant's on

326
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,833
his way here to retaliate.

327
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,791
Figured I should give him
a taste of my passion

328
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,583
for this business, so I'm
whippin' up a special broth.

329
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,583
You guys care for a bowl?

330
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
[ALL]
Mm-mm!

331
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,041
[CHAIN] I'm checking out our
lead in Little Akiba right now,

332
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,166
but he's clean.

333
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
[groaning]

334
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,208
He fell asleep while playing
some porno video game.

335
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,416
[STARPHASE]
How can you tell?

336
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,791
What was it again?

337
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,875
It's called Starry Sleep
Station Part Six and it

338
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,458
just got released today!

339
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,083
I swore I wouldn't sleep
until I beat the 5th level,

340
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,083
which includes
Lemuria the Librarian,

341
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,916
the ruthless and dreaded
Sasha the Kazunagian,

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,583
and the Cliff Palace
Route Twins!

343
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,666
[heavy breathing]

344
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,125
[STARPHASE]
Right, so he's a nerd?

345
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,166
[CHAIN]
So it seems.

346
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
What the hell was that?

347
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,375
Hey. I'm just as
confused as you.

348
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,250
I've got a bad feeling
we're nowhere near

349
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,083
stopping this thing in time.

350
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,333
[LEO]
It's hopeless!

351
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,083
We're never gonna eat again!

352
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,833
We're doomed to starve!

353
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,083
Please, God of Chow,
he's too stupid--

354
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,625
[ZAPP]
What is the God of Chow?

355
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,291
[LEO] This is all because you
were using food for hazing.

356
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,791
Don't you realize you've
cursed us, you fool?

357
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
You are somehow making
a scene in this city.

358
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,291
It's Divine Famishment!

359
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,416
[LEO]
Food!

360
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,875
Punishment! Punishment!

361
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,416
This is bad.

362
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,916
I mean, sure, yeah,
he freaks out a lot

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,125
but this is just worrisome.

364
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,750
[ZED] He's starting to
speak in tongues.

365
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,916
So he's either receiving visions
or creating his own religion.

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,083
We need to get him some help.

367
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,041
Is there anywhere
he feels comfortable?

368
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,541
Maybe someplace that
reminds him of home?

369
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,958
[ZAPP]
Yeah, there is.

370
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,458
Y'know,

371
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,708
we really should've just gone
there in the first place.

372
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,791
What's up, guys?

373
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:45,875
Uh.

374
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,250
What's wrong with Leo?

375
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,583
[ZAPP]
It looks okay, right?

376
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,916
[ZED]
Yeah.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,416
What's going on?
What's with all the tension?

378
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,208
[ZED, ZAPP sigh]

379
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,708
Okay, look.

380
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,750
If someone's trying to kill
you guys or something,

381
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,041
please go somewhere else.

382
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,875
[groans]

383
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,291
[ZAPP] All right, Leo!
Pull it together!

384
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,666
[ZED]
It's okay now.

385
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,416
You guys are acting even
more suspicious than usual.

386
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,666
--[chomping]
--[VIVIAN] Whatever.

387
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,083
What's your order?

388
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,500
Hamburger, spaghetti with meat
sauce, and a large Peps!

389
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,125
[ding]

390
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,208
I'll take that as well.

391
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,791
And I'll have the same.

392
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,083
[VIVIAN]
You got it.

393
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,833
[ALL sigh]

394
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,333
I'm not gonna ask what
you got yourself into,

395
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,000
but these guys are
a bad influence.

396
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,125
You don't wanna start acting
paranoid like them, do you, Leo?

397
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
What would your
parents think about you

398
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,083
hanging out with these two?

399
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,041
--[ZAPP] Hey, parents love me!
--[ZED] I am not paranoid!

400
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,666
[VIVIAN]
Heh, but then again,

401
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,500
having a group of friends
you can eat with

402
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,708
is always a good thing, y'know?

403
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,208
Mm?

404
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,416
[chuckles softly]

405
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
[VIVIAN] Come to think of it,
you've been bringing in

406
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,250
a lot of new people
with you lately.

407
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,583
You always just used to
sit there by yourself.

408
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,291
[ZAPP]
Aw, really? Is that true?

409
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,833
How lonesome.

410
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,750
Aren't you lucky you've
got me around? Huh, Leo?

411
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,916
Huh?

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,500
[laughs]

413
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,125
Yeah, actually.

414
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,500
I am lucky.

415
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
[VIVIAN]
Right? [laughs]

416
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,500
Why is your skin doing that?
You aren't blushing, are you?

417
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,666
Huh?

418
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,333
[crying]

419
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,708
Ah, don't cry, Leo!

420
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,416
We're fine, now!

421
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,041
[alien spaceship sounds]

422
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,583
[cars colliding]

423
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,541
[ABRAMS] I'm sorry we
had to end our meeting

424
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,458
so abruptly earlier, Elder.

425
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,500
[ELDER] Oh, it was
expected to some degree.

426
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,916
You are, without a doubt,
one of the busiest people

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,375
operating in this city.

428
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,916
So think nothing of it.

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,833
To pick up from
where we left off,

430
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,750
one of the barriers is damaged.

431
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,708
The one that was
positioned right here,

432
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,791
and it happened during
your men's battle

433
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,875
in the building above.

434
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:06,875
You mean...

435
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,500
Don't tell me that we...

436
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
[ELDER] Oh, no. It's not
something that can be

437
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,416
physically damaged, so
the blame lies elsewhere.

438
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,041
--You're fine.
--[ABRAMS sighs]

439
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,791
[ELDER] It's still more than a
little bit disconcerting though,

440
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,166
which is precisely
why I called you here.

441
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,541
[whistling]

442
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,333
[crowd noise]

--[panting]
--[gasps]

444
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,125
Hey.

445
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,666
[heavy breathing]

446
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,500
Most vexing.

447
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,000
Within the barrier that we
raised three years ago,

448
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,833
there is one among
the casters whose

449
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,333
whereabouts remain unknown.

450
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,166
Let me go! Please!

451
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,208
They'll kill me if
they catch me!

452
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,833
[struggling]

453
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,916
--[PUNK 1] There's the brat!
--[PUNK 2] Hey, hold her!

454
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,000
[ELDER] The caster couple
who was in charge died

455
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,166
during the collapse.

456
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,666
There was so much
confusion at the time,

457
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,625
we weren't fully
aware of the situation.

458
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,875
Hey! Pipsqueak!

459
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,208
Didn't ya hear us tellin' ya
to hold onto that kid?

460
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,583
[ELDER]
The thing is,

461
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,625
someone did manage to make
it out of there alive.

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,250
The children of the dead
caster couple, in fact.

463
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,458
[KING OF DESPAIR] Hey.
How about we play a game?

464
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,541
--[PUNK 1] Hmm?
--[PUNK 2] Huh?

465
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,000
What the hell are
you talkin' bout?

466
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,250
[KING OF DESPAIR]
If you guys win,

467
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,666
I'll respectfully step aside.

468
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,541
Hell, I'll even catch that
kid you're after for you.

469

Eh?

have to do is guess what I am.

[KING OF DESPAIR]
Take a guess.

473
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,750
You already know
my name, don't you?

474
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,000
I only know you screwed up,
you friggin' idio--

475
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,625
Uh.

476

Guess that makes it your turn.

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,041
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Go on and try to figure out

479
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,375
what I am.

480
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,291
[choking, whimpering]

481
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,791
[KING OF DESPAIR]
But, if by some chance

482
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,125
your answer is wrong...

483
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,833
I'll have no choice but
to blow your soul to bits.

484
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,541
[laughs]

485
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,666
One of them is
even now serving

486
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,625
in the LHOS as a caster.

487
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,000
The other child though--

488
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,708
[WHITE]
Hey, Leo!

489
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,000
Mm?

490
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,291
[LEO]
Hey!

491
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,500
Why are you here?

492
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,958
[LEO] Well, we brought
in my supervisor.

493
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,750
He got sick from eating sushi.

494
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,666
[chuckles]

495
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,166
Oh, but not me though.

496
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,958
I don't ever eat
sea creatures.

497
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,125
Yeah, my other boss.

498
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,875
It turns out that tuna
apparently was

499
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,041
his unlucky number today.

500
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,583
Wait, what does that mean?

501
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,916
You do know that tuna's
not a number, right?

502
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,416
She speaks the truth, Leo.

503
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,750
The tuna is not to
be blamed here.

504
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,458
[ZED]
I'm sure it goes without saying,

505
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,291
but Zapp is his own problem.

506
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,666
Should've had sushi
in the first place.

507
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,583
[laughs]

508
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,916
You guys're funny.

509
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,583
You must be good
friends, huh?

510
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,125
No, we are not.

511
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,791
I'll stop in and check on
him before I head home.

512
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,541
Good idea. I kinda wanna
see him writhing too.

513
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,583
It was nice meeting
you, Mr. Zed.

514
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,958
[ZED]
Right.

515
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,291
[hospital ambiance]

516
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,375
Hey, Leo.

517
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,333
I'll see you tomorrow.

518
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,583
Sure.

519
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,291
[footsteps]

520
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,333
[WHITE]
Over here.

521
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,916
Mm?

522
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,791
Are you getting bored with
the graveyard for a change?

523
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,416
I've never seen you in here.

524
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,833
[WHITE]
Well, yeah.

525
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:37,625
Most people only come here
when they need to pray.

526
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,666
So it's a little unnatural
for me to be in here.

527
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,583
[LEO]
Hmm.

528
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,291
[footsteps approaching]

529
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,416
[clothes rustle]

530
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,791
[LEO]
I get that.

531
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,291
I guess ghosts don't really
need to pray, do they?

532
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,916
[WHITE]
Huh?

533
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,291
Heh. Exactly.

534
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,666
But now,

535
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,750
I can't help but feel
I need to say a prayer.

536
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,208
[whispering] For your sake, Leo.

537
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,375
Mm?

538
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,291
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Don't lie in a church.

539
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,250
I bet you really
do wanna pray,

540
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,125
but the only person
that you're thinking about

541
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,416
praying for is you.

542
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,375
After everything
you've taken part in,

543
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,375
you can't seriously still be
hoping for salvation.

544
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,500
I swear, you humans are
chock-full of hubris.

545
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,958
Is that Black?

546
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,666
[WHITE]
The All-seeing Eyes of the Gods.

547
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,333
I want you to give them to me.

548
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,166
Give me your eyes, Leo.

549
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:13,500
[monkey-like noises]
