Moving onto our next song.

00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:14,750
This hit number was
originally released in 1967,

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,750
but has been covered in
the age of the alterworld

00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,500
by Zalmud Le Zamwell.

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,958
In any era, an eternal classic.

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,208
When you stop and take a
moment from your daily lives,

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,958
and consider the
heartfelt optimism

described by these lyrics,

00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,416
let yourself feel the
hope that maybe one day

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
the world could be filled
with a joy as refreshing

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,458
as the subject of
this timeless serenade.

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,458
As you take your lunch break,

It's been just about a month now

Watch, by the way.

I'm just a normal guy,

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,666
and by totally random chance

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,500
I became a minor member
of a major organization.

22

The organization's called Libra.

23

It's a secret society.

24
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,250
They basically keep the balance
of worlds in this weird city,

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,500
which is helpful since it's full

of monsters, beasts,
and weirder stuff.

27

They're still kind of
keeping me in the dark.

28
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,291
Just like the city,
they're shrouded in mystery.

29
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,416
I wonder just how many
people they have out there

30

working on all kinds
of missions every day.

I think we can safely assume

that Leo's probably
been abducted.

It'll lead us straight

for him to keep track of how
quickly the vehicle's moving.

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,541
[KLAUS]
Well, actually...

321
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,208
You've gotta be
pulling my damn leg.

322
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,500
If you're that
worried about him,

323
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,666
you can keep him in a high chair

324
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,916
next to you around
the clock, okay, Chief?

325
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,166
Do I look like a babysitter?

326
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,083
[KLAUS]
And, as he's one to do,

327
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,416
he refused me without
a second thought.

328
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,083
I'm afraid this
situation's all on me.

329
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,625
[STARPHASE laughs]

330
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,625
[KLAUS]
Hm?

331
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,500
[STARPHASE]
Klaus,

332
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,250
I have this self-help
book you should read

333
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,291
about winning friends
and influencing people.

334
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,791
Did you really think
Zapp, of all people,

335
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,041
would give you a straight answer

336
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,416
when asked directly to
do something like that?

337
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,791
Mr. Zapp, please, no smoking.

338
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,041
[ZAPP]
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,041
[LEO]
So that's it. I get it now.

340
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,875
For me. He did all that for me.

341
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,458
Thank you very much.
You crazy hero.

342
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,875
You tried to protect me.

343
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,166
Yeah, right.

344
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,375
Like I'm ever gonna thank
you, you stupid ass-hat!

345
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,333
We'll keep you under observation
for a few more days,

346
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,291
and then you're out.

347
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,625
Congratulations.

348
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,666
Oh, sweet.

349
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,916
What the hell is this?

350
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,583
A cemetery? At a hospital?

351
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,666
Well, that's morbid.

352
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,166
[GIRL giggling]

353
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
[GIRL]
You're right.

354
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,083
I'm pretty sure that's why
nobody else comes here but me.

355
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,041
But then, isn't it futile
to live in fear of death?

356
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,583
Don't you think? I mean,

357
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,541
everyone's gonna
die at some point,

358
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,833
so might as well make
peace with it instead of

359
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,833
pretending it's
not gonna happen.

360
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,375
Or maybe...

361
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,791
some people think there's
no reason to worry about death

362
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,625
'cause they're convinced
they're gonna live forever,

363
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,666
right?

364
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,458
Mister Leonardo Watch,

365
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,416
which of those
camps do you fall in?

366
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,500
[LEO]
Who the hell is this girl?

367
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,750
[giggles]

368
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,583
You can just call me White!

369
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,208
I'm a ghost!

370
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,250
Let's be friends, Leonardo!

371
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,333
Very best friends!

372
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,541
[YAHABIO]
I am Yahabio,

373
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,000
humble courier, at your service.

374
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,458
Today, I've ended up delivering
the next episode preview.

375
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,083
I'm sure there are
some of you out there

376
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,541
who are wondering, "Why are
we listening to a character

377
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,791
who already died during
the episode I just watched?"

378
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:27,250
Don't sweat such petty
stuff, man. It'll kill you.

379
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,625
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront":

380
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,583
A Game Between Two Worlds!

381
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,208
The upshot is this.

382
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,125
Whoever wins is the victor!

383
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,000
But what do I know? I'm dead.
