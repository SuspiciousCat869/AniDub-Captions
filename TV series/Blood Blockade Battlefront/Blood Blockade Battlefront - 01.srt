Hello, Michella.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,458
How are you?
I'm finally doing well.

3
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,458
Can you believe it's been
half a year now

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,333
since your big brother
came to this city?

5
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,416
These last six months
have felt incredibly long,

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,583
yet they've still gone by
really quickly.

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,041
And that feels as weird
as it sounds.

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,250
I feel a bit awkward
writing you after all this time,

9
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,833
and I'm guessing
it's kind of a surprise for you.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,583
Don't worry, nothing bad
has happened.

11
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,958
It's just...
I've got some things

12
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,125
I need to say, and you're
the one person

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,625
that I'd want
to share them with.

14
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,916
And that's all there is to it.

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,458
This place is as crowded
and messy as it's always been.

16
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,875
A noisy city,
where abnormal is normal.

17
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,041
I've managed to muddle
through up until now,

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,041
living out both the worst
and the best days of my life.

19
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:13,708
A year ago,
before I left you behind,

20
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,958
I saw myself as worthless.

21
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,291
Someone who was insignificant

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,291
to the grand scheme
of the world.

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,000
Just another powerless,
idealistic little man

24
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,083
that you can find on any street
in any city.

25
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,541
My feelings haven't changed much
since then.

26
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,458
But every once in a while,
I get a faint glimmer

27
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,166
that those feelings
aren't true.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,833
And today, I want to tell you
all of the reasons

29
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,666
why I've begun
to think differently.

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,791
I want to tell you
about what I've seen,

31
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,208
what I've felt,
and above all else,

32
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,583
about the people
that I've met in this city.

33
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,416
This might turn out
to be a long letter,

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,708
but I hope you'll bear with me
and read it to the end.

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,250
This is my story, and the story
of the people in my life,

36
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,791
and how they've given me hope.

37
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,791
[LEO]
This city really is the pits.

38
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,166
[NARRATOR]
The world as we knew it

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,166
changed in the course
of a single eventful night!

40
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,125
[LEO]
Get back here, monkey!

41
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,333
[NARRATOR]
And the arcane city

42
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,791
of Hellsalem's Lot
arose from that historic

43
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,750
juncture of events!

44
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,083
[LEO]
It's a melting pot

45
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,750
where the main ingredients
are fight-picking

46
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,833
and wallet-lifting.
The wages are lower than dirt,

47
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:44,791
and it's almost impossible

48
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,083
to make any friends.

49
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,500
[NARRATOR]
Just three years ago,

50
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,166
New York City stood
in this very spot!

51
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,666
[LEO]
Life is hard enough on its own.

52
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,041
But trust me,
it's even harder here.

53
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,500
[NARRATOR]
On that one fateful night,

54
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,916
the gate to beyond opened,

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,833
the alterworld
swallowed New York City,

56
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,958
Hellsalem's Lot
was reconstructed

57
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,875
in its place,
and the barrier of fog

58
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,250
shrouded the entire island!

59
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Isn't that right,
Mr. Guabara?

60
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes!

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,583
[crying]

62
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,708
[LEO] And life's that much
harder for a nobody like me.

63
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,333
My only redeeming feature
being that I'm normal.

64
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,958
[NARRATOR]
It was already too late

65
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,916
for the American government
to intervene.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
By the time they arrived,
the city was lost

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,375
behind the impenetrable fog.

68
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,333
Isn't that correct,
Mr. Guabara?

69
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,458
[GUABARA]
Yes!

70
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,958
[LEO]
Once you get used to it,

71
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,916
the abnormal
starts to feel normal.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,333

[voices speeded up]

74
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,500
[NARRATOR] As a result
of the Great Collapse,

75
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,666
we were given conclusive

76
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,916
firsthand exposure

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,791
to an alternate dimension,
a theory long held

78
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,291
to be nothing more
than the stuff

79
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,750
of science fiction.

80
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,000
Although we are now aware
of its existence,

81
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,750
we don't really know
much else about it.

82
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,000
Isn't that so, Mr. Guabara?

83
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,666
Yes!

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,750

So yeah, life is hard.

00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,791
Three weeks after my arrival,
I was barely getting by.

[CROWD screams]

[NARRATOR]
It's still yet to be seen

00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,208
whether this encounter
proves to be a comedy

or a tragedy for both
our worlds.

90
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,583
I guess that knowledge
is something

about ready to give up.

My general lack of luck
and the absurdity of this city

96
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,041
had taken their toll.

You know, the guy
you were supposed to meet?

102
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,541
But I guess you were too busy
with nearly getting killed

00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,000
in the middle of the street
to show up at the checkpoint.

Well... you could say
it's for work.

'Cause it looks like

You're a weird guy.

I was normal.

You do realize we don't
offer free coffee refills

00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,416
as an alternative to actually
ordering our food, right?

I would if I could.

But I-- No, I
couldn't. I mean--

148

I don't deserve it.

Oh, come on, don't
give me all that.

Feeling sorry for yourself
ain't the same thing

as being humble.

And besides... we still need
your daily coffee money

478
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,000
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront":

479
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,958
After the Phantom Ghost Wagon.

480
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,833
Go on and watch it for yourself
if you don't believe me.

481
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,916
Best of luck to you
all next time,

482
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,625
you sniveling human swine!
