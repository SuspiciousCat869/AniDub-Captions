1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,791
[WHITE] I'm lucky enough to have
a family that I love very much.

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,416
Benjamin Macbeth.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,166
Emma Macbeth.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,750
William Macbeth.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,833
They all have it.

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,333
[dinging]

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,875
Mary Macbeth.

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:22,791
[buzzer]

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,875
She does not have it.

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,541
The one and only blemish
in the Macbeth family tree?

11
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,416
[splatter]

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,375
Well, that would be me.

13
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,750
[WHITE] It goes back
for generations.

14
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,083
Everyone in my family has been
born with psychic powers.

15
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,333
As a result, they've
all become casters,

16
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,541
a group of people
who use their powers

17
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,875
to help the world.

18
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,250
So it's a long-standing
tradition on both sides

19
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,916
of our family
to become a caster.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
Which means I should be
a first-class thoroughbred,

21
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,291
and makes me even more
of a disappointment.

22
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,833
[crying]

23
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,416
[WHITE]
Trust me on this one.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,083
Being born an average kid into
a household of special people

25
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,208
with special powers
is miserable.

26
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,583
Nothing else to call it
but terrible luck.

27
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,500
[grunts]

28
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,875
[WHITE] I put myself on
trial on a daily basis.

29
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,958
[bleating]

30
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,583
[YOUNG WHITE]
Miss Mary Macbeth!

31
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,500
Guilty!

32
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,541
[WHITE]
However.

33
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,333
[BEN]
Objection, your honor!

34
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,208
We find the
defendant innocent.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,208
[bleating]

36
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,333
[WHITE]
I've got these parents.

37
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,833
On what grounds, exactly?

38
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,541
Do we have to spell it out?

39
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,625
You came into this world as
our one and only little girl.

40
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,875
Could there possibly be any
better grounds than that?

41
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,750
Not that I know of. That's
more than enough reason.

42
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,041
[EMMA] Oh, look at
those beautiful eyes.

43
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,708
They look just like emeralds.

44
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,458
[BEN]
Our priceless little treasure.

45
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,708
I wish. But they
really mean it.

46
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,791
Trying to make me
feel good about myself

47
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,250
only made me
feel even worse.

48
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,416
[EMMA]
You're so cute!

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,291
[WHITE] It's like
their unconditional love

50
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,583
just pointed out how
different I really was.

51
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,208
[EMMA]
You're so cute!

52
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,875
[WHITE]
Another reminder?

53
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,791
[crying]

54
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,458
[WHITE]
My older brother.

55
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,791
Not fair! He took it!
He took it from me!

56
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,666
[rumbling]

57
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,250
[dog barking]

58
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,708
Hey, Dad! Will's crying again!

59
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,125
[crying]

60
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,958
--[BULLY 1] C'mere, Wuss!
--[BULLY 2] Yeah, wussy!

61
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,666
[WHITE] My twin brother, born
just a few minutes ahead of me,

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,458
possessed enough power
for the both of us.

63
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,208
[BULLIES laughing]

64
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,541
[WHITE] All of the casters
had high expectations

65
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,125
of him, as well.

66
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,333
And yet,

67
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,083
for reasons I don't understand,

68
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,500
he refused to ever
use his power.

69
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,791
[laughs weakly]

70
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,750
[YOUNG WHITE] Why don't you
ever try to fight back, Will?

71
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,541
There's just no reason
for you to always

72
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,000
get your butt kicked, right?

73
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,291
[YOUNG BLACK]
I dunno.

74
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,708
[YOUNG WHITE]
Putting up with it is like

75
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,208
inviting them to
beat you up again.

76
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,125
[YOUNG BLACK]
Uh.

77
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,583
I know you're right, but
I'm not any good at fighting.

78
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,833
[frustrated grunt]

79
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,041
You don't have to use
your fists, you dummy!

80
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,541
Hmm?

81
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,416
Psychic powers!

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,041
Uh.

83
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,958
You're sitting on a gold mine
and you won't even look down!

84
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,208
Ugh. Yeah, I'm sorry.

85
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,208
What are you apologizing for?

86
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,083
Huh?

87
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,875
I don't want you to apologize!

88
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,208
Just use them!

89
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
That's what I want, okay?

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,208
Oh, sorry.

91
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,541
[sighs]

92
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,375
[birds chirping]

93
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,916
Forget it.

94
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,500
Get beat up. It's your life.

95
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,166
[YOUNG BLACK]
Mary!

96
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,750
Hey, um.

97
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,708
Thank you.

98
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,375
Huh?

99
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,666
It's just that, I try not to,
but I always get scared.

100
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,708
I envy you, Mary.
I'm not strong like you are.

101
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,541
Don't be a smart aleck.

102
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,708
Eh?

103
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,500
[WHITE] What does
he mean he gets scared?

104
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,833
The truth is that having
psychic powers isn't

105
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,500
as great as it seems.

106
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,125
Using them causes fatigue.

107
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,291
And if you're reckless,

108
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,291
it can even
shorten your life.

109
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,625
[grunting]

110
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,833
[splat]

[AUDIENCE gasps]

112
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,583
Scanning is exhausting.

113
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,041
Such a pain.

114
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,791
[WHITE] Maybe that's what
my brother's scared of.

115
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,458
Taking years off of his life.

116
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,625
Or maybe not.

117
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
Maybe he's just a wimp.

118
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,416
No, your brother's not a wimp.

119
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,291
And don't you worry about him.

120
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,375
Will's stronger than
he seems, he'll be fine.

121
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,875
I'm not worried. He can
be a wuss if he wants.

122
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,166
You and your mom can
be so ruthless some ti--

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,333
Uh, I meant strong-willed, so

124
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,791
he may come across
that way to you.

125

[bleating]

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,708
[BEN] Choosing not to use
the easiest option available?

127
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,208
Well, that strikes me as
an incredibly brave decision.

128
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,291
And, it's all up to him.

129
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,625
There's no reason for him to
force himself to be a caster.

130
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,500
Why should we make him do
something he doesn't want to?

131
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,166
[YOUNG WHITE grunting]

132
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,416
If he's thought it through
and that's what he's decided,

133
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,916
well, then, we have
to respect that.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Not to mention.

135
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,125
Did you forget about
what happened?

136
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,750
The reason Will doesn't
want to use his powers now?

Hmm?

138
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,083
I guess I did.

139
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,291
Really?

140
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,000
It was a pretty big
deal at the time.

141
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,458
Caused quite the commotion.

142
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,500
Hey, Will.

143
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,708
C'mere, you gotta hear this.

144
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,041
Mary just told me
that she-- [grunts]

145

[YOUNG WHITE] Don't listen
to him, it's not important!

146
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,458
Hmm?

147
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,416
[YOUNG WHITE]
He can't be serious about

148
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,916
not being a caster.

[BOTH laughing]

150
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,375
[WHITE] My parents were
usually boring and normal.

00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,208
[BOTH]
Bye.

152
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,250
[WHITE] So it made me really
proud whenever they'd go off

153
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,083
to save the world
from whatever danger.

154
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,500
But more than that,

155
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,666
I was downright
envious of them.

156
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,958
Getting to use their gifts
as weapons and risking

157
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,166
their lives for
the greater good.

158
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,291
Whether they've got
psychic powers or not,

159
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,458
everyone dies at some point.

160
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,375
Considering that, you have
to put some serious thought

161
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,833
into what you want to
accomplish before you croak.

162
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,000
Particularly if you're
nothing special.

163
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,791
There's gotta be something.

Cheese!

00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,875
[EMMA] Where in the world
did you find that old camera?

167
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,666
[YOUNG WHITE]
In the closet.

168
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Can I keep it?

169
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,875
Sure, why not?

170
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,916
It's your father's.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,458
Do you like it?

172
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,125
Mm-hmm.

173
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, I should get dinner
started before it gets too late.

You sure have taken a lot, huh?

176
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,041
[YOUNG WHITE]
Mm-hmm.

177
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,916
[BEN] Aren't there
any pictures of you?

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,083
[YOUNG WHITE]
Mm-mm.

179
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,583
That's not what this is about.

180
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,708
[WHITE]
Honestly?

181
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,166
It's not like I had a passion
for photography or anything.

What is it about then?

184
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,166
[WHITE] It's just that if
I were to suddenly die

185
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
in the next instant.

186
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,333
At least the last thing I'd
seen would remain behind.

[camera clicks]

And I thought that was nice.

00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,041
That there'd still be
something left of me.

you've got there.

[BULLY 2]
Yeah, we like it!

195
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,000
You wouldn't have a problem
with us borrowing it, right?

196
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,083
Yeah, hand it over!

197
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,333
Sure, why not.

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,750
Now give it back!

Are you serious?

[BULLY 1] Calm down,
your sister's the one who

204
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,208
said we could use it.

205
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
Even so, I want it back!

206
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,416

Mary.

Why's your head on my chest?

215
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just making sure
you're still alive.

Oh, okay.

She's on the phone.

00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,375
[YOUNG WHITE] Why would you
jump into the river like that?

220
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,875
[YOUNG BLACK]
Those guys threw your camera

221
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,000
and I was trying to catch it.

222
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,958
I guess I blew it
though, huh?

223
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,875
I'm sorry.

224
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,625
I know how much you liked it.

225
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,958
[YOUNG WHITE] You know that you
could have died if those jerks

226
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,375
hadn't pulled you
out of there, right?

227
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,625
Oh, yeah?

228
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,958
I guess it was dangerous, huh?

229
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,875
I'll have to thank
them for that.

230
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,125
[YOUNG WHITE]
What is wrong with you?

231
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,041
Why are you acting like this
happened to someone else?

232
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,833
You're so stupid,
Will, I hate you!

233
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,041
You've always got that dumb
look on your face like

234
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,916
you don't know what's going on.

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,750
I don't care about the camera!

236
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,958
The pictures were just
a dumb distraction!

237
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,833
You must've been given your
power for a reason, right?

238
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,833
So use it.

239
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,958
Or whatever else you can.

240
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,708
Just do something
to protect yourself!

If you had died, Will.

drowned in the river.

Why are you guys wailing?

251
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,791
[YOUNG BLACK]
I was just thinking.

252
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,541
Do you remember when I broke
that mudball you made?

253
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,500
It was back when we
were really little.

254
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,333
It was such a well-made
and perfectly round ball.

255
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,666
And you seemed
so proud of it.

256
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,041
I think you showed it to me
hoping I would tell you

257
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,041
that you did a good job.

258
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,666
But it just made me frustrated.

259
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,833
So I couldn't help
but make it explode.

260
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,708
Talk about childish.

261
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,291
Well, yeah. We were
just children at the time.

262
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,291
When I did it,

263
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,250
I was sure it was
gonna make you cry.

264
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,625
But you didn't.

265
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,625
You just stood there in a daze.

266
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,666
And then you got started making
another ball, right away.

267
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,833
I got so embarrassed
with myself.

268
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,708
It felt like you
were outgrowing me.

269
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,708
Leaving me behind.

270
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,916
And it made me scared that
I couldn't control myself.

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,416
Scared of my powers.

272
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,625
So right then,

273
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,791
I made a promise to myself.

274
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,708
That until I became
as strong as you are,

275
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,208
I would keep myself from
using my psi powers.

Okay. That wasn't the huge
commotion, was it?

278
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,833
Huh?

279
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,166

kind of big deal that happened.

280

Oh.

281
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,958
Well, I did start
crying afterwards.

Don't act like your
pictures aren't important.

You took those photos
'cuz you enjoyed it.

You made me wanna
try taking one, too.

But I'm terrible at it!

You're right, I
shouldn't have done it!

300
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,916
It wasn't fair of me to take
your picture while you

were sleeping like that!

[YOUNG WHITE] Still, if you
are gonna be a caster,

it's time for you to
quit slacking off

and start practicing.

to get nervous about
what you're gonna do, Will.

[YOUNG WHITE]
And besides,

339
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,125
Mom said
something one time.

340
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,333
She told me it
doesn't matter if a caster

341
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,541
is good at fighting
or if they're strong.

342
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,291
That's not what
they actually need.

[YOUNG BLACK]
Oh, yeah?

But that's the only way!

If you need hands.

Then take what
you need from me!

352
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,125
[YOUNG WHITE] The one thing
that a caster really needs.

353
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,750
It's something that you've had
as long as I've known you, Will.

I don't want to do
this to you, but.

360
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,000
I have to get Will back.

361
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,291
And the only way
that I can do that.

362
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Is for me to do what he wants.

[whistling continues]

00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,625
[KING OF DESPAIR]
You are absolutely correct

372
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,083
about one thing,
my dear sister.

373
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,625
Sooner or later,
everyone is bound to die.

374
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,041
Death!

375
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,250
Oh, death!

376
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,666
How ephemeral a thing.

377
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,875
So brief and defined.

378
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,125
This terminal
predestination of man.

379
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,666
However, I don't see
it as a tragedy.

380
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,500
Death is the ultimate
privilege of the living.

381
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,583
To exist beyond reason.

382
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,666
Roving lost and listless within
the confines of infinity.

383
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,166
Yes, be grateful for
your fleeting nature.

384
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,125
It's impossible for one to live
and forget about death.

385
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,083
The despair that is my being.

386
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,125
Conversely forgotten
by death itself.

387
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,250
There are few things
for me to embrace.

388
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,875
Only sleep,

389
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:18,416

There's a barrier

It's the only thing
keeping her alive.

420

Nothing more than a
desperate last-ditch attempt

by her parents to keep
the feeble little brat
