[LEO]
Ever since that fateful day,

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,541
I've been plagued
with these dreams.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,208
Unshakable terror.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,041
Constant anxiety.

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,541
Days filled with remorse.

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,750
They bleed over into my sleep.

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
I struggle to stand still,

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,083
praying for it to pass,

9
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,333
and then wake up

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,583
in the same place
as the day before.

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,583
With the same lack of answers.

12
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,458
And I realize I'm awake, but
I'm still in the bad dream.

13
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,083
[WHITE]
I had the most peaceful dream.

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,208
It was about my childhood.

15
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,333
Days filled with gentleness.

16
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,083
It was more memory than dream.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,791
And it was so vivid.

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,000
So many years have passed
between now and then.

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,333
But I'll never allow those
memories to be forgotten.

20
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,791
Even though I know
it's only a dream.

21
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,000
Because this is
my reality now.

22
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,375
And there's nothing I can
do to change that fact.

23
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,666
[LEO] The loneliness
I've wrestled with,

24
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,208
the courage I've found,

25
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,458
the joy I've experienced,

26
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,666
the nearly-impossible-to-
shake hatred and sadness.

27
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,291
If I'm to face this
reality closing in on me,

28
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,208
what will it cost me?

29
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,583
What will I be left with?

30
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:35,458
Welcome home! You've finally
reached the end of your life!

31
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,750
Didn't know that death
was a place, did you?

32
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,875
Speak up, my cute
little corpse!

33

Well look at that!
You are alive, aren't you?

36
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,208
Don't lie to me!

37
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,916
[LEO]
I'm dead, dammit!

38
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,750
What will I lose?
And what can I do about it?

39

[NOMONAI] This fog is
downright impenetrable,

Yes!

[NOMONAI] Do you think
that this young man

47
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,708
calling himself the King
of Despair is correct?

48

Could we truly be in the initial
stages of the Second Collapse?

there adding to the fog?

[ZED] We're supposed
to be looking for Leo.

[STARPHASE]
Klaus!

59
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,833
Just heard from LHOS.

60
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,333
They're getting ready to
repair the destroyed barrier,

61
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,333
but they can't initiate until
the other casters arrive.

62
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,416
They made a formal
request for our assistance.

63
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,208
The final caster's gone missing
and they need him found.

64
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,291
Has it already
been three years?

65
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,291
Or has it only
been three years?

66
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,458
Either way, looks like
we get to stare into

67
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,000
the blinding
white darkness again.

--Pipe down.
--[BRODY laughs]

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,333
Have a little class, Deldro.

74
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,708
I don't get how you can be so
sure that Leo's still alright.

75
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,041
You saw the same
video I did, right?

76
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,000
[PATRICK] With that
creepy little Despair dweeb

77
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,583
perched over his body?

78
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,208
Seems like bad news for Leo once
that kid's finished with him.

79
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,458
No. Just trust me.
I know that he's fine.

80
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:52,291
For starters, the gravitational
changes haven't begun yet.

81
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,333
We knew things had taken a turn
for the worse three years ago

82
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,958
when the Eternal Hollow opened
up beneath the whole city.

83
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,000
So the last barrier's
still intact.

84
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,375
--It's barely holding on!
--[ANGELICA] Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,083
[ELDER]
We believe that we've pinpointed

86
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,541
that last damaged barrier,

87
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,708
and if we're correct,
it's Mary Macbeth.

88
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,791
The girl just might be
a living, breathing barrier.

89
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,250
Is something like
that even possible?

90
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,583
[ELDER]
Mm.

91
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,333
Depending on their
caster's style,

92
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,416
barriers can come in all forms.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
And the same goes for
their source of energy.

94
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,416
There's no precedent to state
that weaving a barrier

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,625
from a living being
is impossible.

96
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
Though it would be taboo.

97
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,500
My assumption is
that Mary's parents

98
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,291
must've performed this
shortly before their

99
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,250
deaths during
the Great Collapse.

100
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,208
Which would mean that Mary has
spent the last three years

101
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,583
as a buttress supporting
our dimension.

102
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:46,125
If this hypothesis is correct,
and I'm almost certain it is,

103
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,416
then it's imperative
that we find this girl.

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,708
And we better hope
that she's still alive.

110
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,625
Is the fog hampering
me somehow?

111
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,750
I feel so exhausted.

112

But the ghost.

113
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,666
I've gotta make sure
they don't find her.

Damn it.

So sleepy.

116
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,250
If we assume the King of
Despair is using Leo's eyes

117
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,208
to locate the last barrier--

Listen.

I know that you think
you're trying to save Will

But it's not like I forced
him to accept me.

Not one bit.

658
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,875
That was entirely his choice.

He had the exact same

[KING OF DESPAIR]
So what's your plan then?

674
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
Don't tell me that you're
actually thinking of using

to kill me.

[LEO]
I don't know.

677

Killing you is probably
the best thing to do.

678

But I still can't decide.

'Cause I'm not sure if
it's the right thing to do,

And that's why

I'm just gonna keep
mulling it over

figured out by then.

through the wringer earlier,

00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,708

How are you?

I'm finally doing well.

I'm writing this letter
to tell you that

I'm standing on
my own two feet at last.

I hope this won't upset you,

won't hold it against me.

I still depend on your light,
