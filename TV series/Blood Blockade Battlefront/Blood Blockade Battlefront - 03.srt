The infinite complexity of it

162
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,875
makes it a staggering
work of art.

163
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,041
The game has intrigued me
as deeply as chess.

164
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,583
Although my study of
Prosfair cannot equal

165
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,166
my lifelong
devotion to chess,

166
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,500
it's more than adequate.

I'm prepared for this day!

168
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,125
One moment, please!

00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:45,875
I must ask you... Do you intend
to play two games today?

170
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,166
Why, of course, Klaus.

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,416
Humanity needs Mr. Ulchenko.

172
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,208
His brilliant mind
is one of mankind's

173
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,375
greatest assets.

174

To potentially lose his genius

175
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,833
would be a loss
for our whole world.

176
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,791
I ask that you
please reconsider.

177
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,500
Excuse me... I'd rather
you not speak for me

178

I appreciate your
concern, but I'm aware

of the stakes at hand.

Now please refrain from
overstepping your bounds.

And by the way, what makes you

With all humility,
I can assure you of this...

there is no other human
more qualified and experienced

Huh. Then you're advising

If all he wants
is to play a game,

the fool would be better
off at a cafe in Paris.

[ULCHENKO]
I'd like for my country

209
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,125
[ARLELELLE]
I place the value

of that request
at a nine-hour game.

211

If you can hold out
for the duration

or force a draw, let
alone get me to resign,

No disrespect, Klausie,

You've walked out of there

[KLAUS]
You don't get it.

I never walked out of
there because I won.

One more thing...

No one can know

They could cause quite
a bit of trouble for me.

Hmm... Klaus is not the type

out of there by the skin

[ARLELELLE] However, I
will grant your request.

In exchange, though, we

to 10 hours.

As for your wager,
if you lose the game

The more skilled you are,

the more complex Prosfair
grows in its intricacies.

On top of that,
the more time passes,

advising him to forgo
pursuing checkmate,

was the only method
that's kept me alive.

entertain me that long,

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,708
I'll grant your request.

00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,291
of the next 36 hours.

320
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,000
Careful now...
don't break, Klaus.

321
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,708
I understand.

322
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,166
Don't hold back. I'll give
it everything I've got.

323
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,666
[ARLELELLE]
There is no denying

324
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,291
that he's an interesting man.

325
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,583
He put his own life on the table

326
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,416
in order to protect
the other one,

327
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,916
without even slightest
bit of hesitation.

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,875
And the information that
he seeks on his own behalf

329
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,833
is of such
monolithic significance

330
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,875
that it could
definitively reconstruct

331
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,750
the fate of his entire world.

332
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,583
So, why? Why does he
pile on further risk

333
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,166
with such casual abandon?

334
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,958
It's wholly irrational.

335
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:56,166
These humans... I'll
never understand them.

336
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,208
Have you come to
regret your decision?

337
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,208
Not in the least.

338
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,958
And how is that?

339
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,041
All I can say is, I've
made up my mind not to.

340
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,125
--Hmm.
--I've thought it through,

341
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,875
and I'm content with it.

342
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,958
Hmm.

343
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,958
Listen, Klaus... in the
fairness of full disclosure,

344
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,500
I think you should know
that this Ulchenko fellow

345
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,875
you're risking your very
life to rescue...

346
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,666
well, in our previous game,

347
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,041
and without even the courtesy

348
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,750
of at least feigning
some hesitation,

349
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,791
he requested that I
have you eliminated.

350
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,583
So you must see the irony here.

351
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,291
Tell me. This man...

352
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,750
is he worth the pain
you've put yourself through?

353
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,166
Do you genuinely
find his existence

354
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,791
to be worthy of salvation?

355
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,791
[KLAUS]
Humans are weak.

356
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,125
Because of that weakness,
they can act selfishly

357
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,666
and let fear guide
their decisions.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,125
But... why should I let
the way they live

359
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,333
affect my choices?

360
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:27,333
You see? Even if I'm struck
with a thousand setbacks,

361
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:32,875
nothing will ever convince me
to alter the way I live...

362
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,333
...my life!

363
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,916
[KK]
Klaus!

364
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,166
[ARLELELLE]
As per our deal,

365
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,666
I will give you the source
behind Angel Scale.

366
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,250
And as for you, Ulchenko,
you are entirely free to go.

367
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,166
[KK]
Start raiding the locations

368
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,333
I'm about to give you!

369
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,958
Hit the scum with
everything you've got

370
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,875
before they catch on!

371
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,125
Got it?

372
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,500
And if any of our men fail,

373
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,000
you tell them
I'll personally kill

374
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,708
every last one of them!

375
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,250
[LEO] As for wherever Klaus
got that kind of information,

376
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,541
the truth is, none of us know
how he pulled that one off.

377
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,375
Just on a whim,
I happened to ask

378
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,625
if it had anything
to do with that game,

379
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,625
but as usual, they hardly even
acknowledged I was there.

380
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,750
Hey, ya never know.

381
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,708
Anything can happen
in this world.

382
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,791
[LEO] Anything can
happen in this world.

383
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:43,625
[WHITE and LEO laughing]

384
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,416
[LEO]
For example...

385
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,083
even a normal dufus like me

386
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,708
can become friends
with a cute girl.

387
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,958
--What?
--Uhh? Nothing.

388
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,500
Do you really like those?

389
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,875
It's not like I shot
anything that great.

390
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,666
Are you serious?
These are awesome.

391
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,833
I've been locked in here
for three whole years now,

392
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,666
so this is almost as
good as getting out.

393
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,625
And I'm just glad
I've got someone

394
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,625
other than my
brother to talk to.

395
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,750
Sure, I got ya.

396
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,125

Huh?

397
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,625
--[LEO] Huh?
--Hmm?

398
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,375
Nothing.

They're great pictures.

You think so? Thanks.

401
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,833
I'll bet you've got
pretty sharp eyesight.

402
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,083
Actually, better than
20/10 in both eyes.

403
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:36,958
I knew it!

404
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,250
[BLACK] If you wish to know
where your enemy is,

405
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,416
look no further than
within yourself.

406
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,791
I bet some people
actually believe that.

407
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,416
But it's not true.

408
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,750
The enemy always comes
at you from without.

409
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,708
Trust me on this,
never let your guard down.

410
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,375
The person you'll least
expect will find you today,

411
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,666
and they will
try to harm you.

412

Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront..."

Blood Line Fever.

414
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,208
It's far too late
for introductions, brother.

415
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,625
And besides, you already
know my name, don't you?
