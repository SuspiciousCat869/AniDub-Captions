00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:12,666
[DJ FANGO] You're listening
to WHL Mist Stream.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,375
Coming up next is our live
listener advice program.

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,083
In this world of ours where
strange is the new normal,

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,875
we might be given a peak
or two, but naturally,

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,250
they're surrounded by valleys.

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,166
The old sentiment
"love your enemy"

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,083
comes across as quaint
at best these days.

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,375
And in this city,

10
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,000
the people who
preach that proverb

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,958
are typically
the first to die.

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,083
For those of you barely clinging
to the edge of this world,

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,375
hang in there.

14

"I just wish someone
would bother to listen to me.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,791
If I only had
the chance to get my

16
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,708
problems off my chest."

17
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,333
If that's how you feel,

18
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,458
DJ Fango is here for you.

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,791
Which brings us to
our first lost-in-the-Lot

20
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,375
and concerned caller.

21
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,750
On the line with us now,
we have the pseudonymous

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,750
"The Tragedy of L."

23
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:58,833
Hello!

24
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,041
[LEO]
Uh!

25
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,875
He-Hel-Hello!

26
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,916
[DJ FANGO] So let's start
with a little about you,

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,333
The Tragedy of L.

28
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,458
Tell me what you do.

29
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,583
Are you a student?

30
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,708
[LEO]
Huh? Uh.

31
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,083
No, I don't!
Um, I mean, I'm not,

32
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,625
uh, student-ing.

33
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,625
I'm... uh... I-- I--

34
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,333
I'm an office,
I mean, worker,

35
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,708
I work in an office!

[hyperventilating]

37
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,375
[DJ FANGO]
Hey, you're doing fine.

38
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,125
It's okay, breathe now.

39
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,583
Just breathe.

[train rattles by]

41
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,250
[DJ FANGO] Well, how
about we jump right in?

42
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,458
What's troubling you today?

43
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,791
[LEO]
Ah, er, um,

44
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,041
th-th-there's so much.

45
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,125
To be honest, I'm not even
sure where to begin, really.

46
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:40,375
S-So much has happened,
y'know? I mean.

47
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,458
Since I moved to the city.

[DJ FANGO]
Oh, I believe it.

50
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,208
Anything can happen
in this world, huh?

51
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,458
[grunts]

52
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,458
[LEO] I've encountered
a lot of strange people.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,791
And managed to get into
some super-freaky situations.

54
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,541
[screaming]

55
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,833
[LEO] But I've also met
some really incredible folks.

56
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,916
[DJ FANGO]
Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,458
[LEO]
And I wasn't expecting that.

58
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,458
[DJ FANGO] That's just some of
that "anything can happen."

59
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,208
[LEO] So I guess the
thing I'm worried about--

60
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,333
[DJ FANGO] Looks like it's time
for our first song of the day.

61
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,791
[LEO]
Huh?

62
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,625
[DJ FANGO] Here's Bump of
Chicken with "Hello, world!"

63
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:24,666
[LEO]

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:34,708

72
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,375
[DJ FANGO]
And we're back.

73
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,541
If you're just tuning in,

74
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,791
we have The Tragedy
of L on the line.

75
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,375
We took the chance
to speak just now

76
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,000
during the song,
and in short,

77
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,583
The Tragedy of L is a rather
anxious young man

78
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,000
who's been beleaguered
by the routine vagaries

79
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,958
of our odd city
since moving here.

80
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,333
How long have you
been here now?

81
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,208
[LEO]
How, um, long?

82
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,208

Le-Let's see.
Um, how, how long.

84
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,833
Um, well. That's a good--

You're okay.

Breathe now, just breathe.

[train rattling by]

90
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,000
[DJ FANGO]
So I think we can agree.

91
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,250
This city is at the top of the
scale on the unique meter.

92
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,458
It's as difficult to
explain as it is to believe.

93
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,375
But the metaphysical metropolis
we call Hellsalem's Lot

94
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,583
was recently known
as New York City.

95
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,500
Only three years have passed
since the disastrous anomaly

96
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,458
labeled as the
Great Collapse occurred.

97
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,041
The phenomenon opened up
an interdimensional sinkhole,

98
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,250
if you will, a portal
colliding our world

99
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,833
with the alterworld beyond.

100
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,875
The entire island was
shrouded in a barrier of fog.

101
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,875
And it all happened
in a single night.

102
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,458
To say the least,
no one really knew--

103
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,000
[LEO] Yep. That's the
city I call home.

104
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
The crossroads of
weird and weirder,

105
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,208
Hellsalem's Lot.

106
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,791
And toiling in the shadows to
preserve the fractured balance

107
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,000
between these worlds is
the secret society of Libra.

108
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,000
Although it's spoken of like
it's some kind of urban legend,

109
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
it is very real.

110
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,916
It's just veiled in secrecy.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,250
[KLAUS]
Welcome.

112
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,333
You must be our new colleague.

113
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,250
Glad to have you on board.

114
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,166
[LEO] I was taken to
their headquarters one day

115
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,708
due to a misunderstanding.

116
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,458
But the crazy thing is that
I was invited to stay on

117
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,958
and become a member.

118
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,875
[DJ FANGO] There's no doubt
these past few years have--

119
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,166
[LEO]
Oh. Just to be clear,

120
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,208
all of this is off the
record, of course.

121
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,958
[DJ FANGO] But, here we are
in this fog-enshrouded city.

122

Natives of the human world
and the alterworld

00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,000
Of course,

125
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,541
It does tend to make
for a fairly precarious

126
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,083
living situation most days.

routine violence
and everyday disasters,

130
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,208
it all plays out
like background music.

131
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,375
But, hey,

132
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,208
if you're looking to
alleviate boredom,

133
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,458
you've found the place.

134
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,791
[LEO] Yeah. Every day
brings a new dose of

135
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,083
random insanity.

136
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
It gets a little
rough some days.

137
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,916
But I've had my share
of happy times as well.

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,291
[DJ FANGO] You said
that you've met some

you're very lucky in that area.

It's pretty rare that we
happen to hear from someone

on this program who actually
likes their work superior.

00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,666
He's terrible!

162
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,458
I'm not sure if he's
the worst human being ever.

163
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,250
Zapp, give it back!

164

[ZAPP]
Ah.

165
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,208
You gotta pay for it, man!
Just give it back to me!

166
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,416
Or if he's the greatest
scum-sucking dirtbag ever.

[grunts]

169
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:23,125
[LEO] I mean, I guess he does
have a few good aspects to him.

170
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,541
[ZAPP] Underestimate me at
your own peril, ya big bitch.

172

[LEO]
No, I'm wrong. He doesn't.

173

--He is an awful supervisor.

[DJ FANGO]
Uh-huh.

175
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:36,583
So the dark abyss you're peering
into sounds pretty deep indeed.

176
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,583
Is there anyone in the workplace
you can talk to about

177
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,000
his behavior?

178
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,583
[LEO]
Yeah. [laughs]

179
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,875
There's not much I
could really say to them.

180
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,916
We all agree that
he's a terrible person.

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,250
And, uh,

182
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,041
everyone else there is
a little strange as well.

183
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,708
Y'know, make that
exceptionally strange.

184
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,333
[DJ FANGO] It does sound
like a rather unusual place.

185
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,583
Listening to you explain it,
though, I get the feeling

186
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,375
it's a fun place to work.

187
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,708
But work is work, so I'm sure
there are trying times.

188
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,791
[LEO]
Eh?

189
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,083
[DJ FANGO]
So these highly eccentric,

190
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
but incredible
folks of yours,

191
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,458
they certainly sound
like good people to

192
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,625
have on your side.

193
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,833
Especially in this
fallen world of ours.

194
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,250
[LEO]
Uh-huh.

195
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,250
[DJ FANGO] Even this scum-
sucking superior of yours.

196
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,666
[LEO]
Huh?

197
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,666
By the way, I'm curious
as to exactly how you fit in

198
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,833
amongst this collection
of oddball co-workers,

199

Are you just a regular guy?

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,875
[LEO]
Huh?

202
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,583
Oh, no. Not quite.

203
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,458
Yeah. Due to certain events,

204
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,833
and at the cost of
my sister's sight,

205
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,791
I now possess these
All-Seeing Eyes of the Gods.

206
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,833
[whimpering]

207
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,375
[LEO]
Ironically enough,

208
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,166
the powers that
sprang from this tragedy

209
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,083
are what led me to join Libra.

210
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,333
With their resources,
I might actually have a chance

211
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,666
at finding some clues on how
to return Michella's eyesight.

212
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,583
In fact, helping
my little sister

213
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,375
is the only reason
I came to this city.

214
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,625
[DJ FANGO]
Hellooo, Tragedy of L?

215
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,541
Are you still with us?

216
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,625
Uhhh, well it seems as though
he's lost, deep in thought.

217
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,041
Let's all take a moment to
collect ourselves during this

218
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,791

it's BobSons Clamcuhou.

As well as many
other fine establishments

throughout the city
proudly serving monsters.

[DJ FANGO]
Okay then, Tragedy of L.

228
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,833
I hope you're alright, now.

229
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,666
I mean, we are on the
air here. Help me out some.

230
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,416
Were you able to ruminate some
on your place in the world?

231
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,125
[LEO]
Y-Yeah. Sorry about that.

232
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,000
[DJ FANGO] Don't sweat it.
So, tell me, Tragedy of L.

233
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,333
What do you typically
do in your spare time?

234
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,041
Do you have any friends?

235
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,500
[LEO]
Any friends?

236
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,583
[DJ FANGO]
Or perhaps, a girlfriend?

Huh? A gir-gir-gir...

[DJ FANGO]
Hey, you're okay. It's okay.

240
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,083
It's fine, just breathe.

241
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,500
Breathe.

Let's be friends, Leonardo!

Very best friends!

[LEO]
Uhh-Um. Um.

247
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,083
I mean, she's really
just a friend.

248
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,625
And it goes to show
that anything

249
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,416
can happen in this world.

250
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
But out of nowhere one day,

251
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
I just happened to meet
this really cute girl.

--[LEO laughs]
--[DJ FANGO] Oh, yeah?

That's lovely.

00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,166
And you hit the nail on the
head, anything can happen.

255
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,916
Especially in this
mystical city in the mist.

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,375
Miracles beyond human
comprehension do happen here.

257
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,583
So, what's this girl like?

258
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,541
How would you describe her?

259
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,541
[LEO]
Uh.

260
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,333
You can just call me White!

[giggles]

262
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,625
I'm a ghost!

263

[LEO]
She, um, well...

264
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,458
The first time
that I met her,

265
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,291
she told me that
she was a ghost.

266
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,333
She takes stubborn to
a whole new level.

267
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,666
I'm not going back.

268
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,291
[LEO] She can get
really moody sometimes,

269
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,708
but never tells me why.

270
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,333
Oh, I'm not upset, Leonardo.

271
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,208
[LEO]
So, uh, well, to be honest,

272
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,583
I guess she's kind of
a mystery to me.

273
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,166
[laughs]

274
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,625
[DJ FANGO]
Of course, she is.

275
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,291
And you are not
alone, my friend.

276
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,291
Women remain the greatest
enigma man has ever encountered.

277
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,375
And that's the way
it'll always be.

278
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,625
They're like a question mark

given the bittersweet
nature of our conversation.

285
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,375
I'd like to play
a particular song that

286
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,500
might hit home for you.

287
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,208
It's called "White Gloves."

288
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,583
I hope you enjoy it.

When it comes to White,

I'm completely in the dark.

what was up with her that day.

Why she cried.

we've gotten to peace.

50 percent monster, 20 percent
straight-up unknown and weird,

and humans make up
the remaining 25 percent.

But half of them have
their own strange secrets.

Oh, well the

[birds chirping]

320
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,625
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Well, this takes me back.

321
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,708
Did he take that picture?

322
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,750
[frustrated exhale]

323
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,958
[WHITE]
Why?

324
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,416
[KING OF DESPAIR]
I knew those eyes of his

325
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,541
were the real deal.

326
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,666
--[door opening]
--[BOTH laughing]

327
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,458
[WHITE]
Oh, hey, Leo!

328
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,916
See? He's the one
I told you about.

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,583
My new friend.

330
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,458
Uh.

331
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,708
[distorted noise growing louder]

332
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,791
[gasps]

333
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,416
It's you! From the subway!

334
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,583
Huh?

335
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,916
I'm afraid you've got me
mixed up with someone else.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,250
Leo, right?

337
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,583
[whispering] Big brother!

338
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,416
[WHITE]
Remember? My big brother!

339
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,625
Uh.

340
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh.

341
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,458
Yeah, hey, sorry.

342
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,541
White's told me
so much about you.

343
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,875
All good things!

344
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,166
Well, most of them.

345
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,166
[WHITE]
Huh?

346
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,666
[LEO]
Uh, I mean, sorry!

347
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
[laughs]

348
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,750
[BLACK] Sounds like you
guys are pretty good friends!

349
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,416
Why'd you wait so long
to introduce us, White?

350
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,666
It's a pleasure.

351
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,083
You can just call me Black.

352
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,000
[LEO] I told Black that
I also had a sister.

353
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,666
We commiserated over feeling
like worthless older brothers.

354
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,375
After that, we hit it off pretty
well and quickly became friends.

355
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,250
It's crazy, but.

356
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,416
Black comes from a family
of casters that played

357
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,875
a large role in halting
the Great Collapse.

358
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,416
Even crazier than that,

359
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,208
they've apparently possessed
Psi powers for generations.

360
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,750
I guess it's not that
surprising considering

361
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,625
what he's been through,
but he also told me that he

362
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,583
doesn't want to be
a caster any longer.

363
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,916
[BLACK] A group of people
designated as "casters" were

364
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,708
gathered from both worlds
and together they raised

365
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,833
a barrier to
suspend the Collapse.

366
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,000
Who knows how much worse
the conjuncture could have been

367
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,333
if it weren't for their
heroic actions.

368
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,541
And yet many mysteries
plague us still.

369
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,541
The precise nature of what
occurred in the center

370
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,041
of the void persists in evading
the best minds of both worlds.

371
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,958
Reliving that night?

372
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,833
Well, once was bad enough.

373
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,208
[crackling]

374
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,083
[LEO]
So, I'll see you later, then?

375
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,333
[BLACK]
Leonardo!

376
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,458
My sister.

377
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,041
She can say strange
things sometimes,

378
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,000
but really, she's just
an ordinary girl.

379
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,083
She needs a friend like you.

380
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,500
Hmm.

381
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,125
[whistling]

382
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,750
[LEO]
Black's a good guy.

383
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,541
Just look at how much
he cares about White.

384
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,541
The thing about
Black and White.

385
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,125
Now that I know them.

386
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,041
I don't think I could really get
by without them as my friends.

387
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,416
Heh.

388
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,291
[BLACK]
He really is a nice guy, huh?

389
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,875
You never told me
where you met him.

390
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,291
[WHITE giggles]

391
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,791
At the hospital.

392
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,166
Is there any other place?

393
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,291
[BLACK] C'mon, you know
what I'm asking.

394
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,625
Don't be coy.

395
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,083
I already heard the story
so be honest with me.

396
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,750
Okay, White?

397
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,250
When I met him,

398
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,958
he really threw
me for a loop.

399
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,875
That stuff about already
meeting me on the subway?

400
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,541
I don't know.

401
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,333
It's just started to weird
me out for some reason.

402
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,125
At the time he said it,

403
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,083
I just figured he must
have gotten me mixed up

404
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,208
with someone else.

405
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,416
But now,

406
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,125
could he have been right?

407
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,541
Could I have already met him?

408
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,375
And I just didn't
know about it?

409
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,833
And then, before
I realized it.

410
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,541
He and I--

411
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,666
[WHITE]
Black!

412
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,416
Give it a rest, okay?

413
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,125
Leo was just mistaken.

414
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:30,250
It happens all the time.

415
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,208
[paper rustles]

416
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,208
[BLACK]
Tell me.

417
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,708
What the hell are
you doing with White?

418
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,750
[KING OF DESPAIR] Jeez, c'mon,
you don't have to make it

419
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,291
sound so sordid.

420
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,916
She's made a friend, right?

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
You should be
grateful for that.

422
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,541
[BLACK]
You're lying!

423
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,541
I told you you can do
whatever you want with me.

424
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,750
But you promised me that
my sister would be off limits!

425
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
That was our
agreement, wasn't it?

426
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,250
[KING OF DESPAIR]
You're being paranoid, man,

427
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,541
I'm not doing anything.

428
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,041
[BLACK]
Tell me the truth!

429
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,125
[grunting]

430
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,708
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Get some sleep.

431
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,458
Let me take a turn
for a little while.

432
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,041
Besides, I'm really not
forcing her to do anything.

433
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,250
Heh.

434
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,916
She's doing it because
she wants to do it.

435
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,833
[heavy breathing]

436
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,333
[WHITE]
Black!

437
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,375
Huh?

438
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,916
Over here!

439
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,666
[BLACK]
White.

440
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,500
White! Stay back!

441
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,833
It's not safe here!

442
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,000
[WHITE yelps]

443
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,666
[BLACK] I'll let you
have my stupid body!

444
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,125
But please, please,
leave my sister alone!

445
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,750
I'm begging you, okay?

446
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,333
But that's the only way!

447
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,500
If you need hands.

448
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,875
If you have to take...

449
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,208
then take what
you need from me!

450
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,916
[whooshing]

451
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,458
[WHITE]
William.

[sinister laugh]

454
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,000
[BLACK]
Nope.

455
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,458
My name is [no audio].

456
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,750
I'm sure we can
help each other out.

457
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,875
Eh, sister?

458
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,875
[whistling]

459
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,333
Huh?

460
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,041
Is that you, Black?

461
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,041
[footsteps approaching]

462
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,625
I'm gonna need you to go get
your friend's eyeballs for me.

463
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,416
You do that,

464
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,375
and I'll give you
your brother back.

465
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,958
That is the deal
we made, after all.

466
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,208
But Leo's such a nice guy.

467
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,041
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Yep.

468
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,291
[WHITE]
He's got a little sister too.

469
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,333
[KING OF DESPAIR]
I'm aware.

470
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,333
[WHITE]
It reminds me of us.

471
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,333
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Yeah, I suppose.

472
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,791
[WHITE]
It's just that I--

473
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,458
I don't wanna lose
Leo as my friend.

474
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,916
[WHITE]
Over here.

475
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,833
Mm?

476
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,458
[LEO] Are you getting bored with
the graveyard for a change?

477
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,166
I've never seen you in here.

478
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,666
[WHITE]
Well, yeah.

479
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,166
Most people only come
here when they need to pray.

480
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,208
So it's a little unnatural
for me to be in here.

481
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,750
[LEO]
Hmm.

482
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,125
--[LEO's footsteps approach]
--[clothes rustle as he sits]

483
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,375
I get that. I guess ghosts don't
really need to pray, do they?

484
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,625
[WHITE]
Huh?

485
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,041
Heh. Exactly.

486
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,500
But now, I can't help but
feel I need to say a prayer.

487
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,791
For your sake, Leo.

488
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,958
Mm?

489
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,833
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Don't lie in a church.

490
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,708
I bet you really do wanna pray,

491
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,291
but the only person
that you're thinking

492
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,916
about praying for is you.

493
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875
After everything
you've taken part in,

494
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,791
you can't seriously still
be hoping for salvation.

495
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,125
I swear, you humans
are chock-full of hubris.

496
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,083
Is that Black?

497
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,916
[WHITE] The All-Seeing
Eyes of the Gods.

498
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,916
I want you to give them to me.

499
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,541
Give me your eyes, Leo.

500
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,791
[DJ FANGO] Well, look at that,
we're just about out of time.

501
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,208
So how do you feel,
Tragedy of L?

502
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,625
I can't honestly say that
I offered you any advice,

503
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,375
but did talking help at all?

504
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,208
[LEO] Yeah! I feel like I've got
a fresh perspective on things.

505
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,000
[DJ FANGO]
Glad to hear it, Tragedy of L.

506
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,083
With that in mind,
how about we make our way

507
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,458
onto the dance floor

508
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,916
and whirl through this
wonderful, maddening world?

509
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,833
I've got
the perfect song for it.

510
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,000
Here's Unison
Square Garden with...

511
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,458
[DJ FANGO and LEO]
"Sugar Song and Bitter Step."

512
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,208
[WHITE] For what reason was I
ever needed in the first place?

513
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,333
[BLACK]
What exactly do I have to do

514
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,041
to keep myself
from forgetting?

515
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,166
[WHITE] Every time I
lifted my head to look up...

516
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,708
[BLACK]
I was always right there.

517
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,041
--[WHITE] To me...
--[BLACK] To me...

518
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,458
--[WHITE] You were...
--[BLACK] You were...

519
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,416
[WHITE]
The whole world.

520
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,916
[BLACK]
No matter what happens,

521
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,416
I know that you'll be the one
thing that never changes.

522
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,875
[WHITE]
The one and only thing.

523
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,375
[BLACK]
Shaping everything.

524
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,958
[WHITE]
And turning it around.

525
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,583
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront,"

526
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,000
[BLACK]
Paint It Black.

527
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,000
This one's for you.

528
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,875
[WHITE]
Sure, but who am I?
