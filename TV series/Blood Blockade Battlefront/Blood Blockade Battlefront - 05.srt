...homicidal psycho
chick, please!

166
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,500
[ALIGURA]
He got taken away from me.

167
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,708
By that big man with
the scary jerk face.

168
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,500
Are you talking about Klaus?

169
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,625
So that's his name?

170
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,166
Is that why you're
holding me hostage?

171
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,666
What makes you think
I need a hostage

172
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,000
to get what I want?

173
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,750
You think I'm some
dumb-dumb witch?

174
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,166
[LEO]
Aren't you planning

175
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,666
to use my magic eyes
to find your dude?

176
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,791
[ALIGURA]
I don't need the

177
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,541
All-Seeing Eyes of the Gods.

178
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,583
Just what kind of trash
do you take me for?

179
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,750
[ALIGURA]
After all, he's my man.

180
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,958
I'll find him, and I
will take him back.

181
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,666
I'll do it all on my own.

182
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,416
And I'll do it for my
own personal satisfaction.

183
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,666
It would kind of cheapen it
if I accepted someone's help.

184
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,333
How else will he know
we're soul-mates?

00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,291

I found you, babe!

That Aligura.

The butcher girl.

do you think you're doing?

192
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,166

Huh?

00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,708

Exocrimson!

[KING OF DESPAIR]
Getting a kick out of this, huh?

205
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,958
Aligura better not have killed

206
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,166
the All-Seeing Eyes
of the Gods kid.

207
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,375
I wasn't expecting that.

208
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,583
You got plans for him?

209
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,041
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Yeah, you could say that.

210
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,458
He blew himself across the city
with the power of his punch.

211
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,916
I noticed, but his shot
did slow her momentum.

212
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,291
[KLAUS]
This is our chance.

213

[DELDRO]
Jeez, man.

214
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,041
Why'd you throw
a punch like that?

215
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,291
Try thinking next time.

216
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,833
Sorry, man.

217
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,666
If you weren't safe in my guts,
that would've killed you.

218
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,041
Let's not get morbid here!

219
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,875
And if I were dead, you'd
be dead, too, Deldro!

220
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,375
[DELDRO]

[STARPHASE coughs]

222
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,708
That's beside the point.

00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,125
[HUMMER]
Hey! You guys!

224
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,166
Isn't this great?

225
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,666
I mean, can you imagine?

226
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,375
Us being able
to fight together.

227
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,041
Like old times!

00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:33,916
I'm so happy.

Yeah.

You know, man, no kidding

you're still the same
as you ever were.

You're too kind.

[ZAPP]
Not a compliment, dude.

235
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,500
Can we get back to it?

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,458
Yeah!

237
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,416
If it's no trouble,
do you guys mind if we go

238
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,416
someplace with slightly
better footing?

239
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,291
[STARPHASE]
Why not?

00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,250
Cool blood body power.

00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,041
And that face. You're just
adorable, Dog Hummer.

[ZAPP]
Huh?

if you're into that stuff.

You, too? He is not that hot!

I kind of get

247
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,583
what the Queen of Monomania
is so monomaniacal about.

00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,666
[CHAIN]
And how.

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,208
[ZAPP]
What?

00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,541
C'mon, give me a break here!

251
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,625
You don't even have a reason
for me to be here, right?

[ALIGURA]
No.

00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,125
I have reasons.

Can you please just let me go?

255

[ALIGURA]
I told you, silly.

256
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,958
I need you!

257
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,041
[LEO]
What am I supposed to do

258
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,291
all tied up like this?

259
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,958
[ALIGURA]
Swap love stories, maybe?

[LEO]
Please, please save me, Klaus.

261

about your

nothing to tell.

you don't have a

That's so sad.

There's at least someone
you like, isn't there?

to be able to come up

with at least one stupid
person to talk about!

Only a jerk leaves a girl
hanging with nothing to say!

277

[LEO]
Um. I wouldn't say "like,"

You'd completely forgotten

about Aligura until
just now, hadn't you?

I'm surprised how
sudden that was.

Here's the thing about love.

It really made me wish
my sister were here.

485
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,125
I guess--

486
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,750
I guess I miss her pretty bad.

487
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,500
Michella.

488
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,708
She's the one who's always
got herself well-put-together.

489
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,791
I'm her older brother,

490
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,666
but I just make
her life harder.

491
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
I must sound pretty pathetic.

492
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,666
[WHITE]
No, I don't think so.

493
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,833
You're a great guy, Leo.

494
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,083
[FEMT]
Well, how's it going there,

495
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,125
ladies and gentlemen?

496
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,916
This is the
King of Depravity, Femt,

497
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
previewing your next episode!

498
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,041
I'll bet you never even
dreamed that the same

499
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,750
character would take
the mound twice!

500
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,291
You idiots!

501
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,583
You haven't learned a thing,
even after all these episodes,

502
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,125
have you?

503
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,625
Who'd have thought that the
day would come when I would be

504
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,166
fearful about the
fall of mankind?

505
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,125
Ha! It must be the
end of the world.

506
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,458
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront,"

507
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,416
Don't forget to
Don't Forget Me!

508
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,916
Now, be sure not to lose sight

509
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,250
of just who I am, okay?

510
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,916
You feelin' me?
Know what I'm saying?
