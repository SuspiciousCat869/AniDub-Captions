Don't let your guard down

So the basics of the blade form

are the same for
the Shinatobe style.

Frankly, I'm amazed
you're not a pile of corpses,

And your brother,
he's the bid.

as far as I'm getting.

Oh, thanks.

324
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,375
[KLAUS]
Hey, Leonardo.

325
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,625
It wasn't just your eyes
we welcomed here.

326
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Not in the least.
You know that,

327
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,625
now don't you?

328
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,666
[BEN]
Black?

329
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,791
You mean Will?

330
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,791
[WHITE]
Uh-huh.

331
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,083
[BEN]
How'd you think of that?

332
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,625
[WHITE]
Duh, daddy!

333
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,708
You're the one who said it!

334
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,291
Will is like black sake
and I'm like white sake.

335
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,375
[BEN]
Oh, yeah.

336
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:05,000
You know that I was just
making an analogy, right?

337
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,250
And I was kinda drunk.

338
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,541
Yeah, I know.

339
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,750
Anyway, I still think it's cool.

340
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,916
Yeah?

341
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,083
Mom totally agrees
with me, too.

342
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,541
Oh?

343
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,041
Actually,

344
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,458
you know what?

345
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,541
I'm starting to see
how fitting it is.

346
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,291
My two kids,

347
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,791
Black and White.

348
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,583
[WHITE] White and black are
like the complete opposite

349
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,500
on the color spectrum, right?

350
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,083
And that's exactly
how William and I are.

351
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,291
[BEN]
That's right.

352
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,000
But even so,

353
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,625
from where I'm sitting,

354
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,958
the two of you are more
alike than you might realize.

355
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,000
Hmm?

356
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,416
Well yeah, of course
we are, Dad.

357
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,291
We are twins.

358
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,958
That you are, Mary.

359
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,791
There's certainly
no denying that one.

360
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,750
From here on out,

361
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,708
I want you to keep
an eye on Will.

362
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,041
If it ever looks like he's
about to make a mistake,

363
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,291
you've gotta set him on
the right track, okay?

364
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,916
[WHITE]
Shouldn't he look out for me?

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,333
[BEN]
You don't need it.

366
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,541
[WHITE] What kind of mistakes
are you talking about?

367
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,875
[BEN]
Uh, I guess if you ever see him

368
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,666
about to hurt someone,
or maybe, an animal?

369
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,250
[WHITE]
What? William?

370
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,166
I think that's the craziest
thing you've ever said!

371
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,458
[BEN] Yeah. No, I know
how crazy it sounds!

372
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,750
[WHITE laughing]

373
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,458
[BLACK]
Hey, White!

374
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,083
Hey, what's up, Black?

375
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,416
You wanna know something?

376
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,958
You are both
one and the same.

377
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,375
--[WHITE] What's that?
--[BLACK laughs]

378
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,708
[BEN]
A little wish.

379
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,333
[laughs]

380
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,541
[BEN] That you'll
always have each other,

381
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,625
and that you'll always
keep each other happy.

382
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,791
[crying]

383
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,750
[WHITE]
Dad.

384
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,250
Mom.

385
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,416
[KING OF DESPAIR laughs]

386
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,500
[ZED]
My name's Zed O'Brien.

387
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,208
I'm Libra's newest
charity case.

388
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:14,458
I wasn't exactly given
the most gentle introduction.

389
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,833
And with only three episodes
left, I am a little anxious

390
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,250
about what's to come,

391
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,875
but I guess that's all
part of the training.

392
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,708
I'm getting along
well with everyone,

393
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,750
and they're weirdly nice to me.

394
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,666
Excluding Zapp.

395
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,750
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront,"

396
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,916
Run! Lunch!
Run! To the end.

397
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,333
If it takes this much
effort just to get lunch,

398
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:33,958
well, I guess it
shouldn't be so surprising

399
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,333
that the rest of
life is so hard.
