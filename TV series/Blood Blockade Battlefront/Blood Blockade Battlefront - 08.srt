Hellsalem's Lot.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,125
Once known as New York City.

12
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,083
Three years ago,

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,083
a disastrous anomaly,
subsequently labeled

14
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,708
the Great Collapse of New York,

15
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,458
opened an inter-dimensional
sinkhole beneath the city.

16
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,458
The Great Collapse came
as a catastrophic shock

17
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,000
to our world,

18
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,916
and to the world resting on
the other side of the portal.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A group of people
designated as "casters"

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,958
were gathered
from both worlds,

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,875
and together they raised a
barrier to suspend the Collapse.

22
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,083
Who knows how much worse
the conjuncture could have been

23
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,500
if it weren't for
their heroic actions.

24
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,041
And yet many mysteries
plague us still.

25
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,291
The precise nature of
what occurred in the center

26
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,708
of the void persists in evading
the best minds of both worlds.

research into the phenomenon

continues to this day.

are involved now.

had a better chance.

[muffled screaming]

165
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,375
Move back from the door
and cover up your ears!

166
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,791
[explosion]

167
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,958
You cut it way too close.

168
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,875
And that really
pisses me off.

169
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,916
Huh?

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,791
Another thing.

171
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do I find myself
stuck with you yet again?

172
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,916
Now, now, come on, take it easy.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,125
I think we've adequately
sized up the area.

174
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,666
So, you know, let's go.

175
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,583
Ugh!

176
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,750
[KK]
All right.

177
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,458
Which one's the Blood Breed?

178
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,333
You did say that it was
missing half its body, right?

179
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,500
If that's the case,
it's gotta be that one.

180
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,541
[STARPHASE]
Yeah, but...

181
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,166
don't forget where we are.

182
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,291
It's tough to judge someone by
appearances in this city, KK.

183
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,166
[STARPHASE, KK]
Mirrors.

184
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,916

That one!

[STARPHASE]
Wait. Why's it going after Zapp?

188
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,750
[KK] Okay, we know this
one's the Blood Breed.

189
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,833
So who is that one?

190
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,875
[squealing]

191
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,750
Please, I'm sorry, Master!

192
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,375
Please, just cut me
some slack, all right?

193
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,791
[ice cracking]

194
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,166
[KK] He shed his
upper torso to escape.

195
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,500
[STARPHASE]
He's regenerating in mid-air.

196
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,125
We're screwed.

197
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,708
[BOTH gasp]

[JUGEI speaks in alien language]

199
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,500
Nicely done.

200
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,291
Wait, he's still regenerating.

201
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,000
Saddle up, K.K.
Let's hit him a few more times.

202
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,250
[JUGEI speaking]

[K.K.]
Wind?

204
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,791
Don't tell me he's
a double-attribute master.

205
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:13,916
So it's not a legend.

206
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,000
That is the real
deal right there.

207
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,583
Is that a Zen Tai Dan?

208
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,166
[ZAPP possessed voice]
Yes, it is indeed.

209
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,208
You've finally reached
a level of knowledge

210
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,250
attainable from literature,
you worthless amateurs.

211
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,500
But yes, that is the final,
self-enclosed form

212
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,666
of the Blood Breeds.

213
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,916
Now imprint its staggering
image upon your

214

[ZAPP in normal voice]
No! It's not me!

He's just speaking
through me, I swear!

It is a true honor to meet you.

[ZAPP possessed voice]
Dispense with the flattery.

224
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,083
Compliments of one
so deeply unskilled

225
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,125
that they were uncertain
of whom to attack carry

226
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,458
less than zero value to me.

227
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,208
[ZAPP normal voice] I already
told you, that's not me talking!

228
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,375
[STARPHASE]
This particular Blood Breed.

229
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,958
Would you consider
him one of the more

230
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,375
formidable opponents
you've fought?

231
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,791
[ZAPP possessed voice] Well,
now. That's difficult to say.

232
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,375
[STARPHASE ]
My word.

233
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,791
He is certainly an elusive one.

234
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,791
I've heard stories
of him going missing

235
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,458
for decades at a time.

236
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,625
There was evidence discovered
during those intervals

237
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,708
of the slaying of some high-
ranking Blood Breeds.

238
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,500
It's speculated that it
was all his handy work.

239
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,166
Well,

240
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,208
I doubt he'd
admit it if it was.

241
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,875
[ZAPP possessed voice]
You're the one whose blood

242
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,125
is infused with the
incarceration technique?

243
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Yes, sir.

244
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,875
My name is Klaus Von Reinherz.

245
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,833
I'm the leader of Libra.

246
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,791
[ZAPP possessed voice] You
have a foreboding countenance,

247
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,958
but you're far too
inexperienced to be a leader.

248
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,916
Look here for example.

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,916
You've let this undisciplined
swollen sack of garbage

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,750
who calls me Master
become a balloon

251
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,666
filled with cholesterol
and diarrhea.

252
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,458
He's like an overripe pimple or
a bowl of rancid, toxic custard.

253
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,125
You couldn't make anything more
repulsive if you molded

254
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,291
pure hatred into
the shape of a human

255
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,291
and infused it with
maggots and feces.

256
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,750
He wastes his days
indulging in decadence.

257
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,333
Letting his potential
rot like a corpse.

258
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,250
Polluting the universe
with his very existence.

259
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,666
Just looking at him makes
you lose all hope in life.

260
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,958
Such a contemptible waste
of matter and sentience.

261
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,541
If it weren't for the noxious
gas his tattered and feeble

262
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,416
sphincter might
release, I'd step on him

263
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,291
like the cockroach he is.

264
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,500
Wow, poor bastard.

265
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,166
[ZAPP possessed voice]
Regardless, I'll be

266
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,750

And like hell I'm going
to train with you!

you've taught him,

he is an indispensable

so he says he wants me
to attack and incapacitate

Kind of like a test, I guess.

with hyper-reflexive attacks.

301

It can't even be budged
without it lashing out.

302
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,791
It has six eyeball-like

That's easy for you to say,

but if I'm off by even
point one second.

[JUGEI speaks]

308

[ZAPP] At best, he'll just
cut off both your arms,

and at worst, all that
will be left are your feet.

Please, Master!

You simply can't expect him
to succeed in this manner.

It's too much.

Let's do this.

If he's willing to go this far,

00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,916
Jeez, are they out
of their minds?

484
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,291
Let's go watch!

485
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,541
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Sure is bustling out there.

486
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,875
What's going on today?

487
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,208
[BLACK]
Why would I know?

488
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,666
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Look at all of them!

489
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,458
They're just a bunch of
half-wit rubberneckers.

490
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,791
No fun at all.

491
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,791
Right?

492
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:14,791
[BLACK]
Just drop the small talk.

493
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,791
Tell me.

494
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,375
What the hell

495
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,666
are you doing with White?

496
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
Jeez, come on, you
don't have to make it

497
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,250
sound so sordid.

498
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,458
She made a friend, right?

499
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,875
You should be grateful for that.

500
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:26,916
[frustrated exhale]

501
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,250
[BLACK]
You're lying!

502
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,625
I told you you can do
whatever you want with me.

503
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,083
But you promised
me that my sister

504
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,541
would be off limits!

505
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,041
That was our
agreement, wasn't it?

506
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,166
[KING OF DESPAIR laughs]
You're being paranoid, man,

507
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,333
I'm not doing anything.

508
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,791
[BLACK]
Tell me the truth!

509
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,541
[grunting]

510
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,291
[KING OF DESPAIR]
Get some sleep.

511
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,000
Let me take a turn
for a little while.

512
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,333
Besides,

513
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,166
I'm really not forcing
her to do anything.

514
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,125
She's doing it because
she wants to do it.

515
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,916
[moaning]

516
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,500
[WHITE]
I hate the fog.

517
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,291
[ZAPP] Thinking back on
it, there wasn't a single

518
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,208
decent moment in
this whole day.

519
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,375
I woke up in horrendous agony.

520
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,041
I was hungover.

521
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,041
I'm walking down the street and
a washtub falls out of the sky.

522
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,208
Why?

523
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,791
And to top it off,
some dude I don't know

524
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,666
keeps showing up at
the girl I like's apartment.

525
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,541
Simply unacceptable.

526
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,125
And none of it's my fault!

527
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,291
It's all thanks to that
sadistic old buzzard!

528
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,041
Get out of my life!

529
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,500
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront,"

530
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,000
Z's Longest Day Part 2.

531
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,458
Why is it "Z"?

532
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,708
Was "Zapp" not short enough?
They're both one syllable!
