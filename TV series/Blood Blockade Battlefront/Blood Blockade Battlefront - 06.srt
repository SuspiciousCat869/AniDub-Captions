I'll get your burgers for you.

163
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,375
Seriously?

164
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,666
Thank you!

165
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,416
How much extra do you
want me to pay for 'em?

166
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,708
That's not what I'm saying here.

167
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,291
You keep your money.

168
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,875
There's just a lot about this
situation I'm not cool with.

169
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,291
You know, you're
a really nice guy,

170
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,250
person who didn't
give me his burger.

171
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,541
You've really gotta
stop calling me that.

172
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,291
Especially now.

173
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,541
My name is Leonardo Watch.
Nice to meet you.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:51,166
Amagranoff Luozontam
Ouv Lee Nej.

175
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,916
Come again?

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,458
You can call me Nej. Leonardo
who didn't give me his burger.

177
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,958
[NEJ]
Whoa! Whoa!

178
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,666
What in the awesome is that?

179
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,375
You get 'em if you eat there.

180
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,041
It's a Jack Funny Face wrapper.

181
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,666
So cool! It's just
like the comic book!

182
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,708
Ron Jomita Jr.!

183
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,833
Ron who?

184
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,958
He's a penciler!

185
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,291
And what's that?

186
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,583
You don't have to
get so frustrated.

187
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,083
Didn't your mom ever tell you to
be patient with other people?

188
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,625
Hmm...

189
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,541
My mom, huh?

190
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,541
I guess that means
you've got a mom, huh, Leo?

191
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,833
[LEO]
Hm? Well, yeah.

192
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,458
[NEJ]
You know what?

193
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,041
I don't remember my mom.

194
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,625
Like at all.

195
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,625
[LEO]
Oh.

196
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,833
What, did she leave?

197
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,916
Back when you were little?

198
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,000
[NEJ]
No, it's more like,

199
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,791
I know there is a person
who gave birth to me,

200
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,500
but both me and her...

201
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,541
neither of us have any memory
of the other one, you see.

202
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,000
[LEO]
Huh.

203
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,416
But still, you were probably

204
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,916
just too young
to remember her, Nej.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,291
But I'm sure that
she remembers you.

206
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,583
[NEJ]
You would think so, right?

207
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,083
But my mother, and I
know this for a fact,

208
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,458
she doesn't even remember
giving birth to me.

209
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,166
[DELIVERYMAN 1]
Damn it, man!

210
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,375
What do we do?

211
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,083
What the hell do we do now?

212
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,833
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
That is the question, huh?

213
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,416
That gun, just feeling
it against my temple.

214
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,000
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
It definitely wasn't fun.

215
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,541
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
Dammit, man, not again.

216
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,458
Ah, c'mon! You don't have
to make me feel bad, dude!

217
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, and you don't
have to piss your pants

218
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,208
while we're in
the truck, either.

219
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
I can't take the smell, okay?

220
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,166
Take the mask off!

221
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,333
I mean it!

222
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,041
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
Oh, crap!

223
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,625
That's twice in one month!

224
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,166
It's that same turd fungus!

225
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,833
[NEJ]
I'm sorry!

226
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,541
[DELIVERYMAN 2] This isn't
really the best place.

227
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,375
[MALE 1]
They run him over and now this?

228
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,833
[MALE 2]
Shouldn't someone stop him?

229
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,125
He's gonna kill him.

230
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,208
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
Enough, man,

231
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,708
the mushroom said
he was sorry.

232
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,666
Let's just go, all right?

233
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait, was the
toadstool always that color?

234
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,250
Or is that blood?

235
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,416
[FEMALE 1]
I'm sure it's fine.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,166
Do those things even feel pain?

237
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,583
[MALE 3]
This is what that mushroom gets

238
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,208
for not looking
where it's going.

239
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,583
[MALE 4]
None of this would've happened

240
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,166
if he'd just stayed away from
Ghetto Heights

241
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,291
in the first place.

242
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,250
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
Alright, c'mon, man.

243
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,416
You got your punches in.

244
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,916
You're goin' too far!

245
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,458
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
What the hell?

246
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,750
What's happening?

247
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,083
No, no, no, no, no!

248
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,958
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
How can you not remember?

249
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,500
If he'd been human, your ass
would be in jail right now.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,916
Whatever. The past is the past.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,458
C'mon, let's go. We've
got money to raise.

252
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,000
Why're ya just sittin' there?

253
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,416
Why are you in such a hurry?

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,916
You freaking out about the
money we owe to Gallardo?

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,833
Calm down, it's not like
there's a gun to our heads.

256
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,500
[STARPHASE]
A sudden mass fainting?

257
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,458
[CHAIN]
Yes.

258
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,791
[STARPHASE]
That's weird,

259
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,625
but it doesn't sound like
anything to worry about.

260
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,166
And it happened over
by Ghetto Heights?

261
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,041
Not exactly the
most tolerant group.

262
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,666
As long as there
wasn't any damage,

263
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
I say we just chalk it
up to the existence

264
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,583
of an actual sandman.

265
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
[CHAIN]
It's not that simple.

266
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,833
Everyone involved
in the incident

267
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,500
has developed
amnesia as well.

268
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,375
Huh.

269
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,500
[CHAIN]
Not a single one

270
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,541
of the people who passed out

271
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,125
can remember anything
from exactly

272
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,458
13 hours before the event.

273
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
And that leaves us
without an eyewitness

274
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,291
or any way of knowing
what might have caused it.

275
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,750
[STARPHASE]
Yeah, I take it back.

276
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,333
This is very serious.

277
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,333
If we assume that someone
intentionally pulled this off,

278
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,458
well, then they could commit
any crime they wanted

279
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,458
and it'd be like it
never happened.

280
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
What's wrong, Leo?

281
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,541
[LEO]
Nej. Nej. Were you behind this?

282
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,208
If he did do this,

283
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,750
why didn't I take a
closer look at his aura?

284
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,166
No. I'm over on
Dessau Leak Street.

What's the matter?

You're covered in sweat.

[LEO]
There you are!

289
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
Where have you been?

290
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,791
[NEJ]
I was sleeping.

291
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,916
I've been searching everywhere.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,166
I was worried that
you'd forgotten me.

293
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,083
[NEJ]
No, that would never happen.

294
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,041
You must think I'm
a pretty big dummy

295
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,041
if you think I
could do that, Leo.

296
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,708
But hey, check this out!

297
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,083
It's Jack!

298
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,458
I have no idea
where this came from.

299
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,000
But the penciler was
Ron Jomita Jr.,

300
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
so whatever it is,
it's the real deal!

301
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,083
Isn't that awesome?

302
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,791
And it was just
stuffed inside my pocket!

[DELIVERYMAN 1]
Hey, man.

305
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,125
Are you really sure this is
gonna help us pay off our debt?

306
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,416
[DELIVERYMAN 2]
How many damn times

307
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,916
are you gonna make
me explain this?

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,416
If we can harvest
this mushroom's spores,

309
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,875
we can get away
with whatever we want.

Trust me on this.

311

I'm the only one
who saw it go down.

312

Everyone there
dropped like flies

313
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,958
and they don't remember a thing.

314
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,791
If I hadn't been so freaked out,

315
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,458
I could've stolen every
one of their wallets.

Hm?

317
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,541
I know you're having
trouble believing this now,

318
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,083
but once we're done here,
