myself to you for a while.

My sister's really built
up the Legend of Leo.

About her illness?

15
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,916
I mean, I know she's been in
the hospital for three years.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,791
But, uh, she told me that!
I wasn't snooping!

17
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,083
But that's all I really know.

19
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,916
Her heart is not
her best friend.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,375
But she's been doing pretty
okay right now, I guess.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,708
[LEO]
Oh.

22
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,958
I never should have
taken her out of her room!

23
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,333
I could have killed her!

24
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,458
What was I thinking?

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,166
She's sick, after
all, isn't she?

26
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,750
Gah! I'm so stupid!

27
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,416
White's really strong-willed
and kind of self-centered,

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,708
and a tomboy to boot.

29
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,166
Must be hard to
be her friend.

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm sure your hands are
full hanging out with her.

It's like hanging
with my sister.

Except, you know, different.

Oh, wow.

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,666
I didn't know you had a sister.

Mm-hmm. They've both got the
strong-willed thing in common.

[BLACK chuckles]

39
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,333
[LEO]
She always refers to me

40
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,416
as her "tortoise knight,"
whatever that means.

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,416
I get the feeling
she's making fun of me.

42
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,875
[BLACK]
The "tortoise" part maybe,

43
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,375
but what's wrong
with being a "knight"?

44
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,375
She knows you've got her back.

45
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,083
I'm jealous of you, actually,

46
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,125
because with me and White,
she's always been my champion.

47
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,666
I got teased a lot at school

48
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,666
for being small
and having four eyes,

49
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,583
but White always defended me.

50
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,166
She fought for me
against bullies

51
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,750
twice her size,

52
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,833
and she always won, too.

53
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,166
And I love her for it,

54
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,375
but it made me feel so
pathetic I wanted to die.

55
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,708
But I survived, somehow.

messing with me

"pipsqueak" or "squinty,"

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,625
Excuse me for interrupting
your work here,

164
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,541
but I'm hoping you can tell
me where to find my friend.

165
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,791
[REFEREE]
Sure thing, sure thing.

166
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,541
Now Eden's got two rules!

167
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,625
Number one:

168
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,166
"No Weapons Allowed!"

169
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,250
Number two:

170
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,500
"All Fights are Single Combat!"

171
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
Now you know
how the game goes!

172
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,666
If you fight well,
you'll get to see Zapp.

173
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,291
Whoa! Now you just slow
your roll there, buddy!

174
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,125
Getting rough with
me gets you nowhere!

175
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,458
Especially since you
don't know where he is,

176
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,625
or how many bullets could
burrow through his brain

177
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,083
while you wasted your
time thrashing me.

178
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,916
Sorry for the scrutiny,

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,416
but we don't know who
we're dealing with.

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,791
We have few rules,
but they must be followed,

181
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,208
so no surprise weapons.

182
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,875
[SPECTATOR 1]
I thought Libra

183
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:53,791
was an urban legend.

184
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,750
[SPECTATOR 2]
I've never met

185
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,041
one of them before.

00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,125
[SPECTATOR 3]
That huma looks familiar to me.

[SPECTATOR 4]
He can't be that strong.

188
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,625
He's got a damn scary
face though, huh?

189
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,916
Dude's got a mean
look in his eye.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,458
They all look the same to me.

191
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,500
Looks like my plumber.

192
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,083
Meet your challenger!

Okay, place your bets, scumbags!

Hey! You're a little
confused, huh?

197
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,708
It's pretty simple.

Just keep your eyes
on the prize, man.

199
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,791
Your life is at stake.

200
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm guessing from
the look of you

201
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,208
that you can handle yourself.

Fists against fists, man.

There's no other fight like

205

two men duking it out.

Why don't we prove
it to this creepshow?

they won't soon forget?

He's supposed to
pull his punches.

He won't kill your man.

a step into the street and
with the pull of a trigger

they could bring down an enemy,

even curse each
other with magic,

cooks with generic ingredients.

You've got to accept

Don't you understand what
him challenging you means?

We're talking total ownership of
this fighting den as the prize!

It's started! It's started!

[OZMALDO] He keeps a constant
defense with his left,

while his right is
always ready to strike

from the shortest distance.

369
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,250
He doesn't fight like
any common barroom brawler.

370
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,500
It's as if he's armed
with a shield and spear.

371
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,750
A Spartan defense.

372
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,541
In bareknuckle fighting,
all limbs are weapons.

373
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,833
There's no restriction at all
on kicks, holds, or throws.

374
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,875
Yet he's ruled by
some honor code.

375
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,791
It's illogical, yet so simple
that he sees every move coming.

376
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,375
Where did he learn
such discipline?

377
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,625
Most excellent.

378
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,333
Makes me doubt my own sanity.

to take you head on!

381
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,708
Ozmaldo's putting his
undefeated title on the line.

382
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,916
And he's not letting go easy,

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,750
but maybe all this action

384
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,333
will tune the chief up a notch.

[ZAPP]
No, actually, not a chance.

389
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,833
The chief seems too
structured a fighter

390
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,458
to adjust his blows, so
it looks like he's stuck

391
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,916
in the same pattern
when focusing.

392
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,666
But that's just because he
sets his own limitations

393
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,375
and sticks with them until
they aren't working anymore.

394

When I said this might
tune the chief up?

I should explain.

borrowing his corpse.

Halloween's kind of a sacred

The kids don't get candy,

but the people believe
on All Hallows' Eve

that this world

00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
[BLACK]
Leonardo!

482
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,041
My sister.

483
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,500
She can say strange
things sometimes,

484
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,625
but really,

485
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,250
she's just an ordinary girl.

486
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,208
She needs a friend like you.

487
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,208
We're both counting on you,

488
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,416
ol' tortoise knight!

489
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,375
[LEO]
Huh? Hey!

490
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,750
Please don't start with that!

491
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:30,625
[BLACK laughs]

492
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,916
[LEO]
Until next time.

493
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,666
[whistling]

494
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,083
[13 KINGS 1]
Tie, go again!

495
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,125
[13 KINGS 2]
First is rock!

496
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,375
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

497
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,916
On the count of three!

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,541
One, two, three!

499
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,541
[MAN]
My, oh, my,

500
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,958
what a welcome visitor!

501
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,333
What's up with you?

502
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,833
[BLACK]
Eh, nothing much.

503
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,250
Hey, shut your holes!

504
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,333
Take a hike!

505
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,291
I've got the next go, obviously.

506
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,791
--[13 KINGS 1] Huh?
--[13 KINGS 2] Boo!

507
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,875
You suck!

508
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,041
So things are finally
getting started?

509
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,041
[BLACK]
Nope.

510
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,541
Not even close,
King of Depravity.

511
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,958
Finally ending.

512
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,583
The moment of My Great Collapse.

513
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,708
To the rescue.

514
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,333
[VIVIAN]
Hey there, come on in!

515
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,250
I guess you're getting pretty
used to it around here, huh?

516
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,833
Of course, it kind
of forces you

517
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:14,708
to get used to it.

518
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,750
With this much abnormality,

519
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,083
you kind of have
to adjust, right?

520
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,291
Careful, though.

521
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,875
You don't wanna die
before you figure out

522
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,583
you're living in a fool's warped
idea of paradise, do you?

523
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,291
Next time on
"Blood Blockade Battlefront,"

524
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,791
Z's Longest Day. Part 1.

525
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,250
In case of emergency,

526
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,041
or if you're hungry,
stop on by Dianne's Diner!

527
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,416
I'll always be here.

528
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,375
Pretty much.

529
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,416
Like, always.
