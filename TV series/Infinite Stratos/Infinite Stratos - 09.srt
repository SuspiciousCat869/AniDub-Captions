1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:08,244
[♪]

2
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,848
[Tabane] I know that ringtone...

3
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:12,517
Hi‐hi‐hidey‐ho!

4
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:17,356
This is Tabane Shinonono,
everyone's favorite superstar!

5
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:21,162
No, no! Hold on, please!
Don't hang up on me, Houki!

6
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:22,831
Hey Sis...

7
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,699
[Tabane] Hey to you too,
little sis!

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,403
Yeah, yeah, I already know what
you're calling about.

9
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:30,942
You want one don't you?
Your own personal unit!

10
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,910
Of course I have one ready.

11
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,381
It's over spec,
with high‐end capabilities!

12
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:38,285
It'll stand toe‐to‐toe
with the Byaku! Mmhmm!

13
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:40,721
This IS unit is known as...

14
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,224
Akatsubaki!

15
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,844
[screaming]

16
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:42,319
Hang on...
Is it morning?

17
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,422
When did you get in here?!

18
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,090
Ah! Not looking!
Cover up! Cover up!

19
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,928
But I have always heard that
there aren't supposed to be...

20
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,365
any secrets in a
healthy marriage.

21
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,534
You haven't forgotten I've made
you my bride...?

22
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,470
Bride?! What the hell are
you talking about?

23
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,406
Well, in Japan,
if there's someone you like,

24
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:01,578
you're supposed to call them
"my bride" or "one's bride,"
isn't that correct?

25
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:05,584
[Ichika] Wh‐Who...
What idiot told you tha‐?!

26
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,419
Ow, ow, ow!

27
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,055
You need to spend much
more time...

28
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,991
practicing your
hand‐to‐hand combat!

29
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,361
You're so strong!

30
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,630
If you would like to polish
your wrestling skills,

31
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,568
I offer myself to be your
training partner for this.

32
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,404
[Ichika] What are you blushing
about that for?!

33
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,206
[knocking]
[Houki] It's me, Ichika.

34
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,442
Time to start our
morning drills!

35
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,648
[Houki] It may be Sunday,
but that's no reason to
slack off, so‐
[struggling]

36
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,527
Such indecency! Barging into a
married couple's bedroom!

37
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,634
[Ichika] Wait, Houki!
[Houki] Married?!

38
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,438
You'll die!
[screaming]

39
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:55,051
What a terrible way to start
off my day!

40
00:03:55,151 --> 00:04:00,458
U‐Uh, say, why did you invite
me to come along with you today?

41
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,494
Well the class beach
trip's coming up,

42
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:05,732
and I was thinking you said you
didn't have a swimsuit,

43
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:09,069
so I was going to come to town
and buy some new trunks
for myself,

44
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,473
and I thought,
while I was at it...

45
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,909
While you were...

46
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,082
Oh yes, I figured it must be
something like that.

47
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,316
Did you say something, Charles?

48
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,953
[Charlotte] Argh!
It's "Charlotte"!

49
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,589
I told you to call me that when
it's just the two of us!

50
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,293
[Ichika] Oh, you certainly did.
Sorry, Charlotte.

51
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:31,400
Men who carelessly toy with
young girls' affections ought
to be kicked by a horse and die!

52
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,770
Where'd that come from?

53
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,708
Still, I think any guy who's
like that probably does
deserve to die.

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,550
Hang on, why are you mad at me?

55
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:51,126
Here, I‐I will forgive you if
you would just hold my hand.

56
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:54,163
I see. So, that's it? Okay.

57
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:57,936
It would be bad if we got
separated in an unfamiliar
location.

58
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,838
So keep a tight grip!

59
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,577
Idiot.

60
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,747
Uh oh...

61
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,350
A‐Are they...?

62
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,952
They are...

63
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,621
They're holding...

64
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:13,624
[Cecilia] Holding hands...

65
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:17,963
I thought I was experiencing
a waking nightmare.

66
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,698
But if you see it...

67
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:23,470
Then it's time to kill him!

68
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,808
[Laura] Uh‐huh, you have
strange past‐times.

69
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:28,644
Laura!

70
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,947
[Laura] Oh, you do not need to
be so guarded.

71
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,751
Because it is no longer my
intent to harm any of you.

72
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,354
And you expect us to
believe you?!

73
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:38,858
Ah, I see.

74
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,360
[Rin] Hey, you wait just
a minute!

75
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,928
[Cecilia] Exactly what are
your intentions?

76
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:45,433
[Laura] It should be obvious.
I plan on joining them.

77
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,768
Nothing more.

78
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,170
Don't you know that you should
always spy...

79
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,774
on a new enemy before
confronting them openly?!

80
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:53,544
That's quite correct!
Surveillance is an art form!

81
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,213
First we must follow
them closely,

82
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,084
then we can determine the exact
nature of their relationship!

83
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,619
Mmhmm!

84
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,656
I see, you have a point.

85
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,969
[Ichika] Say, Charlotte...

86
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,270
Yes? What is it?

87
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,542
Everyone at the academy knows
that you're a girl now,

88
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,679
so it'd be normal for you to
go by "Charlotte."

89
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,683
Maybe I should think of
something else to call you, huh?

90
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,820
Something that's just
between you and me?

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,655
Huh? Really?

92
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,060
How about "Charl"?

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,831
That's easy to say,
and sounds friendly, right?

94
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,333
Charl!

95
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,569
Yeah, I think Charl
is wonderful!

96
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,605
Oh, okay then.

97
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:44,279
<i>Wow, that kind of reaction must</i>
<i>mean that she really does</i>
<i>like it. All right.</i>

98
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,116
<i>Charl... Charl!</i>

99
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:53,759
[Charlotte] <i>That means I must</i>
<i>be special to him,</i>
<i>n'est‐ce pas?</i>

100
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,877
[Charlotte] What is it, Ichika?
[Ichika] Sorry, would you mind
going on ahead for a
little while?

101
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,646
I just remembered there's
something else that I need
to buy.

102
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,516
[Charlotte] Something else
to buy?

103
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,719
Yeah, kind of.

104
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,157
[groaning]

105
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,693
[Ran] Hold on tight, bro.

106
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,761
If you drop any of those,
it's your head!

107
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,866
No matter what you're saying,
you're buyin' way too much.

108
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:27,004
The last summer of middle‐school
is special!

109
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,741
[Ran] Pool‐use swimsuit!
Beach‐use swimsuit!

110
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,577
"It's on!" swimsuit!
Ultra "It's on!" swimsuit!

111
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:34,780
Mega‐ultra "It's on!" swimsuit!

112
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,885
You need each kind to use as
the situation calls for!

113
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:39,987
Oh, what kind of
situations are those?

114
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,725
Huh?
Wah!

115
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,130
Hey buddy, doing some shopping?

116
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:47,865
Oh, yeah.

117
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:49,935
That's quite a load
you've got there.

118
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,803
Are all those bags
full of swimsuits?

119
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,209
[Dan] Yeah, the runt here said
that she was gonna show
them all off to ya‐

120
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,113
What was that?

121
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,950
What was that? Um...

122
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,119
So, did you come to buy a
swimsuit, too?

123
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,457
[Ichika] Yeah, our school's
class beach trip is coming
up soon.

124
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:10,028
If I'd known that before, you'd
have been able to help me
with shopping!

125
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,398
[Ichika] What?
[Ran] Nothing at all!

126
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,101
Oh, that's right,
I almost forgot!

127
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,804
Next year, you're going
to be my upperclassman!

128
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:17,939
[Ran] Isn't it great?!

129
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,875
You're applying to the
IS Academy?

130
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,944
Mmhmm! My first choice.

131
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,380
So, I'll see you there, right?

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,785
Yeah, I guess so! Study hard
for your entrance exam!

133
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,288
Okay, I will!
Thank you very much!

134
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:33,360
Um, let's see now, where did my
brother get to? Uh...

135
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,296
Ichika! Come with me!

136
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:39,435
Wow, he really is useless as
an older brother.

137
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,369
Where's Ichika?

138
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,705
Huh?

139
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:45,743
[Ichika] Wait! The sign says
"No shoes!"

140
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,380
Now why'd you drag me in here?

141
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Because I want to know if the
swimsuit I chose looks good.

142
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,688
And for that I had to
come in here with you?!

143
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,391
Sssh!

144
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:00,396
Now, where could they have
disappeared to?

145
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:03,267
Surely they can't have noticed
us following them!

146
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,002
They can't!

147
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,339
[clerk] Oh, and here's this
year's featured suit!

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,944
[clerk] It's called the
"Ultimate Cleavage Model."
[Laura] These are all swimsuits?

149
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:14,249
I never had any idea so many
different types existed.

150
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,852
[girl 1] It's so hard to
choose, isn't it?

151
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:18,955
Yeah, if you wear one that
doesn't suit you exactly,

152
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:21,024
your man will turn on you
like that!

153
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:23,027
And even if everything else
is perfect,

154
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,431
if your swimsuit is bad,
then that's the kiss of
death for sure!

155
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,033
[bang]

156
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,737
[Charlotte] <i>If anyone spots us,</i>
<i>they will get in the way!</i>

157
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,708
[Ichika] Uh, are you looking
at someone out there?

158
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:35,944
No! No, no one is there!

159
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:38,915
But you just stay in here and
I will get changed quickly.

160
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:45,557
[Charlotte] <i>I made all this</i>
<i>happen, but now what am I</i>
<i>supposed to do?</i>

161
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,795
[Ichika] <i>What's going on?</i>
<i>What does Charl want to do?</i>

162
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,165
<i>I don't get this!</i>
<i>I don't get this at all!</i>

163
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:53,935
[Charlotte] <i>Oh, enough!</i>
<i>I'm doing it!</i>

164
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,941
<i>She's really taking her</i>
<i>clothes off!</i>

165
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,878
<i>No! Bad Ichika! You must not</i>
<i>imagine it!</i>

166
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,851
<i>Think of something else!</i>

167
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,555
<i>Uh, I know! Pi!</i>

168
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,960
<i>Pi equals 3.141592...</i>

169
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,869
<i>653589793238462643‐</i>

170
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,972
Okay, I'm done.

171
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,257
So... bad?

172
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,961
Oh no! Not at all!
I think it's really great!

173
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:38,162
And I mean that!

174
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,065
Okay, then I'll get this one.

175
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,902
[clerk] Uh, excuse me Miss?

176
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,906
Wait a second, was that...

177
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:47,741
Aah!

178
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:50,879
O‐O‐Orimura and Dunois
changing together?!

179
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,883
What are you two doing?

180
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,019
[Maya] Now listen up!

181
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,955
Even though the two of
you are classmates,

182
00:10:58,055 --> 00:10:59,992
certain lines have to be drawn!

183
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,396
Boys and girls must not enter
changing rooms together!

184
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,734
[Cecilia] I never thought
that the teachers would
be here at the shop.

185
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,306
[Rinin] Yeah, it could get
really sticky if we rushed
things now.

186
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:13,310
[ringing]

187
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,814
Clarissa, I need your help.
We have an emergency situation!

188
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:19,117
[Clarissa] Captain
Laura Bodewig,

189
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,521
are you experiencing a problem?

190
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:25,893
[Laura] Ja, it's regarding that
Ichika Orimura I mentioned to
you before.

191
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:29,064
Ah, Instructor Orimura's
younger brother.

192
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:31,534
This is the boy for whom
you have affections?

193
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:37,175
[Laura] Jawohl. He is the same
one you kindly informed me I
should refer to as my bride!

194
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:42,349
It so happens that all students
from the IS Academy are about to
take a trip to the beach.

195
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:47,356
I am unclear as to what basis
for selection is when it comes
to the correct swim attire.

196
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,892
Therefore, I am requesting
proper instruction.

197
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:55,132
Ja, of course. The Black Hare
Corps is here to assist you
in this matter.

198
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:59,037
Incidentally, what are you
currently equipped with?

199
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:02,809
[Laura] I have a single,
school‐issue swimsuit.

200
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,445
[Clarissa] What foolishness
is that?!

201
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:08,217
The IS Academy uses old‐style
school swimsuits,

202
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:10,653
and while I normally approve of
tradition, in that suit...

203
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,591
In that suit...?

204
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,495
No naughty bits will show!

205
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,831
That's the XO of the
Black Hare Corps for you!

206
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:22,804
[girl] Her love of Japanese
manga and anime isn't just
for show!

207
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:25,140
[Laura] So, what do I do now?

208
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,961
I have a trick up my sleeve...

209
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,312
[Maya] It's 11:00 right
now, everyone!

210
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,583
You're free to do what you want
until sunset, okay?

211
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,988
Just make sure to get back
to the guest house in time
for dinner.

212
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:50,958
You got that?

213
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:56,999
Hey, Orimu, do you want to
play volleyball with us?
It'll be fun!

214
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,734
Volleyball's awesome.

215
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,203
Sure, sound's fun!

216
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,107
Wow, I'm up so high!

217
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,809
[Rinin] I can see really far!

218
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,513
[Ichika] What are you doing?
Do you think you're some kind
of cat?

219
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:08,782
Oh, that looks like fun!

220
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,918
When you're done with her,
I wanna ride you next, okay?

221
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:12,520
And it's my turn next!

222
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,524
[Ichika] I'm not an observation
deck! Get off me already!

223
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,094
Say, what the devil
is going on here?!

224
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:21,732
I think that it's obvious.
He's my lookout tower.

225
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, Ichika! Surely you can't
have already forgotten the
promise you made to me on
the bus?

226
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:35,684
All right then Ichika,
please get on with it.

227
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:38,187
And exactly what is he supposed
to be getting on?!

228
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:41,592
As you can see, he is to rub
suntan oil on my skin.

229
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:46,966
[Cecilia] It simply wouldn't do
for a gentleman to renege on a
promise he's made to a lady,
now would it?

230
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,169
All right then, if I must.

231
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,707
Yech...

232
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:00,618
Eep!

233
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,254
My goodness Ichika!

234
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:04,623
Warm your hands a bit before
applying the oil!

235
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:08,696
I'm sorry, but it's my first
time doing this, you know?

236
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:11,432
You mean that I'm going to be
your first time?

237
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,203
Well then, it's to be expected
I suppose.

238
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,573
Said the hungry spider
to the fly.

239
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:26,152
[Nohohon] That looks like it
feels so good.

240
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,590
[girl] E‐Even my heart is
starting to pound.

241
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,495
[Tanimoto] Cecilia, lend me that
suntan oil when you're done
using it, okay?

242
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:36,233
You just want me to do
your back, right?

243
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,636
No, there are many areas that
I can't reach.

244
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:41,473
So, while I have you here, I'd
like you to cover all of them.

245
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:42,441
All of them?!

246
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,643
Yes, please!

247
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:44,644
My legs,

248
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:45,813
my thighs,

249
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,415
and my buttocks.

250
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:51,320
Hey there, I'll do that for ya!

251
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,989
[Rinin] Here, here, here!
[giggling]

252
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,825
[Cecilia] Ah! That tickles!
[Rinin] Here! I've got
you covered!

253
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,861
[Rinin] And you wanted some
rubbed on here, too, didn't you?

254
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,165
Okie‐dokie! And we'll just
grease the rest of this down
while we're at it.

255
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:03,903
And "oops", missed a place,
right here!

256
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,341
Dammit Rin, that is
quite enough!

257
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,412
[screaming]

258
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,857
Dammit, I didn't do anything
wrong, so why did she have
to hit me?

259
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,761
Ichika, let's have a race
to that buoy over there!

260
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,531
If you lose, you have to buy me
some shaved ice!

261
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,301
What?! Where do you get off‐?

262
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:29,905
Hey, hang on! That's not fair!

263
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:34,178
<i>Okay, that was a horrible thing</i>
<i>I did to Cecilia,</i>

264
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:35,947
<i>but I need her out of the way.</i>

265
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,852
<i>I couldn't stand the thought</i>
<i>of losing to her or Laura!</i>

266
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,724
<i>My leg!</i>

267
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,198
My leg is‐!

268
00:15:58,244 --> 00:15:59,779
<i>Rin!</i>

269
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,058
[Rinin] <i>Ichika...</i>

270
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,261
<i>This is Ichika's arm.</i>

271
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,732
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

272
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:19,205
[Ichika] Can you breathe?
Are you okay?!

273
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,408
[Rinin] Yeah, I'll be fine.

274
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,112
That was quite
catastrophic, Rin.

275
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:27,150
I should escort you back to the
guest house straight away.

276
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,954
Huh? No, wait,
maybe Ichika can‐

277
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,892
Excuse me, Takatsuki, would you
be willing to lend a hand here?

278
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,062
Sure, I'm happy to help.

279
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:41,735
[bickering]

280
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,037
[Rinin] Ichika!

281
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,975
Well, if she's that energetic,
she probably is all right.

282
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,812
[Charlotte] Ichika, so this is
where you've been!

283
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:53,418
So uh, what's the deal with that
beach mummy?

284
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:56,089
Come on now, you can let Ichika
see your suit.

285
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,657
It will be all right.

286
00:16:57,757 --> 00:17:00,395
[Laura] Nein! I will decide
whether or not it is all right!

287
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,363
Wait a second!
Is that Laura's voice?

288
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,566
But Laura, you have
already changed,

289
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,869
so now you have to show him
your new bathing suit.

290
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,843
No, wait! I am still not ready.
First, I must prepare myself
for this.

291
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:16,850
[Charlotte] Oh? In that case,
Ichika and I will go out to
the shore alone.

292
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,085
Are you okay with that?

293
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:20,655
[Laura] No! That is forbidden!

294
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,899
I‐If you wish to laugh,
then go ahead!

295
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:32,171
It looks perfectly fine,
don't you think, Ichika?

296
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,741
Yeah, you look cute.

297
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,977
Oh! You think I am cute?

298
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:39,681
That is the first time I have
been called that.

299
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:43,353
I thank you very much for
your input and it is
greatly appreciated.

300
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:46,390
[girl] Orimura!
[Tanimoto] You promised.

301
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,192
[Tanimoto] Now let's play
some beach volleyball!

302
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:52,198
[Nohohon] Yeah! It's a battle
against Orimu! Zap, bang, pow!

303
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,568
[Tanimoto] Here! Catch!

304
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,219
An even three‐against‐three.

305
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,288
All right, let's do it!

306
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:02,292
[girls] Do your best, Orimura!

307
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:05,262
You too, Dunois!

308
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:09,836
They call me the Summer Devil
of July. Behold my power!
[♪]

309
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,572
I've got it!

310
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,777
Nice save, Charl!

311
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:19,849
Wow!

312
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:22,285
Hiii‐ya!

313
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,587
I'm cute...

314
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,289
I can't believe he called
me cute!

315
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,758
[Ichika] Laura!

316
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:33,267
[Ichika] Are you okay?
[Charlotte] Can you speak?

317
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:36,872
He... said... I'm cute...

318
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,943
That made me feel so...

319
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:44,783
[Charlotte] Are you still
embarrassed about that?

320
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,452
Laura?

321
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:48,721
[screaming]

322
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,592
What's up with her?

323
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,394
Should we go after her?

324
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:56,231
Oh, I think we should probably
leave her alone.

325
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:58,902
[Maya] Oh, who brought
the volleyballs?

326
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,471
That looks like fun.

327
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,707
Would you like to come play
with us, teacher?

328
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:03,876
[Maya] Sure!

329
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,980
You want to give the kids a
shot, Miss Orimura?

330
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:13,755
[girls in awe]

331
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,926
Miss Orimura looks like
a swimsuit model.

332
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:18,361
She's so awesome!

333
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,733
[Tanimoto] Please go ahead,
ma'am. I'll trade places
with you.

334
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,467
What the hell?

335
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,570
Okay! Let's do it!

336
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:30,512
[Charlotte] Uh, Ichika,
I was wondering...

337
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:34,450
Could it be that Miss Orimura
is your type?

338
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,052
What does that mean?!

339
00:19:36,152 --> 00:19:39,390
Well, your reaction just now was
certainly a lot different...

340
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,693
than from when you
saw our swimsuits.

341
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,796
Nope, nope.
That's not it at all.

342
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:47,701
Sacre bleu! So many
rivals already.

343
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,839
Now I have to compete with Miss
Orimura on top of all that?

344
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:55,578
[Ichika] No kidding. Chifuyu's a
major badass volleyball player.

345
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,551
Ichika, you've probably got
the wrong idea.

346
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:02,287
Right! Serve's up!

347
00:20:02,388 --> 00:21:02,902
[♪]

348
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,393
[Chifuyu] So, this is where
you've been hiding.

349
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:24,231
The ocean's not going anywhere
so, can you give me
your attention?

350
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:26,101
[Houki] Yes, Miss Orimura?

351
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:30,407
[Chifuyu] You've seemed
distracted for a while now.

352
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,042
Do you want to talk about it?

353
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:35,847
Well it's...

354
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:39,218
[Chifuyu] Is it about Tabane?

355
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,689
I contacted her the other day.

356
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:46,361
It seems that she had nothing
to do with what happened with
Laura's VT System.

357
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:48,764
I see.

358
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,768
Tomorrow is July 7.

359
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,741
You're expecting that something
might show up, aren't you?

360
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:00,677
[Tanabe] <i>Of course I have</i>
<i>one ready.</i>

361
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,177
<i>It's over spec,</i>
<i>with high‐end capabilities.</i>

362
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:06,344
<i>It'll stand toe‐to‐toe with</i>
<i>the Byaku! Mmhmm!</i>

363
00:22:06,444 --> 00:22:08,477
<i>This IS unit is known as...</i>

364
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,644
Akatsubaki.

365
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:53,644
[girl 1] Hold on! Just wait a
minute! Who the heck is that?!

366
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,711
[girl 2] Wearing a frilly dress
and rabbit ears...?

367
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,711
That certainly makes one heck
of an impression!

368
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,377
[girl 3] So, her coming
here means an important IS
official's arrived, right?

369
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:05,277
[girl 1] Hey, it looks like she
brought some kind of present for
Miss Shinonono!

370
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,177
[girl 2] Whoa! But there's no
time to be surprised about that!

371
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,811
Because some other unexpected
news has just come in!

372
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,977
[girl 3] The next episode:
"Thin Red Line"

373
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,611
[girl 1] Our pleasant beach
excursion is about to...

374
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:18,044
[girl 2] suddenly become
completely crazy!
