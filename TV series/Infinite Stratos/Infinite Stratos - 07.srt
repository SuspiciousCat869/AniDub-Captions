1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,643
[girl 1] <i>No way!
Are you serious?</i>

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,950
No! That can't possibly be true!

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,120
You better not be lying to us!

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,655
I'm telling you the truth!

5
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,426
In fact, everyone in the whole
school is talking about it!

6
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:22,463
[Aikawa] The deal is,
whoever wins first place
in the tournament...

7
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:26,536
is going to get to date Orimura.
It's true, I swear!

8
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:29,473
Do you mean to tell me
that Ichika actually
knows about this?

9
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:33,177
Well, confidentially, it seems
like he doesn't know much
about it.

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,612
[Rinin] What does that mean?

11
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:36,081
[girl 2] Well, supposedly,
this decision was made...

12
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,717
entirely by the girls.

13
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:40,187
[Ichika] Good morning!

14
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:42,490
So, what are you ladies
talking about?

15
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,394
[screaming]

16
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,265
Well, I'd better head back
to my own class now.

17
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:52,070
Right, I should go.
Ta‐ta, see you later.

18
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,507
What was that?

19
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,243
Who knows...?

20
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,644
<i>Why?</i>

21
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,082
[Houki] If I win
the tournament...

22
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:43,986
you have to date me!

23
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:45,888
<i>How did that turn into this?</i>

24
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,892
The deal is, whoever wins first
place in the tournament...

25
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:52,364
is going to get to date Orimura.
It's true, I swear!

26
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,335
<i>How could it become</i>
<i>a rumor like that?</i>

27
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:01,610
The winner of the tournament
only gets to date Ichika
if it's me!

28
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,350
[Houki] <i>Anyway, it won't be</i>
<i>a problem as long as I'm</i>
<i>the winner.</i>

29
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,819
<i>If I'm the winner...</i>

30
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,321
<i>it'll be fine.</i>

31
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,691
<i>This time is going to be</i>
<i>different from back then.</i>

32
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:14,961
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

33
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,564
<i>It should be fine.</i>

34
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,538
[Houki] <i>I was in the fourth</i>
<i>grade when it happened.</i>

35
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:24,775
<i>The national kendo</i>
<i>championship...</i>

36
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,244
<i>Everyone said I was going</i>
<i>to win it,</i>

37
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:31,216
<i>but I wasn't able to attend the</i>
<i>match, so I lost by default.</i>

38
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,851
<i>And the reason I couldn't</i>
<i>make it...</i>

39
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,222
<i>was because my sister</i>
<i>had announced the IS.</i>

40
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:38,994
<i>Because it was so powerful</i>
<i>and could be used for so</i>
<i>many things,</i>

41
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,830
<i>the government was afraid that</i>
<i>it could be used as a weapon.</i>

42
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,766
<i>So, they put us into</i>
<i>a protection program,</i>

43
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,704
<i>moving my family from</i>
<i>place to place in secret.</i>

44
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:50,542
<i>Before I knew it, I was</i>
<i>living separately from</i>
<i>my parents...</i>

45
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,079
<i>and I didn't even know</i>
<i>where my sister was.</i>

46
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,517
<i>And they kept interviewing me,</i>
<i>I don't know how many times,</i>

47
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,421
<i>while keeping me under</i>
<i>constant surveillance.</i>

48
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,225
<i>How could someone not</i>
<i>be scarred by that?</i>

49
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,927
<i>Physically and mentally?</i>

50
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:06,096
<i>But I never stopped my</i>
<i>kendo training,</i>

51
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:10,502
<i>because it was the only</i>
<i>connection I still had</i>
<i>with Ichika.</i>

52
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,706
<i>But on that day,</i>
<i>the way I was...</i>

53
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:18,346
<i>Swordsmanship is a mirror.</i>
<i>One that reflects your</i>
<i>true self.</i>

54
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:23,787
<i>I was actually practicing kendo</i>
<i>just so I could beat up my</i>
<i>opponents and vent my feelings.</i>

55
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:27,091
<i>It wasn't about strength</i>
<i>or skill.</i>

56
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,662
<i>It was raw violence and rage.</i>

57
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:33,199
<i>That was not the true</i>
<i>definition of strength.</i>

58
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:36,103
<i>I let my dark side consume me.</i>

59
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:40,109
<i>And now I have to wonder,</i>
<i>can I win this time?</i>

60
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:44,848
<i>And can I do it without</i>
<i>betraying myself in</i>
<i>the process?</i>

61
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,517
<i>I have to!</i>

62
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,127
[Cecilia] What's this?

63
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,498
Up at the crack of dawn, I see.

64
00:04:56,598 --> 00:05:00,168
And here I was thinking that
I was going to be the first
one to arrive.

65
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:04,374
I'm here for a little extra to
training so I can beat losers
like you in the tournament.

66
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,710
What are you doing here?

67
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,614
The same as you, actually.
Except I'll win.

68
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,585
You want to back up
that fat mouth?

69
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:15,924
As in we just go ahead and see
who's really the best right now.

70
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,158
That's fine with me.

71
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,895
Why don't we have a proper
contest to sort this out?

72
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:23,099
And then we'll find out who is
stronger and more elegant.

73
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,140
Agreed. Although, it's obvious
I'm better than you on
all accounts.

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,643
You know, I've always heard that
a little dog's bark...

75
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,246
is much worse than its bite.

76
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,748
[Rinin] And just what
does that mean?

77
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,883
Just pointing out how your
pointless attempts...

78
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,420
to exaggerate your minimal
abilities have failed.

79
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,657
But that's to be expected.

80
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,025
[Rinin] Is that so?

81
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,163
Well I could say the same
thing about you!

82
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,153
[bang]

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,799
[Rinin] That's a German
third‐generation model,
the Schwarzer Roegen!

84
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,734
Laura Bodewig, you swine!

85
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:19,375
What's your issue?!
You shoot at China's rep and
you'll get back a world of hurt!

86
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,512
[Laura] So, China's Shenlong...

87
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:25,483
and England's Blue Tears, ja?

88
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:29,422
They appeared to be much
stronger when I was only
looking at the data.

89
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,959
What's that? Oh wait,
now I understand.

90
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,961
You're itching for a
heiny kicking...

91
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,364
and you came all the way here
so we could serve yours up on
a platter!

92
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:40,370
[Rinin] Are you a masochist? Or
is that what you do for fun back
in the potato fields?

93
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,139
Now, now, Miss Rinin.

94
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,209
It would seem that our new
playmate doesn't speak a
civilized language.

95
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:49,249
And it's not nice to tease
someone so intellectually
handicapped.

96
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,553
My God, I can't believe
it's true.

97
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:56,424
To think people like you have
third‐generation type machines
like mine.

98
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,495
[Laura] A country that's about
cheap, ridiculous quantity..

99
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,966
and one that's about stale,
old traditions...

100
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,235
They must be extremely
short‐handed.

101
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:07,539
Does it sound like
someone's asking to be
turned into scrap metal?!

102
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,677
It would seem like
that's the case.

103
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,546
[Laura] Do you want to come
at me together?

104
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,115
It's impossible that
I would lose...

105
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:18,087
to two mares fighting over that
gelded pony of a stallion.

106
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,991
I don't know what you heard,
but that sounded a lot like,

107
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,995
"Come and beat my stupid German
ass senseless" to me!

108
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,166
Trust it to a German to
disrespect someone who's
not present!

109
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:31,371
However, I'll happily teach you
the flaws in your manners
and technology!

110
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:33,975
Do your worst!

111
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,278
[Rinin] Fine!
[Cecilia] With pleasure!

112
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,151
[Charles] So, Ichika, you're
going to train today,
aren't you?

113
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:44,889
Yeah, there's not much time
left before the tournament.

114
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,592
[girl] Three representative
contenders...

115
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,229
are having a practice match
in the third arena!

116
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:58,542
Houki...

117
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,010
[boom]

118
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,686
[Charles] That's Miss Fan
and Miss Alcott!

119
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,089
[Houki] And Laura Bodewig...

120
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,492
What are they doing?
They're nuts!

121
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,997
Take that!

122
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:20,204
Nice try, but useless against
my Schwarzer Roegen's
Canceling Barrier!

123
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,743
How did she to stop the
Ryuho's attack?!

124
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,179
It's an A. I. C.

125
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,315
Of course, and because she's
equipped with one,

126
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,352
she didn't even need to attempt
to evade the Ryuho.

127
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,989
A.I.C.? What does that mean?

128
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,926
A.I.C. stands for Active
Inertial Canceller.

129
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,262
The Schwarzer Roegen's
third‐generation weapon...

130
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:42,834
Which, as the name implies,
cancels all inertia.

131
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:47,674
You understood that, right?

132
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,845
I saw it;
that's more than enough.

133
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,289
I can't believe we're
this incompatible!

134
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:10,504
To call something with that kind
of finishing a third‐generation
weapon is a joke.

135
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,523
You don't seem to be moving!

136
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,793
You either!

137
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:32,968
[screaming]

138
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,887
So naive...

139
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,290
Why would you apply a heavy
air‐pressurizing weapon...

140
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,393
in that situation?

141
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,947
Okay, you just fired a
missile at point blank range!

142
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,582
You do know that's nuts, right?

143
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,018
You can complain later,

144
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:13,288
but that tactic is guaranteed
to cause major damage.

145
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,591
[Rinin] Huh? What the‐?!

146
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,067
Are you finished?

147
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,104
All right then, must be my
turn now.

148
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:44,564
[alarm]

149
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:48,536
Sacrebleu! The shield energy
won't hold out much longer
at this rate!

150
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:52,040
[Ichika] And that's bad.
[Houki] Worse, if the damage
doesn't stop,

151
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,143
[Houki] the IS mandatory
unlocks activate,

152
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:56,413
and in this state,
that could kill them!

153
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,297
[Ichika] Laura, stop it!

154
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,066
Stop it!

155
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,339
Damn you!

156
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:32,094
[Charles] Ichika!
[Houki] Ichika!

157
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:37,068
Get your hands off of them,
you bitch!

158
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,807
<i>Wh‐What is this?</i>

159
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,476
<i>I can't move my body!</i>

160
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,346
<i>I'm totally frozen!</i>

161
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:51,988
A linear thinker who's
too emotional...

162
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:55,125
I've never seen a more
perfect example of a fool.

163
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:58,463
Just as I had suspected.

164
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:01,300
You pose no actual threat
to me and Schwarzer Roegen.

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,770
You're just another of
the helpless masses.

166
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,373
[Laura] Now, be gone!

167
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,576
[gunfire]

168
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:11,146
[Charles] Ichika, get out!

169
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,751
Damn you!

170
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,755
Hang on, ladies!

171
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:24,598
[alarm]

172
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,205
<i>Please, Byakushiki, let me</i>
<i>use the ignition boost just</i>
<i>one more time!</i>

173
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,353
[Ichika] So, are you guys okay?

174
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:43,056
Ichika...

175
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:46,694
I'm so sorry you had to witness
any of that atrocity.

176
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:50,533
No problem. I'm just glad both
of you are conscious.

177
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,470
If only I had my own IS...

178
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,607
Instead the only thing I can do
is stand here and watch!

179
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:10,360
Now fool, I'll show you the
real difference between
the generations.

180
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,199
Hyah!

181
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,608
Mentor!

182
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,180
Honestly, this is why dealing
with children is so damn tiring.

183
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,150
Man, Sis has still got it!

184
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,923
You can practice all
you want here,

185
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:37,963
however, as a teacher I can't
ignore it when you start
destroying the barriers
in the arena itself.

186
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:39,465
[Chifuyu] So this is over now.

187
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,401
I'm ordering you to wait for the
upcoming tournament...

188
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:44,338
to settle the score of your
little match, understood?

189
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,875
If those are your
orders, Mentor.

190
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,951
Orimura, Dunois, you're okay
with that too, right?

191
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:55,353
Uh... yeah, sure.

192
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,957
You should say "Yes" to your
instructor, blockhead!

193
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,826
Uh... Yes ma'am!

194
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,129
That is an acceptable
compromise.

195
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:10,073
In that case, you are all
prohibited from engaging
in ny personal matches
until the tournament!

196
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,143
Dismissed!

197
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,889
It wasn't necessary for you
to help me back there.

198
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:25,293
We would surely have won if we'd
only been permitted to finish.

199
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,963
In your dreams maybe...

200
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,599
Stop putting on a front,
you two.

201
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:30,768
Putting on a front?

202
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,903
You are embarrassed because
someone you like...

203
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,138
saw you when you were losing.

204
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:35,674
That is correct, no?

205
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,410
Huh? What?

206
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,781
I promise you, I have absolutely
no idea what he's talking about!
Cross my heart!

207
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:45,253
Uh... I'm confused as well!
I mean, I'm not putting on
any sort of front either.

208
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:49,693
[Ichika] Hold on, how does
that connect with you two
starting that fight with
Laura in the first place?

209
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,364
Um... it was because...

210
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:56,635
Well, it's rather,
how should I put it?

211
00:14:57,937 --> 00:15:02,343
It's basically because she
disrespected our female pride.

212
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,650
Ah ha! You mean Ichika is
someone who you‐

213
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,387
You certainly do seem to have
a lot to say, don't you?

214
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:13,591
Way too much to say!
I couldn't agree with you more!

215
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:14,659
Now cut it out!

216
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,329
You two are moving around
way too much...

217
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,964
for injured people anyway.

218
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,371
[Ichika] Yeah, you see?
You're obviously still
in major pain.

219
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,841
So don't push it.
That'd be just foolish.

220
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:28,411
Who's foolish?! Who are you
calling foolish, fool?!

221
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,614
You're the biggest
fool here, Ichika!

222
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:33,352
Yeah, you big dumbity‐dumb head!

223
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:35,821
Geez, is this a girl thing?

224
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:38,892
[rumble]

225
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:40,895
[girls] Orimura! Dunois!

226
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:42,497
Uh, what's happening?

227
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,767
Yes, what is the meaning
of this?

228
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,435
[in unison] Look!

229
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:50,541
What is this?

230
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:53,444
"In order for us to conduct
the most practical
simulated matches,"

231
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:59,787
"all of those participating in
this month's IS tournament
will be required to form
two member teams."

232
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,824
[Ichika] "However, for those who
are unable to establish teams
on their own,"

233
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:05,528
"their partners will be
chosen by a random drawing."

234
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,230
"The registration
deadline is..."

235
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,866
[Aikawa] You should just team
up with me, Orimura!
[Ichika] Huh?!

236
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,370
[girl 1] Please be my
partner, Dunois!
[Charles] Uh...

237
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,073
[girls pleading]

238
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,778
I'm very sorry, but I'm teaming
up with Charles, so forget it.

239
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,615
[girl 2] Well, if that's
the case...

240
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:23,385
[girl 3] I suppose it's okay
if two guys are teaming up.

241
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,221
[girl 4] Actually,
I think it's hot!

242
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:28,125
Hey, listen, Ichika I‐

243
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,527
Hey, you've got to
be on my team!

244
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,195
We're childhood friends,
aren't we?

245
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:34,266
No, he should pick me! He should
team with his classmate, right?

246
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,002
You can't do that.

247
00:16:36,102 --> 00:16:40,107
I'm afraid the damage reading
on both your IS units is
above level C.

248
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,878
That means you won't be
participating in the tournament.

249
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:45,614
No way! I can fight just fine,
Miss Yamada!

250
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,918
I just don't understand what
you're on about!

251
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:49,887
I said no and that is final!

252
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:52,958
Besides, if you don't get
those repairs taken care
of right away,

253
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:56,496
it's going to lead to even worse
problems in the long run!

254
00:16:56,596 --> 00:17:01,135
<i>But, whoever wins the</i>
<i>tournament will get to</i>
<i>date Ichika, isn't that</i>
<i>how it works?</i>

255
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:04,974
<i>Yes, we must prevent that from</i>
<i>happening no matter what</i>
<i>it takes!</i>

256
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,445
[in unison] <i>So, that means the</i>
<i>winner must be...</i>

257
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,785
Now listen up, you two!
You have to win!

258
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:15,522
I want you both to go out there
and give it all you've got!

259
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,557
Remember, you're doing it for
us as well!

260
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,627
Uh, right, you bet ya!

261
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:25,435
Yes, of course. And I promise
that we shall do our best to
meet your expectations.

262
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:28,038
You have such a
beautiful friendship...

263
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,178
[Charles] Uh, I was
wondering, Ichika...

264
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:34,380
Uh huh?

265
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,318
I, uh, know I'm late
saying this,

266
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:40,322
but thank you for helping
me back there.

267
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:41,690
[Ichika] Did I do something?

268
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,459
[Charles] You know,
at the nurse's office.

269
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,663
You told them that we
were pairing up for the
tournament, remember?

270
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,933
I was really happy when
you did that.

271
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,501
[Ichika] Oh, that?

272
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,404
Yeah, I guessed it would
be a problem...

273
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,740
if you paired with
someone else...

274
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,475
and she found out that
you're really a girl.

275
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,878
[Charles] You're
so sweet, Ichika.

276
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,714
Oh, you think so?

277
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:01,083
Uh huh.

278
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,794
You know, I don't think you have
to keep talking like a guy when
it's just the two of us alone
together.

279
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:12,164
[Charles] I understand
what you mean, however,

280
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:16,603
the problem is, I took so much
intensive training on how to
act and speak like a boy,

281
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,339
and I've been doing it so long,

282
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,976
that now I find it's kind
of hard to stop.

283
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,945
Oh, I see...

284
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:25,716
But if it is really
bothering you,

285
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,789
then I will try my best to talk
more like a girl, when the two
of us are alone together.

286
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,592
You don't have to force
yourself like that.

287
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:36,330
Besides, when you talk like
a boy, I actually think
it's kind of cute.

288
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,534
Kind of cute? Do you...

289
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,570
really mean that?

290
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,741
I said it, I meant it.

291
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:48,279
Maybe I will not try
that hard, then.

292
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,851
Okay, so, I guess it's time
to get ready for bed now.

293
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:55,656
Oh, sorry, I'll just
step outside.

294
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:59,528
No, wait. It's... It's all
right and not fair to you.

295
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:03,900
And I... I don't even
really mind.

296
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,839
Okay, the thing is,
I actually do mind.

297
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,043
But if we're supposed to
be guys, the others might
get suspicious...

298
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:14,047
if they see you waiting outside
while I am changing.

299
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,819
You have a point.

300
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,890
Then, how about we just face
away from each other when
we change?

301
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,625
[Charles] That sounds good
to me.

302
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,762
Right... Let's do this.

303
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,205
[Charles] Woah!
[thud]

304
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,007
Oh, ow!

305
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,578
My leg got caught...

306
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:38,146
Ah!

307
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:43,820
Ah... ah... aah!

308
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:47,225
[Ichika] Don't you dare scream!

309
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:54,034
[scream]

310
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:56,037
Guh‐!

311
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:22,072
I must be honest, you are much
more forceful than I expected,
Ichika.

312
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:26,077
If you would have just asked,
I would have gladly...

313
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,718
<i>Let's just go to bed, oui!</i>

314
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:38,293
What if you just stay here?

315
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:44,168
<i>At that moment, I felt like</i>
<i>I was actually wanted...</i>

316
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,938
<i>by someone for the very</i>
<i>first time.</i>

317
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,955
Bon nuit, Ichika.

318
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:14,609
[Ichika] Wow, this is
really something, huh?

319
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:18,614
[Charles] Oh, some of those
are recruiters here to watch
the seniors,

320
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:23,721
and the others are here to
see how much the sophomores
have learned after a year
of training.

321
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:28,027
[Ichika] Well, I take my hat
off to them.

322
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:30,363
<i>I wonder who Houki decided</i>
<i>to pair up with?</i>

323
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:32,599
<i>They said they were going to</i>
<i>assign a partner by drawing...</i>

324
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,201
<i>if you didn't choose</i>
<i>one yourself.</i>

325
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:36,471
I guess that the only thing
you care about right now...

326
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,507
is the match against
Miss Bodewig.

327
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,246
Hm? Uh, oh, yeah. I suppose so.

328
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,549
Try not to get too emotional
out there.

329
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:49,589
In the entire freshman class,
I believe she is by far the
most powerful.

330
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:52,793
Mmhmm. She is.
And the most psycho.

331
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:56,803
Look, they're about to post
the first matches.

332
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,413
[Houki] <i>What in the hell are</i>
<i>they trying to do?</i>

333
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,013
<i>That's the worst match</i>
<i>up possible...</i>

334
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,646
[girl 1] At last, the fateful
battle is finally about
to begin!

335
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:57,713
[girl 2] It's a team match and
the whole audience is going to
go wild!

336
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,146
[girl 3] Yeah, but all four of
the contestants are from the
same class!

337
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:03,613
That means I'm still trying to
figure out which team I'm
going to root for!

338
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,179
[girl 1] Well, I'll be
supporting Team Orimura!

339
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,779
[girl 2] All right then, I'll be
cheering for Team Dunois!

340
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,746
[girl 3] Hey, they're both
on the same team!

341
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:13,879
[girl 1] The next episode:
"Find Out My Mind"

342
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:17,779
[girl 2] The soulful gong,
it now rings out!
