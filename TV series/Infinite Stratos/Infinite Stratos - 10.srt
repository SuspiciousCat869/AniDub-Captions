1
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,957
Fresh wasabi is great!
It's the real deal!

2
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,026
The "real deal?"

3
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,538
H‐Hey there, how're ya
doing, Charl?

4
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:39,041
I feel okay, thanks...

5
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:41,977
It was particularly flavorful
and delicious...

6
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:45,581
Oh man, I thought you knew
better than to do something
like that.

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,954
Are you feeling all right?

8
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,356
If you can't kneel for
a long time,

9
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,624
maybe you should move to
a table instead?

10
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:59,095
I'm quite all right!

11
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:03,800
And compared to the effort it
took to secure this place at
the table, this is nothing!

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,170
[Ichika] This place?
[Ceclia] Uh, it's nothing
at all! Honestly!

13
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,538
[nervous laughter]

14
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:09,739
[Charlotte] Ichika!

15
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,909
There are many different types
of girls, you know.

16
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,844
Oh, is that so?

17
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,547
[Charlotte] Yes, it is so.

18
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:20,818
[Ichika] <i>Oh man, check</i>
<i>out the face on Houki...</i>

19
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:24,254
<i>I wonder what she could be</i>
<i>looking so upset about?</i>

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,964
Hey, Cecilia, if it's really
that uncomfortable, do you
want me to feed you?

21
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:35,300
I've done it for Charl‐

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,936
[Charlotte] Ichika!
[Ichika] Sorry.

23
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,637
[Cecilia] Do you really mean it?

24
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,774
Do you really mean that you
would actually be willing
to feed me?

25
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:43,942
[Ichika] Honestly?

26
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,510
It would be an awful shame...

27
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,414
to let all this beauitful food
go to waste now wouldn't it?

28
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:50,416
[Ichika] Okay, sashimi first.

29
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:53,719
[Cecilia] Oh, right! But not too
much wasabi, if you please.

30
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,187
[Ichika] Right.

31
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:58,857
All righty!

32
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,192
[in unison] Aaah!

33
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:03,029
[girl] Aw! Cecilia's so mean!

34
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,064
She's having Orimura feed her!

35
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:08,267
[girls complaining]

36
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:14,106
<i>Stupid Ichika! I'm sure he's</i>
<i>completely forgotten that</i>
<i>tomorrow is the 7th of July.</i>

37
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:17,844
For the love of God, why can't
you all just eat your food
in silence?!

38
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,047
[girl] Um, yes Miss Orimura!

39
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:24,384
Orimura, stop causing such a
racket. Calm it down in
here pronto.

40
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,720
Uh, yes, ma'am. Calming it down.

41
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,529
Sorry about that, Cecilia,
I guess you'll have to do
it by yourself.

42
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:43,337
In exchange, why don't you
come by my room later tonight?
Okay?

43
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,607
Come to your room?

44
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,345
Oh Ichika, could you
possibly mean we...

45
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,650
Oh, after we got everything
ready, we really thought we'd
be able to play with Orimura.

46
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,653
[girl] What a disappointment.

47
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:37,724
Mmhmm. And he's been in Miss
Orimura's room forever.

48
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,363
[humming]

49
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:48,368
<i>It's a good thing I was</i>
<i>prepared for this sort of</i>
<i>situation, just in case!</i>

50
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,607
Oh wow! Ceci's wearing some
naughty underwear!

51
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,745
Is she, now?
Let's strip her and see it!

52
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,648
Yeah, peel it off!
Peel it all off!

53
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:01,916
[struggling]

54
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,919
[Cecilia] You get back! Stop it!
Don't touch that!

55
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,857
Oh! That's Freanch black lace
with no underwire!

56
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,760
[girl] Oh, so that's what
naughty underwear looks like?

57
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,196
[Tanimoto] Yeah and she pulls
it off well too.

58
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:18,366
[in unison] Oh la la!
Cecilia is so naughty!

59
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,869
I am not! It's not like that!

60
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:25,173
In fact, this is, uh,
merely a young lady's
personal preference.

61
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,743
That's right!
It's a personal preference!

62
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,018
Oh my, that ordeal
was simply beastly.

63
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:39,455
But I finally get to see Ichika
so it's all worth it!

64
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,061
What is going on here?

65
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,496
Ssh.

66
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,234
[Ichika] Are you nervous
Chifuyu? I know it's been
a long time.

67
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,271
[Chifuyu] Of course,
don't be ridiculous.

68
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,540
Hey, don't do it quite so hard.

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,576
[Ichika] Okay, fine.
What about here?

70
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:02,179
[Chifuyu] Oh, that is...
Oh no, not there!

71
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,649
[Ichika] It will feel good soon.
Looks like this has been
building up.

72
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,185
[Chifuyu] Uh...
[Cecilia] Oh! Oh my goodness!

73
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,954
[Cecilia] What in Heaven's name
is going on in there?!
[Ichika] What about here?

74
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:12,890
[Chifuyu] No, not there. Ow!

75
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,993
[Ichika] Sorry.

76
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:28,940
Okay, iditos. Just what was so
interesting about my getting
a massage?

77
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:32,411
Oh, you were giving your
sister a massage?

78
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,580
Ja, that's not what we
thought at all...

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,249
What did you think
we were doing?

80
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,218
Well naturally, we‐

81
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:40,619
Not a single thing!

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,321
Yes, we weren't thinking
at all.

83
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,989
[nervous laughter]

84
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,558
Uh huh...

85
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,193
He may not look like a massuer,
but he has amazing fingers.

86
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,963
Come to think of it,
maybe you should all
let him do you.

87
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:51,931
[in unison] Huh?!

88
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:53,999
[Ichika] Okay,
I'll do Cecilia first.

89
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,635
Oh! I'm going first?

90
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:58,771
Yes, that's why I asked you
here, so come lie down.

91
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:00,941
[squealing]

92
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,710
[Cecilia] O‐Ow! Ow!

93
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,580
Oh, sorry, I'll be gentle.

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,451
[Ichika] Let's see. It doesn't
hurt when I do this, does it?

95
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:13,320
No, not at all.
It feels quite wonderful.

96
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,159
I mean it feels so good that
I find myself becoming rather
sleepy in fact.

97
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,626
[Cecilia] I even...

98
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:21,662
Ah!

99
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,032
Oh my! How precocious!

100
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:26,400
[crying]

101
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,536
But these are really too
mature for you.

102
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,071
Nice shade of black though.

103
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,707
Please ma'am, I really do wish
you would put that down now!

104
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:37,379
[Chifuyu] What? Didn't expect
your lewd 15 year old desires
to be expressed to your teacher?

105
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,581
[whimpering]

106
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,216
Oh, I'm just joking, dear.

107
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:44,086
Hey, Ichika, why don't you
go and buy us some drinks?

108
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,155
Oh, okay.

109
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:56,132
Okay girls, what's with the
dead fish expressions?

110
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,067
Um, the thing is, we, uh...

111
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:03,306
You see, ma'am, this is the
first time we have ever spoken
to you in this way...

112
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,074
[Chifuyu] Okay.

113
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:08,511
We're finally getting down to
the nitty‐gritty, huh?

114
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,687
So, what do you girls
even see in him?

115
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:18,988
[in unison] Huh?!

116
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:21,425
I mean, my brother has his uses,
to be sure.

117
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:25,896
For example, he's good at
cooking, housekeeping, and
he gives fantastic massages.

118
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,498
So, any girl who gets him
would be lucky.

119
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,267
That said, he comes at a price.

120
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,169
[in unison] He's for sale?!

121
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,571
No, you fools.

122
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,473
[in unison] Oh...

123
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,309
Listen, if you're a real woman,
you've got to be willing
to do...

124
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,911
whatever it takes
to nuke your rivals.

125
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,581
Get with the program,
kiddos, okay?

126
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,257
[Ichika] Houki?

127
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,332
Okay, "Please pull", do you
think that this means...

128
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:02,868
Sometimes it's just better
not to know.

129
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,906
Hey wait, should we just leave
it lying there like that?

130
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,911
What are you doing over
here, Ichika?

131
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,180
Something I might regret...

132
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,885
Whoa!

133
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,689
[Ichika] Uh oh...

134
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,893
[Cecilia] Huh?
[Ichika] I knew it.

135
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,328
[screaming]

136
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,602
[laughing]

137
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,242
You fell for it, Ichikun!
Yay, yay!

138
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:44,412
It sure has been a long time,
hasn't it, Tabane?

139
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,515
[Tabane] Mmhmm!
Long time, no see.

140
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:48,817
A really long time!

141
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,652
So, Ichikun,
where'd little Houki go?

142
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,988
Uh, actually she's...

143
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:59,260
That's okay, I'll find her soon
enough just by using this Houki
tracking device I invented.

144
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,364
Okay, Ikkun, I'll see ya later!

145
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,806
Uh, Ichika, who was that strange
person just now?

146
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:14,844
That's Tabane Shinonono,
Houki's big sister.

147
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:28,524
[Chifuyu] As you can see,
everyone with a personal unit
has been assembled here.

148
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:33,396
Um, just a minute, ma'am. Houki
doesn't have her own unit,
does she?

149
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:34,597
Well uh...

150
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:35,832
[Chifuyu] It's all right,
Shinonono.

151
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,267
I'll explain everything...

152
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,502
The reason that she's here is‐

153
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:42,839
[Tabane] Cowabunga!

154
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:47,844
[Tabane] Chii‐chan!

155
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,917
Hello, hello, hello!
Oh, I missed you, Chii‐chan!

156
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:53,985
Let's hug and confirm our
love for each other!

157
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:55,586
Will you just shut up, Tabane?

158
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,222
[Tabane] Using the unforgiving
Iron Claw as always, aren't you?

159
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,158
Ta‐daa! Hi there!

160
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,361
Yes, hello.

161
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:07,465
[Tabane] It's been a while,
hasn't it? How many years
has it been?

162
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,502
I can't believe how much bigger
you've gotten, little sister.

163
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,237
Especially your boobies!

164
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,240
I will so hit you!

165
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,911
You say that afterwards?
That's so cruel!

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,480
She's a real dominatrix,
isn't she, Ikkun?

167
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,348
Uh, well...

168
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,385
You know, Tabane, you should
at least introduce yourself.

169
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,255
Ugh, that's such a pain!

170
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,626
Okay everybody, hi, I'm Tabane
the genius. Hello, that's all.

171
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,593
That's it!

172
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,362
You're Tabane?

173
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,399
As in Tabane, the brilliant
scientist who invented the
IS units?

174
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,836
The Tabane Shinonono?!

175
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,906
Now everyone!
Look, up to the heavens!

176
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,081
[Tabane] Ta‐daa!

177
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,051
This is Houki's own personal
unit, the Akatsubaki!

178
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:01,321
All of its specs are way above
the current models and it's
handmade by me, Tabane!

179
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:07,528
This little beauty is a
fourth‐generation type IS and
Tabane the Genius created it
especially for Houki!

180
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,096
[Charlotte] Fourth generation?

181
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,232
[Cecilia] Wait! other countries
have only just made...

182
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:13,901
the prototypes of the
third generation models!

183
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,104
[Charlotte] Yet she's already...

184
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:19,040
Don't worry, that's just
because I'm Tabane the Genius!

185
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,412
Okay Houki‐pokey, let's go ahead
and start with your fitting
and personalization.

186
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,483
Well mount up, Shinonono.

187
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,725
[typing]

188
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:39,829
Now, I already have some of your
personal data uploaded
and running.

189
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,667
[Tabane] So, I just have
to update it with your
latest information.

190
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:49,606
Unbelievable! Her speed is
simply amazing!

191
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,341
Okay, the fitting
is all done now!

192
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,844
That was super fast!
I did great, huh?

193
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:57,214
Well, take it out for a test
run; try flying it.

194
00:12:57,314 --> 00:13:00,150
It should move exactly how
you imagine it will.

195
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,186
Okay, I'm ready to give
it a shot.

196
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,031
Okay, that's really fast!

197
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:17,501
So, that's the speed of a
fourth generation model?

198
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:18,970
TrÃ©s incroyable!

199
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,972
[Tabane] So, Houki,
what do you think?

200
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,574
It moves even better than you
thought it would, doesn't it?

201
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,509
[Houki] Yeah, I guess.

202
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:26,778
[Tabane] Try using its swords.

203
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:28,580
The Amazuki is the one
on the right...

204
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,348
and the Karaware on the left.

205
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,151
I'll go ahead and send you
some data on the weapons'
specifications.

206
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,160
All right, Amazuki, go!

207
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:47,833
Holy...

208
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,401
That was very nicely done!

209
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:52,538
And now you can try dealing
with these next.

210
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,940
Good luck, sis!

211
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,185
[collective awe]

212
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,553
[Tabane] Mmhmm! Super duper!

213
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:11,658
[laughing]

214
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:15,228
It's perfect.
This IS can do anything!

215
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,897
[Maya] Oh, no!

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,967
Miss Orimura!

217
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,340
[Maya] Look at this...

218
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,744
It's a Level A
priority mission...

219
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:33,180
and apparently it seems the
countermeasures have already
been activated.

220
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,583
This test is suspended for now!

221
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,821
[Chifuyu] I'm afraid there's
something I'll be needing all
of you for.

222
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,657
Hang on, who is that strangly
dressed woman?

223
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,993
That's Tabane Shinonono.

224
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,298
[Chifuyu] Two hours ago,
the Silvario Gospel,

225
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,668
a third generation IS
nicknamed "the Gospel",

226
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,838
jointly developed by America
and Israel, went rogue.

227
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,442
Reports indicate that the unit
began running wild during
test maneuvers...

228
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,777
that were being carried out
in the seas near Hawaii.

229
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,648
Word has now come that it's
disappeared from the area where
it was originally observed.

230
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:10,453
What's important, is that
according to our information,
it was an unmanned unit.

231
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:11,988
Again?

232
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:14,891
As you can see, satellite
tracking now indicates that
the Gospel...

233
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:19,262
will be passing through
our airspace two kilometers
from our present coordinates.

234
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,198
That will occur fifty
minutes from now.

235
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:24,201
The orders that we have just
received from the Academy's
board of directors...

236
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:27,537
have made us responsible for
handling this situation.

237
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,607
[Chifuyu] As we speak, our
instructors are taking the
training units...

238
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:33,611
and locking down all of the air
and sea perimeters.

239
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:37,748
The rest of the action will be
handled by the students who
have personal units.

240
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:39,484
Say what?!

241
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,587
In other words, we are the
ones who wills top that
out‐of‐control IS.

242
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:43,621
Wait, us?!

243
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,623
Must everything surprise you?

244
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:52,597
Before we begin the official
mission brief, this is the time
for any questions you may have.

245
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:57,468
[Cecilia] Ma'am. I would like to
have the full specs and data on
the target IS.

246
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,472
Yes, that's a
reasonable request.

247
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,841
[Chifuyu] However, if any of
this information is leaked,

248
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,410
you'll be tried in a court
of inquiry...

249
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,812
and placed under house arrest
for a minimum of two years.

250
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,781
[Chifuyu] Got it?
[Cecilia] Understood,
instructor.

251
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:15,487
[Cecilia] This is a special
artillery type designed for
widespread target
annihilation...

252
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:21,027
And like my own IS, it seems
that the Gospel is capable
of all ranges of attack.

253
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:24,697
All ranges of attack
plus maneuverability, too?

254
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,333
That'll be tricky.

255
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:30,237
This specialized weaponry looks
rather suspicious, n'est‐ce pas?

256
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:33,373
I think that continuous defense
will be quite difficult.

257
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:36,977
This data leaves
its hand‐to‐hand
capabilities unknown.

258
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,346
Can't we do so some
preliminary recon?

259
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,415
No, that won't be possible.

260
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:45,586
The problem is that the target
is currently moving across the
ocean at supersonic speeds.

261
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:48,055
So we'll only have one chance
to intercept it.

262
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:50,224
But if they're just going to
have one chance at it,

263
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,792
then that means...

264
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,395
only a unit that has single‐shot
kill capabilities...

265
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,497
will have any chance
of hitting it.

266
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,833
Hmm... Mmhmm...

267
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:00,569
Uh, what?!

268
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,337
We get this thing with your
Reiraku Byakuya.

269
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,375
It's the only thing that could
possibly do it.

270
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,343
But the problem will be...

271
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:11,180
The problem is how to get
Ichika to the cooridnates.

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,018
Success will be difficult unless
he conserves all his energy
to use in the attack,

273
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,987
so how will we get him there?

274
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:22,224
That's difficult. He doesn't
have an IS with enough speed
to catch up to the target.

275
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,860
And he will also need an
ultra‐sensitive Hyper Sensor.

276
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,764
[Ichika] H‐Hey! Now hold on just
a minute! So, I'm the one
who's going?

277
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,233
[in unison] Well of course!

278
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,001
[Ichika] Will you stop speaking
in unison like that?!

279
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:36,272
Look, Orimura, this isn't a
training exercise: this is
real combat.

280
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:40,243
If you don't think you're up to
it yet, no one here is going to
force you to go.

281
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,050
Oh, I'll go.

282
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,420
And I'll show you that
I can do it!

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,821
[Chifuyu] All right,
that's settled.

284
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:53,023
So, at the present time,
the personal IS unit...

285
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:54,391
that's able to go the
fastest is‐

286
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,427
[Tabane] Hold it, hold it!

287
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:59,931
Just put this operation on
hold for a minute, okay?

288
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,833
Hyaa!

289
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,568
Chii‐chan, Chii‐chan!
Guess what?

290
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,671
I have an even better plan
that's in my head and now
it's printing!

291
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,840
[Tabane] So where's your
printer?
[Chifuyu] Will you leave?

292
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,375
Just listen, 'kay?

293
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:14,346
First off, it's definitely the
Akatsubaki's turn to shine!

294
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,148
What?

295
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,564
<i>All right, Akatsubaki,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

296
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:45,679
I'm just curious, but do the
top brass know that Professor
Shinonono is here right now?

297
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:47,113
I'll inform them later.

298
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:51,217
But stopping that runaway IS
is our top priority at the
moment.

299
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:55,189
All right now, Houki!
Unfolding Armor: activate!

300
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:02,997
[Tabane] Unfolding Armor is
now standard to all fourth
generation IS models.

301
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,699
To put it in simple terms:

302
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,369
The Akatsubaki is the next
evolutionary step of the
Yukihira Nigata.

303
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:12,740
The next step?

304
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,279
That's right! And I used
Unfolding Armor for the
unit's entire body! Yahoo!

305
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:22,317
Still, we do have
to deal with that.

306
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:27,288
Hey, I bet things running
amok by the ocean really
remind you of that Shirokishi
Incident, huh?

307
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:31,159
The Shirokishi Incident...

308
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,964
[Ichika] <i>That was Ten years</i>
<i>ago, just one month after</i>
<i>Tabane unveiled the IS,</i>

309
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:40,869
<i>2,341 missiles around the</i>
<i>world were launched at once.</i>

310
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,907
<i>All of those missles' on‐board</i>
<i>guidance systems were hacked</i>
<i>simultaneously,</i>

311
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,076
<i>and they all headed</i>
<i>straight toward Japan.</i>

312
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:51,514
<i>And a single girl piloting</i>
<i>a silvery IS appeared out</i>
<i>of nowhere.</i>

313
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:55,885
<i>That IS, which would come to</i>
<i>be known as the Shirokishi,</i>

314
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:59,822
<i>single‐handedly shot down</i>
<i>all the missiles.</i>

315
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:03,060
<i>And as the sun set,</i>
<i>it simply disappeared.</i>

316
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,495
<i>As if it had only been</i>
<i>an illusion...</i>

317
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:15,973
And who was inside that
Shirokishi, huh Chii‐chan?

318
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:17,508
[Chifuyu] I have no idea.

319
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,744
Well! I'll bet it was someone
who has a 35 inch bust line.

320
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:28,386
That's so cruel, Chii‐chan!
You've split poor Miss Tabane's
brain right in two!

321
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:29,754
Well isn't that nice?

322
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,923
Now your left half will be able
to take turns...

323
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,625
thinking with the right half.

324
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,160
Good one! Yay!

325
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,597
You're so smart, Chii‐chan!

326
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:41,933
Let's get back on topic...

327
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:46,805
Okay super genius, how long
until adjustments to the
Akatsubaki are finished?

328
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:49,041
[Cecilia] Miss Orimura!
[Chifuyu] Yeah, what?

329
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:52,511
[Cecilia] Ma'am, I'm sure that
I could achieve the objective
in my Blue Tears!

330
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:58,083
As you know, the Gunner
Strike, my high‐maneuverability
package, is on its way here now.

331
00:20:58,183 --> 00:21:01,153
And does that package operate
on molecular exchange?

332
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,223
[Cecilia] Well, um, no,
not yet...

333
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:07,627
By the by, I could finish
adjusting the Akatsubaki in
seven minutes, no problem.

334
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:12,733
Fine, that's it. The mission
brief is Orimura and Shinonono
will engage the Gospel.

335
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,937
She drives, he shoots. Let's
blow that thing away, people.

336
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,373
We launch in thirty minutes,
ready or not.

337
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:23,544
So don't just stand there,
get your asses moving!

338
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:37,759
[Tabane] Well, this has a nice
feeling to it!

339
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:40,061
[Houki] No! You've got
it all wrong.

340
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,897
Aw, now don't make such
a frowny face, baby sister.

341
00:21:42,997 --> 00:21:44,632
[Tabane] Your face'll freeze
like that! Ew!

342
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,817
This is the face I was
born with.

343
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,244
Oh, yes, that's right.

344
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:52,029
Anyway, let's hurry up and
finish adjustments to
the Akatsubaki!

345
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:59,254
<i>I've got to make this work!</i>

346
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:04,054
<i>I'm the only one who can do it.</i>
<i>Who can execute a one‐shot</i>
<i>kill.</i>

347
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,754
My own personal IS. At last,
you're finally mine.

348
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:53,210
[girl 1] Things have gotten
pretty intense, haven't they?

349
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,577
[girl 2] I never
would've believed that some
out‐of‐control IS might show up!

350
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:59,710
[girl 3] I wonder if Orimura
and the others are going to
be all right?

351
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,043
[girl 1] Ah, jeez! If only we
had our own personal units too!

352
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,210
[girl 2] Yeah, then we might be
able to go give them some
support right now!

353
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,843
[girl 3] Well, I guess there's
no other choice. All we can
do for now is pray.

354
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:13,843
[girl 2] The next episode:
"Get Ready"

355
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:17,743
[girl 1] Please, Orimura,
you and the others make
it back safely, okay?
