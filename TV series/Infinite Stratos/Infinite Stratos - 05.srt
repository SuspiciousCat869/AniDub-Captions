1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:04,293
[Chifuyu] This is his only
chance because it just
works once.

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:06,462
[Rinin] Whatever happens,
it's not my fault!

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:11,433
[Ichika] I have to get it
together! I'm using the exact
same machine that Chifuyu uses.

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,201
[Maya] So, it really
was unmanned.

5
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:15,737
And it seems the core
was unregistered.

6
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:56,328
[Dan] So, everyone except
you is a girl, huh?

7
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:57,895
Must be nice to be you.

8
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,530
[Ichika] Oh, no it's not.

9
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,532
Aw man, you're such a liar!

10
00:02:01,632 --> 00:02:05,001
Your emails alone tell me that
you're living in paradise!

11
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:06,303
Got any comp tickets?

12
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,104
No, you idiot.

13
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:12,475
Although, it has been nice
since Rin transferred to
my school.

14
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:15,311
[Ichika] Until that, I didn't
have many people to talk to.

15
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,179
Oh yeah, I get it.

16
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,181
Rinin, huh?

17
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,184
[Ran] Hey bro, your lunch is
ready now.

18
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,219
Hurry up and eat‐ huh?

19
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,887
Ichika, is that you?!

20
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,990
Hey, Ran, long time no see, huh?

21
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:35,863
Gulp! I, uh... I'm sorry!

22
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,431
I didn't know you were here.

23
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,500
Yeah, I had a quick break.

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,570
So I thought I'd check on the
house, and drop by here.

25
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,272
Oh, I see.

26
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,039
[Dan] Hey sis,
can't you knock?

27
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,977
Now he thinks you're rude.
I mean, he is our guest
after all.

28
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,646
Why didn't you tell me about
it then?

29
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,584
Oh, I guess I didn't tell you.

30
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,452
You're right,
sorry about that, sis.

31
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:10,560
[Ran] Umm, Ichika...

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,030
Stay here as long as
you want, okay?

33
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:15,332
You've changed your clothes.

34
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,066
Are you about to go
out somewhere?

35
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,401
Oh, this?

36
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,737
Well this is really just, umm...

37
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:24,607
[Ichika] Ah! A date?!
[Ran] I'm not dating anyone!

38
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:29,678
I bet you act exactly like that
at school too, right?

39
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,379
[Ichika] What are you
talking about?

40
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,148
[Dan] Just forget about it.

41
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,417
I feel sorry for Rinin.

42
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,986
Surprise! It's moving day!

43
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,154
What?

44
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,056
We've made new arrangements
for you.

45
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,025
Miss Shinonono, you'll be
moving to a different room.

46
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,827
Now wait just a darn minute!

47
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:50,263
Are you saying that I have to
pack and move out right away?

48
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,165
Oh, yes, I think that would
be for the best.

49
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,201
After all, I'm sure the
situation where a young
man and a young woman...

50
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,038
have to share the same room
isn't really comfortable for
either of you.

51
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,873
Well, to be honest...

52
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,808
Hey, you don't have to
worry about me.

53
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:08,046
I'm sure I can get up on time
and brush my teeth even
without your help!

54
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,815
Miss Yamada, I want to change
rooms right now!

55
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,317
O‐Okay.

56
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:14,885
[door opening]

57
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,087
[slam]

58
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:20,357
Now what was she so upset
about now?

59
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:23,226
[Ichika] Well, guess I'll go
to bed.

60
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,027
No point in thinking about it.

61
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,829
[knocking]

62
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,130
Yeah?

63
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,671
Oh, did you forgot something?

64
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,140
I‐I come to broker terms.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,742
Why are you being formal?

66
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:45,546
[Houki] In regards to the
the individual tournament
next month:

67
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:51,085
If I win the tournament...

68
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:53,153
If I do...

69
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,389
You have to date me!

70
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,059
[Ichika] What?

71
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:00,960
[Tanimoto] Did you hear?

72
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,061
[in unison] We did!

73
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:03,096
This news is...

74
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:04,963
really big!

75
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:07,099
[girl 1] Hey, have you all heard
the latest rumor?

76
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,267
[girl 2] What, you mean about
the IS from the other day?

77
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,738
[girl 3] Supposedly, a machine
that was still in testing went
on a rampage.

78
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,006
[girl 4] No, that's not it!

79
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,841
Whoever wins the tournament
this month...

80
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,943
...gets to go on a date
with Orimura!

81
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:22,913
So, do you know what it is that
all these girls are so
excited about?

82
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,550
I have absolutely no
idea whatsoever.

83
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,119
The story's distorted and
spreading like crazy.

84
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:32,188
You must have said something
to someone! That has to be it!

85
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:36,091
Aw, no way. I don't really think
that could have been what
happened at all.

86
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,260
[Ichika] Good morning.

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,129
What's with all the excitement?

88
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,164
Oh, no reason!

89
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:45,467
Get in your seat now!

90
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,602
Homeroom is starting
immediately.

91
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:50,872
Guess what, class?

92
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:53,307
We're about to meet yet another
new transfer student.

93
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,976
[murmuring]

94
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:06,553
I'm Charles Dunois and I
have came from France.

95
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:09,288
It is nice to meet you.

96
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:11,257
[girl 1] Dude, you're a boy?

97
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:15,694
Oui. I heard about a male
student who's in the same
situation as I am,

98
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,162
so I transferred here.

99
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,297
[squealing]

100
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:20,665
There's a second male student!

101
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,067
And he's in our class!

102
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,269
He's cute, and he's the type
girls want to protect!

103
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:27,237
Silence, damnit!
That's quite enough!

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,277
Today, we're conducting joint
practical training with Class 2.

105
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:37,046
I want everyone changed and
assembled on the second
ground ASAP.

106
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,248
[Chifuyu] And Orimura...
[Ichika] Y‐Yes?

107
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:42,751
[Chifuyu] Since you're both
males, I want you to keep an
eye on Dunois.

108
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:43,919
Let's get moving, girls.

109
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,421
So, you're Orimura.

110
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,089
Nice to meet you, I am‐

111
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:48,757
Oh, no time for that.

112
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:50,225
Getting there is our
top priority.

113
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,494
[Ichika] The girls'll start
changing soon, so uh...

114
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:53,995
Let's get our motor on!

115
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,065
[in unison] Aaaw...

116
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:02,303
[Ichika] We're going to change
in the locker room at the arena.

117
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,738
We have to change there every
time we have practical training,

118
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,873
so you'd better get used
to beating the girls.

119
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,574
Oh... right.

120
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,276
Hey, why do you look
so anxious?

121
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,611
Do you need to go use
the restroom?

122
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,179
No! That's not it!

123
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,516
Hey, I see the transfer student!

124
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,350
And he's standing with Orimura!

125
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,618
Huh? Mon dieu!

126
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,253
There he is! Over here!

127
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,322
Move it! Move it! Out of my way!

128
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,890
[girl 1] Look!
They're holding hands!

129
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,861
[girl 2] I do like Orimura's
dark hair, but I like the
blonde too.

130
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,862
Run for it!

131
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,031
[girl 3] They're leaving!
Hey, wait!

132
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,232
Let's follow them!

133
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:36,534
Hey, wait!

134
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,535
At least let me take a picture
for the paper!

135
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,303
[girls] Aaaw...

136
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,372
What are they making
a racket for?

137
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,674
Well, I'm pretty sure that it
has something to do with
the fact...

138
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:48,444
that you and I are the only
males who have been able to
operate an IS so far.

139
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:50,679
Oh, yes...

140
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,081
That's right, we are.

141
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,716
Just keep running, okay?

142
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:56,652
[panting]

143
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:59,020
[Ichika] I think we managed to
lose them somehow.

144
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,523
[Charles] I'm sorry. I've
already gotten you into trouble.

145
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:04,091
[Ichika] No problem.

146
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,325
I mean, you're my savior.

147
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:08,162
It's tough to be the only guy
in the entire school.

148
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:09,830
No, really?

149
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,665
Yeah, so I owe you one.

150
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:13,567
My name's Ichika Orimura.

151
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,469
But just call me Ichika.

152
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,303
It's nice to meet you, Ichika.

153
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,939
You may call me Charles
if you like.

154
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,907
[Ichika] Oh man,
look at the time!

155
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,176
We've got a long run so
hurry up and get changed.

156
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,711
AH!

157
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,415
[Ichika] Come on, you'll be late
if you don't get changed fast.

158
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:34,018
And our teacher happens to be
very insistant on punctuality.

159
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:37,021
[Charles] Mmhmm... I‐I‐I'm going
to change now.

160
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:40,624
But would you mind looking the
other way, s'il‐vous‐plaÃ®t?

161
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:44,661
I wasn't going to stare at you
while you're changing,
but whatever.

162
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,964
Just hurry it up, okay?

163
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:49,665
[Ichika] Guh!

164
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,767
Is something wrong?

165
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:54,036
It's just that you changed
incredibly fast.

166
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,138
Do you have some secret trick
to that or something?

167
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:59,508
Oh, not really. I don't.

168
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,711
[Ichika] That's a shame, 'cause
these things are a pain to
put it on.

169
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:07,248
Since you can't wear any
underwear beneath them,
my things are always
getting caught.

170
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:08,850
Your "things" get caught?

171
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,019
[Ichika] And how...
[Charles] Uh...

172
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,822
[Ichika] Your suit looks really
easy to put on.

173
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:18,258
Mmhmm. It's an original kind
made by Dunois.

174
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,659
Dunois?

175
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,961
Your last name is
Dunois too, right?

176
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,331
My papa is the company CEO.

177
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:29,301
As you know, Dunois is
the largest IS‐related
corporation in all of France.

178
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,738
Ah, so you're the CEO's son?

179
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,640
Now it makes sense.

180
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,074
Just what does that mean?

181
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,709
Well, I don't know what it is,
but you've got class.

182
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,579
You look like you've come from
a prestigious family.

183
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,681
So, now I get it.

184
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,591
[Chifuy] Your practical training
begins now.
[class] Right!

185
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:57,126
First, we'll need to demonstrate
a real battle.

186
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,527
Fan! Alcott!

187
00:09:58,627 --> 00:09:59,828
[Rinin] Ma'am!
[Cecilia] Ma'am!

188
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,030
Since you have your
own machines,

189
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,266
I'm sure you'll
gladly volunteer.

190
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,567
Step forward, girls.

191
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,134
What a nuisance...

192
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,837
Why is it always me?

193
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:12,374
Oh my, such a vulgar spectacle.
Do I really have to do this?

194
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:16,110
Show a little more enthusiasm.

195
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,181
This is the perfect chance to
to show off for the boys.

196
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,416
It looks like it's time for
Cecilia Alcott,

197
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:25,451
England's representative
contender, to step up and
take charge!

198
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:29,255
Yeah and I can show the
difference between those
who have personal machines...

199
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,756
and those who don't!

200
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:34,326
What did the teacher just
say to those girls?

201
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,428
How on earth would I know that?

202
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:37,997
So, who's my rival?

203
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:41,133
I wouldn't mind tossing you
away, restaurant girl.

204
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,302
That's my line.

205
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:44,436
You're dead meat.

206
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:46,070
Oh, don't get ahead
of yourselves.

207
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,206
You haven't met your opponent.

208
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,343
[screaming]

209
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,946
[Maya] Get out of the way,
please and thank you!

210
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,991
Uh, excuse me...

211
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,826
Orimura...

212
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:21,369
Yes, there does appear to be a
little bit of a problem here...

213
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:25,205
You see, if this progresses,
Miss Orimura's going to be
my sister‐in‐law,

214
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:29,076
and while I have to admit that
does sound quite tempting I‐

215
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,544
[pew]
Sorry!

216
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,779
[laughing]

217
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,249
Oh my goodness! Sorry, I seem to
have missfired.

218
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,918
[clang]

219
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:41,987
[Rinin] Ichika!

220
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:51,263
Hey, Orimura, you didn't get
hurt there, did you?

221
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:54,832
I'm fine, thank you so much
for asking though.

222
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:58,335
[Chifuyu] By the way,
Miss Yamada used to be a
representative contender.

223
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,804
Making a shot like that is
nothing for her.

224
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:02,539
Thanks, but that was as
long time ago.

225
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,208
And I could never break free
from being just a contender.

226
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,511
[Chifuyu] But you're still
more than a match for these
two together.

227
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,681
What? You can't mean it's going
to be two against one.

228
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,484
I don't think that's a very
good idea.

229
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:15,951
Oh, don't worry.

230
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:19,121
I'm sure your embarrassment
won't last very long.

231
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,791
Let the carnage begin!

232
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,634
[Cecilia] Just so you know, I'm
not going to hold back!

233
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:37,204
[Rinin] We weren't actually
being very serious
earlier anyway!

234
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,871
Well here I come!

235
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:57,555
Mr. Dunois, I'd like you to tell
us about the IS that Miss Yamada
is using.

236
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:58,990
But of course!

237
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,059
Miss Yamada's IS is a
"Rafale Revive"...

238
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,861
made by the Dunois Corporation.

239
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:07,631
[Charles] It was created at the
end of the second‐generation
development.

240
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:12,402
However, its specs are
not inferior to the early
third‐generation models.

241
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:16,806
This is the latest mass‐produced
model IS that is currently
being used.

242
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:20,309
Right now, its share ranks
third worldwide.

243
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,480
Furthermore, this model can be
modified for combat, artillery,
and defense.

244
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,387
[screaming]

245
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,095
[Cecilia] I can't believe this
is happening to me.

246
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:44,397
[Rinin] Couldn't you tell that
she knew just exactly...

247
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,599
which way you would go to try to
escape from her?!

248
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:52,505
And what about you?! You were
taking unnecessary shots like
an idiot!

249
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,809
[Chifuyu] I hope you now all
understand what your instructor
is capable of.

250
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,711
And knowing that, show her
the proper respect.

251
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:02,714
For the first phase of
practical training,
you'll form teams.

252
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,817
Those who have personal machines
will be the group leaders.

253
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,585
So get forming already!

254
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,587
Let me join your group, Orimura!

255
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,121
Will you answer
all my questions?

256
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,557
[girl] I want to see your
control techniques, Dunois!

257
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:16,359
Oh, hey, can I join you too?

258
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:25,001
Don't touch anything unless
I tell you to.

259
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,769
And I'm not responsible if you
hurt yourself.

260
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,507
Now, I want you ladies to take
turns and try putting it on and‐

261
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:34,610
[Rinin] I really wish I could've
gone over there too.

262
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,946
[Cecilia] It's times like this,
I curse myself for being such
an elite.

263
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,617
[Ichika] Okay, in order of your
attendance number,

264
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,720
I want you to put on the IS,
activate it and walk.

265
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,954
The first one up is...

266
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,689
Me, me, me! My attendance number
is one!

267
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,090
I'm Kiyoka Aikawa!

268
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,192
I'm in the handball club and
my hobbies include...

269
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,028
watching sports and jogging!

270
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,196
Nice to meet you!

271
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,132
Hey, no fair!

272
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,333
[girl 2] Yeah, me too!
[girl 3] Me three!

273
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,068
I knew it was you at
first sight!

274
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,270
[girls] Ooh, pick me! Pick me!

275
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,538
Umm...

276
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,679
Welcome to the man‐meat
grinder, Charles.

277
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,784
[Ichika] That's it, Aikawa.
Just like that. Very good.

278
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,519
Okay, can you stop now?

279
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,821
Uh... u‐uh...

280
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:28,491
Okay, now switch with the
next person.

281
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,926
I was so nervous.

282
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,095
Ah! Oh...

283
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:34,664
So, who's next?

284
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:37,499
[Houki] It's me.

285
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:42,904
However, there's no way I can
reach the cockpit with it
left like that.

286
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:47,075
Actually, that's a common
mistake a lot of riders make
in the beginning.

287
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,743
[Maya] Orimura, can you make
sure she's properly mounted?

288
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:51,945
[Ichika] What?!
[Houki] Excuse me?!

289
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,948
Orimura, take Byakushiki
out now.

290
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,084
[Ichika] Right...

291
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:04,290
Uh, and just what is he supposed
to be doing with that?

292
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,492
He's going to pick you up
in his arms, of course.

293
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,494
And then shove you on
that big thing.

294
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:09,295
[squealing]

295
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:11,597
He's going to pick me up?

296
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:12,864
And shove me on it?

297
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:15,000
I guess I have no choice, huh?

298
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,470
Try not to fall, okay?

299
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:28,045
<i>So, this must be what it's like</i>
<i>to be carried like a princess!</i>

300
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,549
You know how to operate
it, right?

301
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,551
Just activate it and walk, then
switch with the next person.

302
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:36,986
Ichika!

303
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,155
Hm? Yes, Houki?

304
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,390
[Houki] I was just wondering...

305
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,027
Whether you had made any plans
yet for lunch today?

306
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,394
No, not really. Why?

307
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,030
That's excellent! Me neither!

308
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,864
Hey, why don't you and I have
our lunch together...

309
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:51,232
outside for a change?

310
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,067
Hmm? Wouldn't that be nice?

311
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,436
Sure, I guess so.

312
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,639
Yes!

313
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,344
What's going on here?

314
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:07,380
Well, the more the merrier,
don't they say?

315
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,283
Plus, Charles only just
transferred to this school,

316
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:12,752
so he doesn't really know his
way around without me.

317
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:15,054
[Houki] Maybe so, but...

318
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:25,663
Um, Ichika, do you think it was
really okay for me to join
you here?

319
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:26,897
Of course it was.

320
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:28,266
We boys should stick together,

321
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,934
especially since we'll be
roommates from now on.

322
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,369
Oh, I'm so touched.

323
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,705
You know, you're really
a sweet guy.

324
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,308
Would you like to tell me
why you're blushing?

325
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:41,411
Blushing?! I'm not blushing,
am I?!

326
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,081
Wow, sweet & sour pork!

327
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,083
Yup, made it this morning.

328
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,050
You said you wanted to have
some, right?

329
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,622
Ahem. Ichika, it so happens that
I also awakened bright and early
this morning...

330
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:57,392
and so I prepared this
delightful basket of
sandwiches for you.

331
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:02,530
[Cecilia] I just, um, wanted
to let you know that we do have
tasty food in England as well.

332
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,199
Yeah, well, it sure does
look good.

333
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,833
Let me try this one...

334
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,573
Good, yes?
I do hope you like it!

335
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:16,575
There's plenty more,
so eat all you want!

336
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:20,178
Oh, well then, I'll have some
more later, okay?

337
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:22,815
Let's see, I have to
try Houki's next.

338
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,250
Well, this is what I brought.

339
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,021
[Ichika] Woah,
that looks so good!

340
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,723
You spent so much time
with this!

341
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:35,792
I was already making some for
myself, so I made some for
you too,

342
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,829
but I only spent time on it
because it was for me.

343
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,631
I know, but it's still amazing.

344
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:42,799
Thanks so much, Houki.

345
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,403
Hold on, stomach!
Here comes the good stuff!

346
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,242
Wow, so good!

347
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,544
I bet you really put a lot of
effort into making this.

348
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh, just some ginger, soy sauce
and grated garlic to season it.

349
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:02,617
[Houki] Oh, and I added a
little pepper to it at the
beginning as well.

350
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:05,653
The secret ingredient is a
little bit of grated daikon.

351
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,189
[Ichika] Oh, this is
seriously good.

352
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,890
Aren't you going to eat
any, Houki?

353
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,261
[Houki] No, I already ate
the ones that didn't come
out as well.

354
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,264
Oh, what I meant by that is
I'm fine. Honestly.

355
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,131
But I'm glad you like it.

356
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:21,501
Please, enjoy the rest.

357
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,135
Aw, you should have some, too.

358
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,737
Come here! Open wide!

359
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:29,007
Uh, what are you doing?

360
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,910
Come on, just one bite.

361
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,180
O‐Okay, then... Just one bite.

362
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,452
It is good.

363
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:44,488
I know! This fried chicken's
really delicious.

364
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,290
Oh, it's not fried chicken,

365
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,292
but it is good.

366
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,095
Oh! I believe I know what is
going on here!

367
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:57,133
You must be doing the famous
"say 'ah'" thing that Japanese
couples do, am I right?

368
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,268
You guys must get along well.

369
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,336
But why are they getting along
so well?!

370
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:04,639
I find this completely
outrageous! I demaned a do‐over!

371
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:08,776
I have an idea, why don't we
all exchange one piece with
each other?

372
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,313
There's no problem if we
all feed each other, no?

373
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,582
[Ichika] No, I don't mind.

374
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,285
Well, I guess it's all right
as long as Ichika doesn't mind.

375
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:23,323
Normally, I wouldn't
do anything that so goes
against the fundamentals
of proper table manners,

376
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,092
but I suppose I should follow
the old expression,

377
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,127
"When in Rome,
do as the Romans do".

378
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,462
All right, eat my pork.

379
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,764
Try my sweet & sour
pork now, Ichika!

380
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,367
Here Ichika, you'll love
my sandwich spread!

381
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,809
Two guys sharing a room is more
like it, huh?

382
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:48,712
This is very different
from European tea.

383
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:52,683
It's not what I'm used to,
but it is still quite excellent.

384
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:59,356
So I understand that you've been
doing your IS training after
school everyday.

385
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,923
Would that be correct?

386
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:04,493
Yeah, but that's only because
I'm way behind everybody else.

387
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,895
So would you mind if I started
training with you?

388
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:10,098
I think I can be of help to
you since I have my own machine.

389
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:12,333
Sure, that would be great.

390
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,802
Okay then! It's a deal.

391
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:18,138
[murming]

392
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:22,710
Okay class, I have yet another
exciting announcement to
make today.

393
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm about to introduce
another new addition to
our expanding classroom.

394
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,216
Meet our newest transfer student
from Germany, Laura Bodewig.

395
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:31,184
[class] Huh?

396
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:32,585
[girl 1] What's going on?

397
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,587
[girl 2] Two transfer students
in only two days?

398
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,123
[girl 3] No matter how you look
at it, it's very strange.

399
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,024
Please be quiet now, everyone!

400
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:42,227
Her introduction isn't over yet,
so show some respect.

401
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:45,097
Yes, go ahead, Laura.
Please finish.

402
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:46,698
Jawohl, mentor.

403
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:48,065
<i>Mentor?</i>

404
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,803
<i>So, that means when Chifuyu</i>
<i>was in Germany she was...</i>

405
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,838
I am Laura Bodewig.

406
00:21:56,407 --> 00:22:00,076
[Maya] So, um, is that all you
wanted to say, Laura?

407
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,012
Yes, that's all.

408
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:03,697
[Laura] And you must be...

409
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:08,430
[slap]

410
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,730
[gasp]

411
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:13,395
[Laura] I do not approve.

412
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:18,595
In fact, I will never approve
that you're her brother!

413
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:52,839
[girl 1] We've got another
transfer student!

414
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,306
[girl 2] And she's the
representative contender
from Germany!

415
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,139
[girl 3] It seems that she
has an unusual connection
with Orimura.

416
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,839
[girl 1] But why is she acting
so hostile towards him?

417
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,139
[girl 2] And what is her
relationship with Lady Chifuyu?

418
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,872
[girl 3] What really happened to
them in the past?

419
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:07,106
The story unfolds with
so many mysteries!

420
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,039
[girl 1] Check it out! And it
looks like some kind of drama...

421
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:12,006
is going on with Charles
as well.

422
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:13,472
[girl 2] It's the next episode,

423
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,339
"My Roommate is a Blonde,
Young Nobleman"

424
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:19,106
[girl 3] And the secret of
the beautiful boy will finally
be revealed!
