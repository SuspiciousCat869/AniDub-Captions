1
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,988
[Laura] To think I am going
to face you in the very
first match.

2
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,058
How very convenient.

3
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,194
Now I don't even have to wait.

4
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:21,231
Yeah, that's how I feel.

5
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,102
Like Christmas with
more violence.

6
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:33,148
[beep, beep, beep]

7
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:34,516
[in unison] I will crush you!

8
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:35,785
[buzzer]

9
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:46,467
Just as I expected...

10
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,569
A.I.C...

11
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,373
And I thought he understood
it now.

12
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:55,080
A preemptive attack right after
the match begins?

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,349
You're so predictable.

14
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,753
Thanks so much.

15
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,292
I'm so glad to know that you're
able to read my mind.

16
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:52,082
[Charles] You won't get away!

17
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,453
Now, here comes the
rapid switch!

18
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,472
You'd better not forget
about me, gentlemen.

19
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,827
What are you doing?!

20
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:27,667
[screaming]

21
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:33,475
Poor Houki. Do you think Laura
thought that was helping her?

22
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,445
No, she was just in her way.

23
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:37,615
That stupid German cow.

24
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:51,435
I'm sorry that your
opponent's not Ichika.

25
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:54,340
What? Stop that!

26
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,080
[Maya] Hmm, so do you think
that their plan is to go after
Miss Shinonono first?

27
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,448
[Chifuyu] Smart strategy.

28
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,484
Bodewig doesn't understand
the advantage of...

29
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:05,789
having anyone else on her side
in a combat situation.

30
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,261
She's been unable to think of
her partner as an asset from
the start.

31
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,130
But in contrast to
Bodewig's approach,

32
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,937
the coordination that Orimura
and Dunois has been simply
brilliant so far.

33
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:19,041
Yes, but I would expect
nothing less from them.

34
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,021
[hiss]

35
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:30,792

[alarm]

37
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,467
[Houki] Is that it?

38
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,012
Thanks for waiting.

39
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:46,415
And thanks for the assist!
Merci, Charles!

40
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,450
So, where's Houki?

41
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,319
Oh, she's taking a break.

42
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,455
[Ichika] Now that
was impressive.

43
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:54,059
But I have a little something
else up my sleeve!

44
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:15,758
One more time.

45
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,866
Resistance is futile!

46
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,641
[Ichika] Sorry, Laura.
You're forgetting something.

47
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:30,612
There are two people
on our team, remember?

48
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,087
See that?

49
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,790
So predictable!

50
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,592
[Maya] Another combination?

51
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:43,063
[Chifuyu] He's finally realized
the fundamental weakness
of the A. I. C.

52
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:47,369
[Maya] Huh?
[Chifuyu] Its overall
effectiveness can only
be sustained...

53
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,541
while your focus remains
on your target.

54
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,787
[system shutting down]

55

[alarm]

56
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,325
Aw, you can't keep fighting...

57
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,364
now that your shield energy has
been exhausted, can you?

58
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,567
[Laura] Now you're just
in my way!

59
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,639
Charles, no!

60
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:16,278
Die!

61
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,653
[Charles] It's not over yet!

62
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,927
It has an ignition boost?!

63
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,463
[Laura] That wasn't in the data!

64
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,598
[Charles] That's right!

65
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,801
Because I've never used
it before.

66
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,971
You mean you just now learned
how to do that?!

67
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,274
But it's powerless against
my canceling barrier‐

68
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:37,709
[boom]

69
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,753
That's Charles' assault rifle!

70
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:48,024
Why won't you just die already?!

71
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:52,965
[Charles] You're aiming
the wrong way.

72
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,769
Or can't you hit me from here?

73
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:58,039
Nein! Not the shield pierce!

74
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,813
[screaming]

75
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:09,155
That's it!

[cheering]

<i>No! I can't lose...</i>

78
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,543
<i>There's no way I can lose!</i>

79
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,111
<i>I can't!</i>

80
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:35,727
[scientist] DNA reinforced

81
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,030
Your new code name will be...

82
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,100
Laura Bodewig.

83
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,576
[Laura] <i>I was created, born,</i>
<i>raised and trained...</i>

84
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,479
<i>for one purpose only.</i>

85
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,949
<i>I was made to fight.</i>

86
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,851
<i>But not just a fighter,</i>

87
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,988
<i>I was an elite.</i>

88
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,325
<i>And I was always on top.</i>

89
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,262
<i>However, that all changed...</i>

90
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:03,701
<i>when the world's most powerful</i>
<i>weapon emerged.</i>

91
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,303
<i>The IS.</i>

92
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:09,242
<i>After that, in order to</i>
<i>enhance my compatibility,</i>

93
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:12,046
<i>a surgical procedure was</i>
<i>performed immediately...</i>

94
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:15,919
<i>and my eye was implanted</i>
<i>with a nanomachine.</i>

95
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,224
<i>I was willing to have</i>
<i>the modification.</i>

96
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:23,663
<i>However, my body was unable to</i>
<i>accommodate the augmentation,</i>

97
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:27,135
<i>and as a result,</i>
<i>I was labeled a failure.</i>

98
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,274
<i>Until one day, I met her.</i>

99
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:33,811
<i>And everything changed.</i>

100
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:37,416
<i>She was an extremely</i>
<i>skilled instructor.</i>

101
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:44,827
<i>And once again, in the IS</i>
<i>dedicated unit, I was to</i>
<i>become to best.</i>

102
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,902
[Laura] I want to become as
strong as you are.

103
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,273
What is it that makes
you so strong?

104
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,812
I do it for my younger brother.

105
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:01,585
<i>No...</i>

106
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:04,489
<i>But why is it you look so soft?</i>

107
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,229
<i>You have great strength,</i>
<i>dignity and confidence.</i>

108
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,767
<i>Those things are what</i>
<i>I admire in you.</i>

109
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,371
<i>That is why I cannot</i>
<i>forgive him.</i>

110
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,912
<i>That is why I cannot approve of</i>
<i>a male who can make my</i>
<i>instructor that way.</i>

111
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,550
<i>I want power.</i>

Do you want to obtain
greater power?

The situation has been

[Ichika] Yukihira...

129
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,540
Just like my sister,
Chifuyu's...

130
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,845
That thing out there seems to be
completely different...

131
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,381
from the one that attacked here
last month.

132
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:57,453
What do you think happened
to Miss Bodewig?

<i>I ever learned from Chifuyu.</i>

136

<i>Damn you...</i>

<i>How dare you?!</i>

139
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,215
I'll make you pay!

140
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:41,950
What are you doing, you idiot?!

141
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,119
Trying to get killed?

142
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,587
[Ichika] Let me go, damnit!

143
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:45,756
She's really pissing me off!

144
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,258
I'll destroy her!

145
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:48,927
[Maya] What's going on?

146
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,430
Why isn't she moving?

147
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,566
[Chifuyu] Perhaps it's some kind
of automatic program...

148
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,303
that only responds to
weapons and attacks?

149
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,039
[Maya] An automatic program?

150
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,676
But that would mean that Miss
Bodewig's will is...

151
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,879
[Ichika] Stay out of my way!

152
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:03,515
[Houki] Stop it!

153
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,154
What in the hell is
wrong with you?

154
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,459
[Ichika] What's wrong is that
she's using the same...

155
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,795
sword engaging technique
as Chifuyu!

156
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:17,535
That's my sister's!
That technique is
Chifuyu's alone!

157
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,439
[Chifuyu] Listen, Ichika.

158
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,442
You're supposed to swing
a sword.

159
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,114
As long as you let it swing you,
that's not swordsmanship.

160
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:30,721
It's heavy, right?

161
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:34,126
That's the weight of a weapon
that can end someone's life.

162
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,605
[Houki] But what can you even
do right now?

163
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:46,211
Can you even fight when
Byakushiki has no energy left?

164
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,113
No, you can't!

165
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:53,421
[Houki] Take a look, the
situation is being handled
without you doing anything.

166
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,657
[Ichika] You're wrong
about that.

167
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,393
You're dead wrong.

168
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,996
I don't want to fight
but I have to.

169
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,600
Because... because this
is about me too!

170
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,504
And just what is it you're
going to do?

171
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:08,242
[Charles] Actually, sometimes
the solution to no power,

172
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:10,379
is simply to borrow some.

173
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,350
[Charles] Now releasing Revive's
core bypass.

174
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,454
Energy transfer
process, authorized!

175
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:22,196
First, promise me that you
will not lose this fight!

176
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,399
You've got a deal!

177
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,402
I'm no man if I lose, right?

178
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:27,303
Sure!

179
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,838
However, if you lose...

180
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:32,210
you will have to come to school
wearing a girl's uniform.

181
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,615
Uh, sure thing.

182
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:38,753
[Maya] What are they doing?

183
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,021
They're not...

184
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,857
The instructors are ready.

185
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,359
They'll handle it.

186
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,767
The transfer is now complete.

187
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,336
Thanks, I owe you one.

188
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:54,643
Reactivating Byakushiki in
single‐pole mode.

189
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:07,594
Oh, I guess it was only
effective on the weapon
and the right arm.

190
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:08,863
Good enough.

191
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,608
[Houki] Ichika!

192
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,911
Don't die!

193
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,380
Don't you dare die!

194
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,915
Have some faith!

195
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,487
Don't stop believing, Houki.

196
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,858
[Ichika] Hold on to that
and have faith.

197
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,363
You do that and I'll win.

198
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,168
[Ichika] Reiraku Byakuya...

199
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:36,637
Activate!

200
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:40,442
Let's do this,
you cheap immitation!

201
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:34,387
[Laura] <i>Why do you try to</i>
<i>stay strong?</i>

202
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,323
<i>Why are you strong?</i>

203
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,326
[Ichika] But I'm not strong.

204
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:40,830
I'm really not strong at all!

205
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,333
The reason you think I
have strength,

206
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:48,207
is because my need to be
strong makes me strong.

207
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:49,743
That's what makes me that way.

208
00:15:49,843 --> 00:15:53,147
The fact that there's something
I want, need to do.

209
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,518
[Laura] <i>Something you want</i>
<i>to do?</i>

210
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:58,622
[Ichika] Yes, I want to
protect someone.

211
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:01,527
And I need to use
everything I have...

212
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,597
to fight to protect that person.

213
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,703
[Laura] <i>But that sounds exactly</i>
<i>like her.</i>

214
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:10,807
[Ichika] You're right.

215
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:15,714
And I intend to protect
you in the same way,
Miss Laura Bodewig.

216
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,023
But I am not...

217
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,365
Mentor, what has happened to me?

218
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,736
This matter is of
utmost importance,

219
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,573
and also highly classified.

220
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,776
What do you know of the
VT System?

221
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:40,250
You're talking about the
Valkyrie Trace System?

222
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,685
[Chifuyu] Yes...

223
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,487
Its research,
development and usage...

224
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:47,326
have all been completely
prohibited by the
International IS Treaty.

225
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:52,634
However, it appears that your IS
was in fact equipped with it.

226
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:58,943
More over, it seems it was
set to activate only under
situations where there was
extensive damage,

227
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:03,717
and the pilot's mental condition
was completely and totally
focused on winning.

228
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,586
You willed it to happen.

229
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:09,658
[Laura] It happened because
I wished for it?

230
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,563
[Chifuyu] Laura Bodewig!

231
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:14,432
Yes, ma'am!

232
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,002
[Chifuyu] Who are you?

233
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,870
I am...

234
00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:21,475
[Chifuyu] If you're no one,
then that's perfect.

235
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,614
From now on, you are just
Laura Bodewig.

236
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:34,629
But remember, you will never
be able to become me.

237
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,908
[giggling]

238
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,047
[Charles] Well, they ended up
canceling the tournament.

239
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:49,984
Never the less, they still want
to collect everyone's data,

240
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,555
so we will get to fight
one round each.

241
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,531
The chance to win it is
gone now...

242
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:00,967
To win a date...

243
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,235
Waaah!

244
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,772
[crying]

245
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:15,153
[Ichika] By the way, Houki,
about that promise from
last month...

246
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,893
I don't mind going out with you.

247
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:20,661
You what?

248
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,065
I said, I don't mind going‐

249
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:26,036
Really? Are you sure about that?
Do you really, really mean it?

250
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,271
Uh, well, yeah...

251
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:28,607
Why?!

252
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,110
I mean, please explain your
reasons to me.

253
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:35,182
Well, you're my good childhood
friend so why shouldn't
I go, right?

254
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,184
[Houki] Right!

255
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,421
It's just shopping‐

256
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,925
I knew you would say something
like that!

257
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:49,069
[Charles] Oh Ichika, sometimes
I really do wonder if you do
things like that on purpose.

258
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,642
[Maya] Orimura! Dunois!
I've got some wonderful news!

259
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,678
I know you went through
a lot earlier,

260
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:58,550
but I'd thought you'd like to
know that we've finally managed
to get both of you...

261
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,619
a wonderful place that
will reward you!

262
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,756
[Ichika] Huh?
[Charles] What place?

263
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:06,728
That's right! It's a new
men's bathhouse!

264
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:12,470
How refreshing.

265
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,705
[door opening]

266
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:15,708
[Charles] Um,
please excuse me...

267
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:17,944
What the‐?!

268
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:24,187
Don't stare at me you...

269
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,723
you pervert, Ichika.

270
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,725
Guh! Sorry!

271
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,163
What do you think you're doing?!

272
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:33,334
Does it bother you that
I'm in here?

273
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,169
No, it's not like that, but...

274
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,206
You know, I figured I should
check out the bath,

275
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:40,811
but if it bothers you that much,
I can go and leave now.

276
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,015
Uh, n‐no, please!
I'll leave instead!

277
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,282
I've enjoyed the bath already.

278
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,719
[Charles] No, wait!

279
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,756
I need to tell you something.

280
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:49,991
It's something important,

281
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,729
so I want you to hear
me out, okay?

282
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:56,200
All right.

283
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,939
[Charles] Well, it's about what
I told you before.

284
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,277
Uh, you mean about you staying
at the academy?

285
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:05,213
Yes, that's right.

286
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:08,251
I think I will stay here
after all.

287
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:13,525
[Charles] Because you're here,
Ichika, I think I want to be
here too.

288
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,995
Oh, I see.

289
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:19,568
[Charles] Besides that,
I've decided one more thing...

290
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,403
about the way I should be.

291
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,377
About the way you should be?

292
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:29,815
[Charles] From now on, would you
please call me Charlotte?

293
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,186
But only when we are
by ourselves.

294
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,588
Could you do that?

295
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,657
[Ichika] I‐Is that your real...

296
00:20:35,757 --> 00:20:37,894
Oui, that is my real name.

297
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:41,900
The name my maman gave
me on the day that I was born.

298
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,336
As you wish...

299
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:46,940
Miss Charlotte.

300
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,976
Bon.

301
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:57,155
I'd like to introduce you to a
new transfer student today...

302
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:05,134
Hello, I am Charlotte Dunois.

303
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:08,404
And it is very nice to be
meeting all of you once again.

304
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:13,145
[class] Huh?!
[Maya] Uh, yes, it seems
Mr. Dunois turned out to
be a Miss...

305
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:15,114
[Maya] We were kind of
shocked too.

306
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,220
[girl 1] So you mean Dunois is
really a girl?!

307
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,223
[girl 2] I knew there was
something fishy about it!

308
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,493
[girl 3] He wasn't a beautiful
boy, but a beautiful girl!

309
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:26,865
[girl 1] Wait, Orimura's been
sharing the same room without
knowing anything about it!

310
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:28,701
[girl 2] Wait a second!
[girl 1] That means...

311
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,272
[girl 2] Didn't they open
the large bath to the boys
last night?!
[boom]

312
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:34,176
[screaming]

313
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,712
Ichika!

314
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:39,416
No, for the love of God,
don't shoot!

315
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,953
I'm really going to die!

316
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,429
Am I not dead yet?

317
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:51,401
Laura!

318
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,071
[Ichika] You saved me!
Thank you! I‐

319
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:09,233
Now, I have decided that I am
going to make you my bride!

320
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,059
That is final, and I will not
accept any objections from you!

321
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:14,057
[everyone] What?!

322
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,691
Huh?

323
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,691
Wha‐?!

324
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:54,563
[girl 1] At last, a hot steamy
summer has finally arrived!

325
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,583
[girl 2] And since it's summer,
we'll all be going to the beach
of course!

326
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,617
[girl 3] And tomorrow
happens to be Sunday!

327
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:01,583
[girl 1] We should all go
shopping together!

328
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:04,083
[girl 2] Shopping?
But what are we going to buy?

329
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:05,483
[girl 1] Swimsuits of course!

330
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,183
We're girls and we've got to
work it on the beach!

331
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,850
[girl 2] It's the next episode:
"Ocean's Eleven!"

332
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,450
[girl 3] Hey, it looks like we
weren't the only ones who came
here to buy swimsuits.

333
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,050
[girl 1] Yeah! I see her,
her and her too!
