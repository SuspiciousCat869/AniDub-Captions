1
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:16,089
For today's lesson, we're going
to practice operating the basic
controls of the IS.

2
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,561
[Chifuyu] Orimura, Alcott,
you're up first.

3
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:21,531
Not a problem.

4
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,348
Okay!

5
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:36,686
What's the matter with
this darn thing?

6
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,088
Move it, Orimura.

7
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,858
Any experienced IS pilot...

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,327
should take less than a second
to deploy.

9
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,666
Just focus...

10
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,203
Engage, Byakushiki!

11
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:53,543
Hey, it worked!

12
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:54,879
Good, now fly.

13
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,347
Right!

14
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,322
Right. Up, up and‐ oh God!

15
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,702
[girls] Oooh...

16
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:16,944
[Chifuyu] You're too slow!

17
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,246
According to the output specs,

18
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,349
the Byakushiki is superior
to her IS!

19
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:24,355
That may technically be true,
but right now I'm focusing my
imagination on...

20
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:27,226
on deploying the pyramid part
forward, okay?

21
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,195
Aw man, I'm just not getting
this at all.

22
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:31,365
[Cecilia] An image is nothing
more than an image.

23
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:35,538
But it'll be far more productive
if you can figure out the method
that works easiest for you.

24
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:39,710
Yeah, well, in the first place,
I still haven't even gotten
use to flying the IS around
just yet.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,980
Heck, I'm not even sure
what makes it fly.

26
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:48,189
Well, uh, if you're interested,
I'd be happy to give you lessons
everyday after school.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,159
And when I do, it'll be
just the two of us...

28
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,766
[Chifuyu] Orimura, Alcott,
execute a power dive and then
come to a complete stop.

29
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,802
Right, roger that.

30
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:58,672
Well, ladies first.

31
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,815
Wow, she totally nailed it.

32
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:07,484
Now let's see how I do.

33
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:12,892
Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

34
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,327
[screaming]

35
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:51,334
[boom]

36
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,572
Ichika!

37
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:56,442
Orimura!

38
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,614
[Maya] Are you okay?

39
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:08,826
Oh man... I seriously thought
I was going to die.

40
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:12,831
You moron! Do you know how much
it costs to fill in a hole
this size?

41
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,435
I'm sorry about that...

42
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:17,638
That's pitiful, Ichika.

43
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,543
You still haven't mastered
a single that I've taught‐

44
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,414
[Houki] Hey!

45
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,917
Goodness! Are you all right,
Ichika dear?

46
00:04:26,018 --> 00:04:27,252
Have you been injured?

47
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:30,324
Uh, no, I'm okay. Honestly.

48
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,360
Wait, "Ichika dear"?!

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,330
I'm so glad to hear you
say that.

50
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,032
Still, I do think you it would
be best for you...

51
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,503
to get checked out thoroughly
at the nurse's office.

52
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,938
In fact, I'll even go with you‐

53
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:41,039
[Houki] Not necessary.

54
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,909
It's impossible for anyone
to get injured...

55
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,377
while piloting an IS.

56
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,046
Oh, Miss Shinonono.

57
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:49,251
Please understand, it's
only natural for me to
care about others.

58
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:52,055
Oh yeah, because your bosom
overflows with human kindness.

59
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:55,861
Yes, it does, and it's so much
more pleasent than scowling
like a troll!

60
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:03,905
<i>I don't get it. Exactly when</i>
<i>did those two start hating</i>
<i>each other so much?</i>

61
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:08,446
[Rinin] So, this is the
IS Acaedmy.

62
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:14,154
[Tanimoto] Orimura,
congratulations on your
inauguration as class rep!

63
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:16,591
[girls] Congratulations!

64
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,495
Wait, how did I become the
class representative?

65
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:22,767
Oh, you were promoted because
I decided to step down!

66
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:25,070
Obviously, it's true that you
did lose the match,

67
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,807
but if you think about it,
that outcome was inevitable.

68
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,345
After all, what else could
possibly happen with me as
your opponent?

69
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:35,919
Well, I just felt awful for
behaving so childishly and
getting upset afterward,

70
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,923
so I decided to let you be
the class representative.

71
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:41,960
Wow! That's so considerate
of you, Cecilia!

72
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,129
I totally agree!

73
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,032
Since he's the only male
student at the academy,

74
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,202
we have to give him, like,
our full support!

75
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,040
Aren't you Mr. Popularity?

76
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,611
Huh? You really think so?

77
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,982
And exactly why are you in such
a bad mood anyway?

78
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,822
Hello there! I'm from
the newspaper club!

79
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:03,959
Oh, Cecilia, if you don't mind,
would you get into the
picture too?

80
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,297
What? You mean,
just the two of us?

81
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:10,435
Oh, you and your personal units
are the center of attention!

82
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,440
It'd look even better if
you guys shake hands
or something.

83
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,543
Oh, do you really think so?

84
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:19,715
You will make certain that
I receive copies of the
pictures as well, won't you?

85
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:21,484
Oh, sure! No problem!

86
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,621
Come on, stand up.

87
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:28,562
Alright, can I get you guys
to shake hands for me?

88
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:32,133
[Mayuzumi] Now, get a little
closer and just give me a
big smile!

89
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,104
Very good, just relax!

90
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,840
Say cheese!

91
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,213
Why are all of you
my picture?

92
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,615
Just calm down.

93
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,618
We can't let you get ahead of
us all by yourself!

94
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,222
[nervous laughing]

95
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:59,707
So, I guess that you had
a lot of fun today.

96
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,442
It just made me feel exhausted.

97
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:04,547
Do you honestly think you
would enjoy it if you were
in my shoes?

98
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,717
Well, if I had to hazard
a guess...

99
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,354
I think I actually would
enjoy it!

100
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:11,724
What was that for?

101
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,660
I'm going to change into
my pajamas now,

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,431
so I need you to look away.

103
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,503
I don't understand why you
didn't change earlier while
I was brushing my teeth.

104
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:21,939
Hmph.

105
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,822
[ziiip]

106
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,153
[Houki] Alright. I'm done.
[Ichika] Oh.

107
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:03,565
Hey, are you wearing a new
belt tonight?

108
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:05,768
Actually, yes. I can't
believe you noticed.

109
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,738
Well yeah, of course I noticed.

110
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,574
I mean I look at you all
the time, you know?

111
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:13,413
Well yeah, of course you do.
I mean I'm right here and
you're there.

112
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:15,783
Well that's perfectly normal.

113
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,821
Alright, it's time to
go to sleep!

114
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,371
Um, Ichika...

115
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,773
[Ichika] Uh huh?

116
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:35,678
I just, well I, I'm sorry.

117
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,781
I was frustrated.

118
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,150
That's all right.

119
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,418
Don't worry, okay?

120
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:43,457
Oh, good. That's nice to know.

121
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,925
Um, goodnight then.

122
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,195
You too. Sleep tight.

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,836
[students] Good morning!

124
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,710
[girl 1] The class league match
is coming up soon.

125
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,484
Oh that's right! Have you heard
that the representative for
Class 1‐2 has been changed?

126
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,922
Yeah, now it's that
new transfer student,
what's‐her‐face.

127
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,726
A transfer student?
At this time of the year?

128
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:11,898
Yeah, supposedly she's
from China.

129
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:16,671
I wonder if she transfered to
the IS Academy in order to
study my techniques?

130
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,741
Well I'm sure curious.
I bet she's good.

131
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:23,347
Well, the only classes with a
student with a personal IS
are Classes 1 and 4,

132
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:24,316
so we'll be fine.

133
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,685
[Rinin] That information
is outdated.

134
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:30,725
The class representative for
Class 2 now has a personal
IS as well.

135
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,262
So it's not going to be as
easy to win anymore.

136
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:36,399
No way! Is that really you,
Rinin?

137
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:40,239
That's right! I'm Rinin Fan,
China's representative
contender.

138
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,575
And I have come here today
to declare war!

139
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,112
[girl 2] So, that's the transfer
student from Class 2.

140
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,582
[girl 3] The representative
contender from China?

141
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,017
Exactly who is that new girl?

142
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:51,856
She seems much too friendly
with Ichika.

143
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,693
Good one. Coming in and acting
like a show‐off.

144
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,295
[Ichika] It's so unlike
you, Rinin!

145
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,933
What? Why would you say
something like that about
me, huh?

146
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,570
[Rinin] That hurt!

147
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,305
What did you do that for?!

148
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:06,242
Consider that your homeroom
bell being rung.

149
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:08,045
Ch‐Chifuyu?!

150
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,381
That's Ms. Orimura.

151
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,884
Now get back to your class.
You're in the way.

152
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,887
I'm sorry, ma'am.

153
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,261
Okay, but I'll be back later,
so don't you run away, Ichika!

154
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:25,070
You mean she's a representative
contender too?

155
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:29,042
[Ichika] You could've knocked
me over.

156
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:32,014
I can't believe that you're
Class 2's new transfer.

157
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,649
You should have contacted me.

158
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,218
Don't be stupid.
If I had done that,

159
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,688
it would have totally ruined
our dramatic reunion.

160
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,661
Ah ha ha, and maybe because you
still have some issues with my
big sister, Chifuyu?

161
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,997
No, I don't have issues
with her.

162
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:47,937
It's just that I'm not good
at handling her.

163
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,810
Ramen. Same order as always.

164
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,514
It's been a whole year since
I last saw you.

165
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,782
So, how have things been?

166
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,752
Look, I've been doing
just great, really!

167
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:02,390
Maybe you're the one who ought
to get sick or injured for
a change!

168
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:04,961
And what in the heck is
that supposed to mean?

169
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,509
Man, I can't believe you become
a representative contender.

170
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,881
And what about you?
It knocked me over when
I saw you on the news.

171
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,451
You think you were surprised?
The last thing I'd have
thought...

172
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,654
is that I'd end up in a
place like this.

173
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:27,193
I heard that you operated an
IS at the entrance exam?

174
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:29,863
But how on earth could something
like that happen?

175
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:33,202
To be honest, I couldn't tell
you how...

176
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:35,171
[Ichika] You know that the high
school entrance exams...

177
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:38,543
are held in the city's big,
multi‐purpose facility, right?

178
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:41,747
Well, I got lost in it.

179
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:44,451
And even though I asked a lot
of people for help,

180
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,487
everything they told
me was useless.

181
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,370
That's an IS...

182
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,323
Wha‐? Guh, no way!

183
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:12,659
[Ichika] It just moved!

184
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,994
[door opening]

185
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,596
[woman] Hey there, you're not
allowed in here!

186
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:18,701
Look! I think that IS is
responding to him!

187
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,136
That's impossible!

188
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:23,741
[woman] There's no way a boy
can control an IS!

189
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,179
Well, a whole lot of crap
happened after that.

190
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,248
Next thing I knew, I was
enrolled in this school.

191
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,352
Huh. That is weird.

192
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:35,592
Ichika, I think it's about
time that you to gave me
an explanation!

193
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,495
That's right! You had better
explain this!

194
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:40,933
Don't tell me you're
actually dating this
transfer student now!

195
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,604
No, it's not like that at all,
I swear!

196
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,106
It's true!

197
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:48,477
We're just childhood friends.

198
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:51,281
[Ichika] What's wrong with you?
[Rinin] Nothing's wrong! I'm
fine!

199
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:52,950
Childhood friends?

200
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,686
Oh that's right.

201
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:57,657
I forgot Rinin transferred to
our school right after you
moved away.

202
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,092
That's Houki Shinonono...

203
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,594
I've told you about her.

204
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:03,265
Houki was my very first
childhood friend,

205
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,537
and later you became my second
childhood friend.

206
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,873
I'm first...?

207
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,177
Uh huh. Now I see...

208
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:14,348
It's nice to meet one of
Ichika's old friends.

209
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,351
Yes, nice to meet you.

210
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:21,492
Ahem. Since you seem to have
forgetten about me, allow me
to introduce myself!

211
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,798
I am Cecilia Alcott,
the United Kingdom's
representative contender.

212
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:28,268
As a matter of fact, Ichika and
I had a fierce battle over...

213
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:31,706
[Rinin] So I heart that you were
recently chosen to be Class 1's
representative.

214
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,876
[Ichika] Um, yeah. That's what
happened.
[Cecilia] [continues to talk]

215
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:36,947
You know, if you want, I could
help you with your IS
practice drills.

216
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,316
Wouldn't that be fun?!

217
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,219
Well, yeah,
that would help, sure.

218
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,523
Ah! Look here! Are you
listening to me?!

219
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,060
Sorry, I'm just not interested.

220
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,596
I can't believe you
said that.

221
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,333
And in any case, it's my job
to teach Ichika!

222
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,902
You're from Class 2,
aren't you?

223
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,272
I'm not looking for any
assistance from the enemy!

224
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,542
Look, I'm having a nice chat
with Ichika, right now.

225
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:59,547
We weren't talking to you,
so you need to back off.

226
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:06,089
Well, you certainly have a lot
of nerve! You're the one who
entered the picture after
we did!

227
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,691
Actually, it wasn't after you.

228
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,628
I mean, I've known him longer
than you have.

229
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:12,098
Don't go there, because I've
known him longer than you have!

230
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,302
In fact, we're so close,
Ichika's eaten at my
house several times!

231
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,574
Oh, mine too.
What a coincidence!

232
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:21,679
[Rinin] Ichika used to come to
my house and eat with us all
the time.

233
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,648
Ever since he was in
elementary school.

234
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:25,885
Ichika, just what is she
talking about...

235
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,820
and how come you've never
mentioned any of this before?!

236
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,857
You've never mentioned it
to me either!

237
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,264
I used to go eat at the Chinese
restaurant her family owned,
that's all.

238
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:35,832
Oh, a restaurant.

239
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,068
At least that makes sense.

240
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,636
Well, if her family owned
a restaurant,

241
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,075
I supposed it's only natural
that you would've eaten there.

242
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,679
So Rinin, how's your dad doing?

243
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,184
I think he's okay.

244
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,320
[school bell]

245
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,756
Alright, I'll see you
after school.

246
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:55,427
I'll come by around the time
you're finished practicing
with them,

247
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,631
so make sure you're
available, okay?

248
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:06,644
What the devil is going on
around here Miss Shinonono?
And how did you‐

249
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:09,648
[Houki] I've been given
clearance to utilize the
training IS.

250
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:12,419
And I'll be using it for
Ichika's intensive training.

251
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,124
Now hold on, that's the Japanese
production IS.

252
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:20,464
How on earth could she have
possibly obtained clearance
to use the Uchigane?

253
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,906
All right, Ichika, let's begin.

254
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,909
Oh, yeah, right!

255
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,511
You wait just one minute!

256
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:33,215
I'm the one who's supposed to
be conducting Ichika's training!

257
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,753
[Cecilia] Do you hear me?!

258
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,224
Concentrate, Ichika. We'll start
your lesson now.

259
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,962
No, let me start your
lesson, Ichika.

260
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,378
[Cecilia] Well, I suppose we can
call it a day now, can't we?

261
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,114
[Ichika] Uh huh...

262
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:58,318
[Houki] You feel that way
because you haven't kept
up your training.

263
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,855
Come on! That was two against
one out there!

264
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:04,127
Well then, Ichika,
I'll see you later then.

265
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,331
What are you still doing
down there?

266
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:09,401
We should head back to
our room now.

267
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,404
Yeah, you go on ahead.

268
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,307
I can't move my legs.

269
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,376
What am I going to do about you?

270
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,980
Alright, I'll go ahead
and use the shower first.

271
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,416
Yeah, fine.

272
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:28,495
I wonder if it's going to be as
bad as this all the way up to
the class league match?

273
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:30,698
[Rinin] Hey, good work out
there, Ichika!

274
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:35,038
You're okay with a sports
drink, aren't you? Here!

275
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:39,144
Ah, thanks Rinin. Have you
really been waiting for
me all this time?

276
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:41,213
You could say that.

277
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,524
[Rinin] So, we're finally
alone together.

278
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,627
Yeah, I guess so.

279
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,667
Ichika...

280
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:57,070
I was wondering if you
missed me after I moved?

281
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,940
Well, I suppose having one less
friend to hang out with...

282
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,743
did make me feel a little
bit lonelier.

283
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,245
That's not what I meant!

284
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,849
I'm a childhood friend you
haven't seen for a long time.

285
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,587
And I know you've got something
to say to me!

286
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,657
Oh yeah, I forgot something
very important!

287
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:15,730
Have you contacted any other
friends from school, yet?

288
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,237
I mean to tell them you were
back in Japan. I bet
they'd thrilled!

289
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,707
That's not it!
I was talking about‐

290
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,377
Hey, look, I need to get back
to my room, okay?

291
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:30,218
I'm freezing and hopefully
Houki's done with our shower
by now.

292
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:31,586
Shower?

293
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,589
And Houki's that girl
I met earlier?

294
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:35,892
What kind of relationship do
you two have?

295
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,997
Well we're just
childhood friends.

296
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,333
She was my first...

297
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,902
and of course you were
my second.

298
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:46,241
But what does being childhood
friends have to do with taking
a shower?!

299
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:50,147
Oh that! That's because Houki
and I are sharing a room
right now.

300
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,449
What?!

301
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,017
Well yeah, they couldn't get
me my own room,

302
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:54,053
so we're, you know...

303
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:55,588
So what you're telling me
is that you...

304
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,758
and this Houki person are
living together?!

305
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,996
Yeah, kind of. But thank
goodness it's with Houki.

306
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:02,798
If it were someone
I didn't know,

307
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:06,070
I'd be nervous and I'd never be
able to get any sleep.

308
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,609
Hey, what's wrong?

309
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,415
It's okay because she's
your childhood friend.

310
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:15,884
What I said was,
you don't mind...

311
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:18,254
because she's your
childhood friend!

312
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:21,926
And that is why we need
to switch rooms!

313
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:23,728
Is your brain malfunctioning?

314
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,063
Why switch with me?

315
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,367
Well, I figured it must be
horrible for you...

316
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,869
having to share a room
with a guy.

317
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,206
But I never said that sharing
with him was horrible.

318
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:34,076
Besides this issue is between
me and Ichika, got it?

319
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:37,281
[Rinin] Oh, don't worry!
After all, I'm his
childhood friend too!

320
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,919
[Rinin] Right?
[Ichika] I don't know why
you're looking at me!

321
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:42,422
In any case, I will not switch
rooms with you!

322
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,158
Now, go back to your own room!

323
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,829
Oh, by the way, Ichika,

324
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,965
do you still remember
our promise?

325
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:49,766
Promise?

326
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:51,669
[Rinin] Mmhmm. From school.

327
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,672
Stop ignoring me, you trollop!

328
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:55,441
Okay, it's come to this...

329
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,344
Not in the house!

330
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,653
A full partial deployment!
And fast!

331
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:08,025
You know, a normal person
would have been seriously
injured by that.

332
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:12,065
[Rinin] Well, nevermind.

333
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,805
Hey, I almost forgot!

334
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,108
You were just talking about
some kind of promise.

335
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,878
What was it about?

336
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:24,149
Right, well, you know...

337
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:25,951
It was just...

338
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:28,088
You do remember it, right?

339
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,456
Let's see...

340
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:32,661
Oh, was it that I'd eat your
sweet and sour pork every day...

341
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:33,797
if you become a better cook?

342
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:35,232
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

343
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,101
[Ichika] And it'd be
you're treat, right?

344
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:39,305
[Rinin] What?
[Ichika] That's right.

345
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:43,043
You promised you would treat me
to a meal everyday, wasn't
that it?

346
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:46,080
That would be awesome since
I'm single and‐

347
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,085
What a jerk!

348
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,355
Uh, just hold on there Rinin...

349
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,560
How can you not remember a
sacred promise you made
to a girl?!

350
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,696
You're the most despicable
guy ever!

351
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,098
I hope a dog bites you to death!

352
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,900
I don't understand why
you're so mad!

353
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,570
I did remember the promise!

354
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,741
But you didn't get the meaning
of it! You didn't get
the meaning!

355
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:07,011
Well then maybe you need to
explain it to me!

356
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,813
[Ichika] What the hell's
the meaning?!

357
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,450
You want me to explain it?!

358
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,821
How could I do that with
someone who's so dense?

359
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,826
How about this, then?

360
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,729
In the next week's class
league match,

361
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,834
the winner will get to make the
loser do any one thing that he
or she wants!

362
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,237
[Rinin] What do you say?
[Ichika] Sure, why not?

363
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,175
And if I win, I'm going to make
you explain it to me!

364
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,850
And you had better be ready
for it, you understand?!

365
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,194
[door opening and closing]

366
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,397
[Houki] Ichika...

367
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,865
Yeah, what is it now?

368
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,136
I hope a horse kicks you
to death!

369
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,513
[students murmuring]

370
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:10,570
Man, Rinin's my opponent
in the first match?

371
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,205
[Maya] Her IS called Shenlong.

372
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:15,910
This model is a close‐combat
type just like your Byakushiki.

373
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,915
This match is not going to be
the same as the one between
you and me,

374
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:20,817
so please don't let your
guard down.

375
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,153
Don't get too stressed out.

376
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,555
You can win as long
as you fight...

377
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,224
like you would during practice.

378
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:31,333
Geez, I bet it would really hurt
to get hit by that thing.

379
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:33,803
[announcement] Will both
contestants...

380
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,640
move to your designated
positions at this time?

381
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,160
If you apologize now,

382
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,697
I'll lower the intensity of the
pain you're about to endure.

383
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,566
I don't need any favors
from you!

384
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,935
Hit me with your best shot!

385
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,437
Fine! But for your information,

386
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:59,808
the "absolute defense"
isn't so perfect.

387
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:02,645
If your attack is powerful
enough to rip through
the shield,

388
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:06,327
it's possible for you to damage
the opponent badly enough,
but not kill them.

389
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:11,193
[Ichika] I know that!
[announcement] Both contestants,
you may commence the match at
this time!

390
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:56,127
[girl 1] At last, the duel
between Ichika Orimura and
Rinin Fan has finally begun!

391
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,727
[girl 2] Orimura's got a plan!

392
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,127
[girl 3] But his opponent has a
third generation type weapon!

393
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,860
[girl 1] Is there even a chance
that Byakushiki can win?

394
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,193
[girl 2] Go Orimura!

395
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:06,593
[girl 1] Yeah! Show everyone
that you're a man!

396
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:09,127
[girl 3] The next episode:
"The Class League Match"

397
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:11,093
[girl 1] Don't you dare miss
the unexpected ending!

398
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:14,193
[girl 2] And remember! Being
"hot" is a very important
quality for girls!

399
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:18,093
[girl 3] But please keep in mind
that "hot" also refers to fire
and burning!
