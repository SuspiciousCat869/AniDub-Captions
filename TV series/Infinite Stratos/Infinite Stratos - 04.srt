1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:05,058
[Rinin] Ichika, I was wondering
if you missed me after I moved?

2
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:08,428
[Ichika] You promised that
you would treat me to a meal
everyday, wasn't that it?

3
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,096
[Rinin] What a jerk!

4
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:13,532
[Ichika] Geez, I bet it would
really hurt to hit by that
thing.

5
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:03,999
Not bad.

6
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,135
You were actually able to stop
my first attack.

7
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:09,003
[Rinin] But that won't last.

8
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,049
[squealing, cheering]

9
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,854
Ichika!

10
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:32,057
Come on! What on earth
is he doing out there?!

11
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,860
You should be using the
cross‐grid turn I taught you!

12
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,095
Have you forgotten how
to do it?!

13
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:53,209
<i>At this rate, the match is</i>
<i>going to be pretty grueling.</i>

14
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,478
<i>I need to create some distance.</i>

15
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,618
So naive!

16
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,888
[Ichika] Guh!

17
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,892
[laughing]

18
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,728
And that was what you would
call a jab!

19
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,344
What the hell kind of
attack did she use?

20
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,080
What she used was
a shock cannon.

21
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,682
It's a weapon that manipulates
the barometric pressure...

22
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,217
of the surrounding atmosphere.

23
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,352
That's right. The Shenlong is a
third generation model IS,

24
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,722
just like my own Blue Tears.

25
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,967
[Rinin] You're dodging
pretty well.

26
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:03,607
I thought the invisible barrel
and ammunition were supposedly
this Ryuho's features,
however...

27
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,708
There's something else about
the shock cannon...

28
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:09,212
It fires at any angle unlimited
by its barrel's angle of skew.

29
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:12,981
So what you're saying is,
it doesn't have a blind spot.

30
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,783
Yes, I'm afraid that's
exactly right.

31
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,856
[Ichika] <i>If I don't make some</i>
<i>kind of preemptive strike,</i>
<i>she's going to win!</i>

32
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,926
<i>I have to get it together!</i>

33
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:27,894
<i>I'm using the exact same</i>
<i>machine that Chifuyu uses.</i>

34
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:44,109
So, is the Yukihira Nigata the
only weapon the Byakushiki has?

35
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,546
And I won the championship
using only that.

36
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,615
Just one swing is good enough
to win.

37
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:55,686
You know, I really wish you
wouldn't put me in the same
category as the world champion.

38
00:04:55,787 --> 00:05:00,658
If you want to be realistic,
an amateur like you doesn't
have a chance of winning a
shooting battle.

39
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:05,495
[Chifuyu] Do you know anything
about recoil control, how to
distance youself from the
bullet line,

40
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:07,797
one‐zero stop, absolute turns...

41
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,933
What about ammo characteristics,
atmospheric conditions?

42
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,802
Or the intellectual aspects
of battle?

43
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,304
Such as the influence caused by
the opponent's equipment?

44
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,574
And that's only the beginning,
so can you handle all that?

45
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:20,609
Well can you?!

46
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,345
[Ichika] I'm sorry...

47
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:29,084
Look, I know you pretty well and
mastering one technique is
really more your style.

48
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:32,653
After all, you are my
brother, right?

49
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,625
<i>The barrier‐disabling attack...</i>

50
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,028
<i>Can I use it?</i>

51
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,398
[Ichika] Rinin...
[Rinin] Yeah, what is it?

52
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:49,602
[Ichika] Look, I'm warning you.
I'm not going to hold back.

53
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:50,769
What's that mean?

54
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,938
That's what you're supposed
to do!

55
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,042
Besides, I'll show you that we
are not in the same league!

56
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:04,716
It looks like Orimura's thinking
about trying something.

57
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:07,284
My guess is that he's using
the ignition boost.

58
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:08,752
Exactly like I taught him.

59
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,054
Hold on, what is this
ignition boost?

60
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:16,292
It's a form of surprise attack
in which you close in on your
opponent at a maximum rate
of speed.

61
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:18,928
As long as he can ignite at just
the right moment,

62
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,498
he even can go toe‐to‐to with
a representative contender.

63
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:23,933
Unfortunately...

64
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,670
This is his only chance because
it just works once.

65
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,056
[crack]

66
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:52,258
[boom]

67
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:57,029
What the‐?

68
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,600
[students] What happened?!

69
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,201
Did the attack miss?
Is it an Earthquake?

70
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,337
What? What in the devil
just happened out there?

71
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:07,505
Ichika?

72
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:09,407
The system's been damaged!

73
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:13,177
An unidentified object appears
to have penetrated the arena's
deflection shield!

74
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,244
Suspend the match!

75
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:16,747
Orimura, Fan, get out of
there immediately!

76
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:21,651
[siren]
[screaming]

77
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,020
Hey, what's happening?

78
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,855
What in the hell's going on?

79
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,790
Ichika, the match is canceled!

80
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,525
Get back to the pit now!

81
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,961
[Ichika] But wha‐ Huh?
Another IS?

82
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,997
And there's no indentification
on it?

83
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,932
Is it locking me out somehow?

84
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,166
How can it be locked?!

85
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,468
What are you doing?!
Get back to the pit!

86
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,970
Get back? And what are you
going to do?

87
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,373
[Rinin] I'm going to buy us some
time, but you need to get out of
here right now!

88
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:49,843
Now wait a second! There's no
way I'm going to leave a
girl behind!

89
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:54,147
You idiot! You're the weaker
fighter, so you don't get
any choice! Now move!

90
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,016
What?

91
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:59,852
It's not like I'm going to
handle this all the way to
the end okay?

92
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:01,421
I'm standing in...

93
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:04,790
until one of the teachers can
get out here and handle it.

94
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,426
Look out!

95
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,762
A beam weapon?

96
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:14,298
And it has a higher power output
than Cecilia's IS.

97
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,901
Hey, you idiot! You need to
let go of me right now!

98
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,937
Woah, stop moving around!

99
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:22,373
[Rinin] Shut up! Shut up!
[Ichika] Don't hit me!
Quit willing!

100
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,007
Here it comes!

101
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,659
Just what is that damn thing?

102
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,728
It not any IS I've ever
heard of.

103
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:49,164
Alright, you! Identify yourself!

104
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:53,301
[Ichika] Answer me! Who are you?

105
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,369
What are you doing here?

106
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,173
[Maya] Orimura, Fan!

107
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,375
You need to vacate the
arena at once!

108
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,044
The teachers will be there
soon with their IS units to
neutralize the situation.

109
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,115
No, we've got to keep it
occupied until everyone
evacuates!

110
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,986
I understand how you must feel
about this, but you just can't
do that!

111
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,220
Get out of there now!

112
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,389
[Cecilia] Ichika, run!
[Houki] Ichika!

113
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,026
Are you okay with this?

114
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,128
Are you talking to me, you jerk?

115
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,631
Can't you see that all I want is
for you to let me go?

116
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,266
[Rinin] I can't even move with
you holding me like this!

117
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,534
[Ichika] Oh, sorry.

118
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,151
[Rinin] It looks like she's
ready to do this.

119
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,720
[Ichika] Yeah, let's say
you're right.

120
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,021
Ichika...

121
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,190
How 'bout you charge at her
while I cover you?

122
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,592
That's your only weapon right?

123
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:00,928
More or less.

124
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,131
Right, let's do it.

125
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,013
[Ichika] Rinin! Wait!

126
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:27,919
[boom, boom, boom]

127
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,688
Orimura, please come in!

128
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,390
If you can hear me,
please respond!

129
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,460
Are either of you listening
to me? Fan, Orimura!

130
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,562
They said they could handle the
situation, didn't they?

131
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:40,664
So I say we let them go for it.

132
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,699
What? Please say that you're
not serious!

133
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,669
How can you say something like
that at a time like this?

134
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,036
Oh, calm down.

135
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:49,005
Just chill and have a cup of
coffee or something.

136
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:52,575
[Chifuyu] You're only
stressing because your
body's running low on sugar.

137
00:10:55,911 --> 00:11:01,116
Um, before you drink that, what
you actually just added was
the salt.

138
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,389
Ichika...

139
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:15,462
Please, ma'am, give me
authorization to use my IS!

140
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,698
I can move out right away!

141
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,166
I wish I could do that, but...

142
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,002
Well...

143
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,840
The arena's deflection shield's
setting is currently at
Level 4.

144
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,643
And on top of that,
all the doors have been
automatically sealed.

145
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,380
Did that IS cause this?

146
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,282
It seems so.

147
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,952
As things stand,
we can't evacuate...

148
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:44,087
and we can't go in and stage
a rescue either.

149
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,564
[panic]

150
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:58,367
Very well, then! Deem this
an emergency and ask for
government support!

151
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:04,373
We've done that. The senior
elites are doing their best
to crack the system even as
we speak.

152
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,342
[Chifuyu] And just as soon as
they have the deflecting
shield under control,

153
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,978
we'll be sending in the troops.

154
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,313
So I guess that means that
for right now,

155
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,315
the only thing we can
do here is wait.

156
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:17,552
That's right. But you couldn't
help the shock troops in
any case,

157
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,987
so there's no reason for you
to worry about it.

158
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,456
Exactly what are you trying
to say?

159
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:26,393
I'm saying that Blue Tears is
designed to fight multiple
opponents by itself.

160
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:30,629
Which means that if you tried
to work with a group, you'd just
be getting in everyone's way.

161
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,465
No! That isn't true! I wouldn't!

162
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,867
How could you think I'd do
something like that?

163
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,002
So have you had group training?

164
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:39,071
What was your position
on the team?

165
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,173
[Chifuyu] What was your ally's
formation?
[Cecilia] But‐

166
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:42,940
[Chifuyu] How did your squad
assess the enemy?

167
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,676
And what was the duration
of the operation?

168
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,546
All right then, I give up!
You made your point already!

169
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:53,017
[Chifuyu] I hope so. You need
to understand why things are
as they are.

170
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,423
Ichika, do it now!

171
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:02,592
[screaming]

172
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,931
Oh you idiot!

173
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,699
Aim that thing like you're
supposed to!

174
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,334
That was your fourth
try already!

175
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,170
Hey, I am aiming it, damnit!

176
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,071
[Ichika] <i>Aw crap...</i>

177
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,372
<i>I'll only be able to use the...</i>

178
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:20,742
<i>barrier‐disabling attack one</i>
<i>more time.</i>

179
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,610
[Rinin] Ichika, break away!

180
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,345
[Ichika] R‐Right!

181
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,218
[Rinin] What are we going to do?

182
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:34,787
We'll never beat her without
some kind of strategy.

183
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:37,924
Hey, you can still run if
you want to.

184
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,359
Who said anything about
running, you jerk?

185
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,895
I'm still a representative
contender, you know!

186
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:48,099
All right! How's this sound?
You take the point and I'll
cover your rear end!

187
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:55,206
That's appreci‐

188
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,508
Stay focused!

189
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,044
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know!

190
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:23,966
You know what? Don't you think
that that thing's movements look
a little too mechanical?

191
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,133
Hmm? What do you mean?

192
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,835
It is a machine, you know.

193
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,171
No, that's not what I'm
talking about.

194
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:34,075
I'm wonder if there's really
anyone piloting it?

195
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:37,711
What? But an IS won't work
without a pilot...

196
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,916
[Rinin] Now that you
mention it,

197
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,352
I've noticed that it hasn't
attacked us much when we're
talking to each other.

198
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:51,123
It almost seems like she's
curious about our conversation.

199
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,258
[Ichika] Yeah, I know.

200
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,662
There's no way it can
be unmanned.

201
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,165
Someone has to be inside
an IS or it won't move.

202
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,268
That's just how it is.

203
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,804
[Ichika] But think about it...

204
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:11,208
What if... What if there really
is no one in there?

205
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,709
[Rinin] Wait...

206
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,612
Are you saying we could
beat it if it's unmanned?

207
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,980
Yeah...

208
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,415
If there's no one in there,

209
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,751
we can literally pound it with
everything we've got,

210
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,419
and it would be okay.

211
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:28,089
Pound it with everything
we've got, huh?

212
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,325
Reiraku Byakuya...

213
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:33,794
That's Yukihira Nigata's
all‐out attack.

214
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:36,864
[Ichika] The full force of
Yukihira Nigata is normaly
too powerful.

215
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:41,401
So, you can't go all out with
it during training or in a
class match for that matter.

216
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:44,938
However, you could if your
opponent was unmanned.

217
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,608
[Rinin] Look, I don't know
anything about your Reiraku
thing or whatever,

218
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,210
but you can't seem to hit
a darn thing right now!

219
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:54,580
Oh, I'll hit it!

220
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,816
[sigh]
Well, you sound
pretty determined.

221
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,452
So, even though I don't think
it's a possibility,

222
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:03,288
let's just say it's unmanned
and attack the thing anyway.

223
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:07,192
All right, so the plan is that
you shoot it with the cannon at
full blast,

224
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,960
but only when I give the signal.

225
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,862
Are we both agreed on that?

226
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:13,197
Sure, but it'll miss it.

227
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,666
It'll be fine even if
it does miss.

228
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,869
[Ichika] All right, let's do
this!
[Houki] Ichika!

229
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:23,974
If you're a man...

230
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:28,243
If you're a man, you'd better
defeat the enemy completely!

231
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,048
Aw crap!

232
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,883
Houki, run!

233
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,821
Rinin, do it now!

234
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,555
You've got it!

235
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,258
Hey, you stupid idiot!

236
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:46,394
What are you doing? Get out of
my line of fire!

237
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,562
Just shoot, damnit!

238
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:52,700
You crazy jerk! Whatever
happens is not my fault!

239
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:16,787
<i>This is for Rinin, Houki,</i>
<i>Chifuyu, and everyone else</i>
<i>I care about!</i>

240
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,289
<i>I will protect all of you!</i>

241
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,795
Ichika!

242
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,397
[Houki] Ichika!

243
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,769
[Rinin] Ichika, get out!

244
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:35,471
How's your aim?

245
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,606
[Cecilia] Perfect, of course!

246
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:46,248
[Houki] Cecilia!

247
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,915
[Rinin] But when did you...

248
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,717
Cecilia, take him out!

249
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,586
Roger that, I'm on it!

250
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,697
[Cecilia] It looks like we made
it with not a second to spare!

251
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,267
I knew you'd come through
in time, Cecilia.

252
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,769
O‐Oh? Do you really mean it?

253
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,638
Still, that's to be
expected, right?

254
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:17,909
Well, it's over now. In any ca‐
[alarm]

255
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,110
[Ichika] Oh, you're kidding me!

256
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,980
Ichika, it's still moving!

257
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,557
Rinin? What were you doing
just then?

258
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,425
U‐Uh, were you awake?

259
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,130
Why are you acting so nervous?

260
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,598
What makes you say that?
I'm not nervous!

261
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:22,367
That's a completely ridiculous
thing to say!

262
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:27,139
So, what happened to the IS?

263
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,540
It got shut down.

264
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,941
Don't worry though,

265
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,509
you were the only one who was
hurt in the attack.

266
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,344
Everyone else is fine.

267
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:35,913
I see.

268
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:41,518
[Ichika] You know...

269
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:44,287
Now that I think about back when
we were in elementary school,

270
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:48,924
wasn't it an evening just like
this when we had that talk about
eating sweet and sour pork?

271
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,299
[Rinin] So, if I become a
better cook,

272
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,602
will you eat my sweet and sour
pork everyday?

273
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:08,009
So, about that promise, was it
actually about something else,
Rinin?

274
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:12,112
Because I seriously thought you
mean you were going to treat me
to free meals everyday.

275
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,082
No, it's not about something
else! It's really not!

276
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:19,186
It's just that, when you
cook for someone else,
your cooking improves.

277
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,588
[nervous laughing]

278
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,223
You know, I'd love to try your
sweet and sour pork,

279
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,393
but to be honest, it'll be hard
to top your father's cooking.

280
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,295
Man I'd love to have that again.

281
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:34,365
Well, he uh, doesn't work
there anymore.

282
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,767
[Ichika] What? Why did he stop?

283
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,838
The thing is, my parents,
they got a divorce.

284
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:44,875
That's one of the reasons why I
decided to move back to China.

285
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,148
[Ichika] Hey, Rinin...

286
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:57,453
Would you want to go hang
out sometime?

287
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:59,955
You mean, like a date?

288
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:03,191
Surprise Ichika, dear!

289
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,327
I hope you're feeling much
better now.

290
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,595
But I've come to look after you‐

291
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:10,965
[Cecilia] Uh... What is this?

292
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,335
Just what are you doing here?

293
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:18,239
Remember, we decided no one
can make a move on Ichika
until he wakes up!

294
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:19,640
And what about you, then?

295
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,642
Because from my view
of your fat ass,

296
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:24,010
it sure looks like you were
trying to get ahead of me.

297
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,112
Oh, well, the thing is...

298
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,215
Get out of here, both of you!

299
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:32,251
Don't you understand that
Ichika's my childhood friend?

300
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:33,418
Well he's mine too!

301
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,387
You're from Class
2, Miss Take‐Away!

302
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,222
Hey...

303
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,259
Where's Chifuyu?

304
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,160
Now that you ask...

305
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,028
Yeah, where do you think
she went?

306
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:47,698
She was right there with us
until just a few minutes ago.

307
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,741
So, it really was unmanned.

308
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:01,678
And it seems the core
was unregistered.

309
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,945
I see.

310
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:06,569
[Maya] There are only 467 known
IS cores in the world.

311
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:11,979
And yet somehow, this IS was
equipped with a core we know
nothing about.

312
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:14,743
How can that be?

313
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:52,976
[girl 1] A new beautiful boy has
just appeared!

314
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:54,676
[girl 2] No way!
Where is he from?

315
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:56,976
[girl 3] He's from France
and his name is Charles Dunois!

316
00:23:57,076 --> 00:24:01,543
[girl 1] He's not only good
looking, but he's nice, smart
and strong too!

317
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:04,609
[girl 2] Yeah, he seems to be
perfect in so many ways!

318
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,376
[girl 3] But it looks like he
might have some secrets.

319
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:10,443
[girl 1] The next episode:
"Boy Meets Boy"

320
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:13,276
[girl 2] Orimura and Dunois are
such dreamy boys!

321
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:15,443
And now they're both at the
IS Academy!

322
00:24:15,543 --> 00:24:18,276
[in unison] And we're so glad!
