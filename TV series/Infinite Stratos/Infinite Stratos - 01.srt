1
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,132
Ichika, now!

2
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,619
Laura, now!

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,088
Jawohl!

4
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,270
Don't worry, Ichika!
I'm right here!

5
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:12,140
Come on, give it one more try!

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,614
Rin!

7
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:20,949
Please, hurry, Ichika!

8
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,252
We can't hold on!

9
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,828
You won't get away this time!

10
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:33,994
[Ichika] <i>This is...</i>

11
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:46,875
This is way, way harder than
I expected.

12
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,749
Congratulations for making
it to this school!

13
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,553
I'm your first year sub homeroom
teacher, Miss Maya Yamada.

14
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:08,197
Uh, starting today, you are all
now students of the IS Academy.

15
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:09,965
As you know, this is a
boarding school.

16
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,734
Students are together
during and after school hours.

17
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,836
[Maya] So, I hope you'll get
along and help each other,

18
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:18,574
making the next three
years enjoyable.

19
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,711
Uh... Now, moving on to
self‐introductions?

20
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,247
Umm, let's go by numerical
order on the class roll?

21
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:26,983
[Ichika] <i>Houki...</i>

22
00:04:29,652 --> 00:04:31,688
<i>Is that how you act towards</i>
<i>your childhood friend...</i>

23
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,923
<i>you haven't seen</i>
<i>for six years?</i>

24
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,024
<i>Maybe she hates me.</i>

25
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,627
[Maya] Hello!
Ichika Orimura?!

26
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:38,961
H‐Here!

27
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,264
I do apologize for being
so loud just then,

28
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,435
but we started out with the "A"s
and now we've gotten all the way
up to the "O"s.

29
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,804
So would you introduce
yourself now?

30
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:48,872
Pretty please?

31
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,909
You really don't need to
be so apologetic.

32
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,546
Uh, Ichika Orimura.

33
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,582
Nice to meet you all.

34
00:05:03,153 --> 00:05:08,892
<i>Oh no, if I don't say something</i>
<i>else, they're going to think</i>
<i>I'm really depressing!</i>

35
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,734
That's all!

36
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,503
What? Was that bad?

37
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,008
[Ichika] Sis?!

38
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,712
[Chifuyu] You will call me
"Ms. Orimura" at school!

39
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:31,583
Oh, you're back!
Does that mean the
meeting's over already?

40
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,752
That's right, Miss Yamada.

41
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:37,355
I'm sorry about having to make
you welcome my class for me.

42
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,824
<i>What is Chifuyu doing</i>
<i>here anyway?</i>

43
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:43,228
<i>My real older sister, who</i>
<i>only comes home once or</i>
<i>twice a month,</i>

44
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,265
<i>and no one has any idea what</i>
<i>she does for living?</i>

45
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:50,169
Alright class, I'm
your homeroom teacher,
Ms. Chifuyu Orimura!

46
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,906
It is my job to train you well
enough to stand on your feet
in one year.

47
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,607
[squealing]

48
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:58,043
Lady Chifuyu! That's really
Lady Chifuyu!

49
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,346
You inspired me to come to this
school with Kita Kyushu!

50
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,248
I'd die for you!

51
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,919
I'm amazed how many nut jobs
come to this school ever year.

52
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,623
Do they put all the loonies in
my class on purpose?

53
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:14,394
[fangirl 1] Lady Chifuyu,
scold us more! Cuss us out!

54
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:15,895
[fangirl 2] Train us so we
don't misbehave!

55
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:19,064
My big sister is my
homeroom teacher?

56
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:23,736
So, have the instructions
regarding addressing your
instructor not taken yet?

57
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:25,838
[Ichika] Guh, well, Chifuyu,
I was just‐

58
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:29,042
That's Ms. Orimura, right?!

59
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:32,145
Yes, Ms. Orimura...

60
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:35,315
What? You mean Orimura is
Lady Chifuyu's younger brother?

61
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,951
[friend] I wonder, does that
has anything to do with the
fact that...

62
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:40,587
he's the only male in the world
who can control an IS?

63
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:41,988
[Chifuyu] That's enough!

64
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,757
Your syllabus for the
next six months...

65
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:46,793
begins with memorizing all data
concerning the IS!

66
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,329
After that, practical training,

67
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,332
where you'll have two weeks to
master the basic maneuvers.

68
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,500
So, have you got that?

69
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,236
Even if you don't,
say "Yes ma'am"!

70
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,038
[in unison] Yes ma'am!

71
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,675
[Ichika] <i>My sister,</i>
<i>Chifuyu Orimura,</i>

72
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:06,280
<i>was one of the first</i>
<i>generation of IS pilots</i>
<i>who represented Japan.</i>

73
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,685
<i>Then out of the blue, she</i>
<i>retired and just disappeared.</i>

74
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:12,920
<i>And now she's become</i>
<i>a teacher?!</i>

75
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,857
<i>I feel stupid for ever</i>
<i>worrying about her.</i>

76
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:21,596
Now, as I'm sure all of you
are already aware, IS actually
stands for "Infinite Stratos".

77
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:24,666
It's a multi‐form suit
originally developed in Japan.

78
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,734
[Maya] When it was first
conceived ten years ago,

79
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:29,737
it was originally designed to
be used in outer space.

80
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:32,374
However, those plans are
currently on hold.

81
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:37,379
Due to the Alaska Treaty, the
IS is also prohibited from
being used by the military.

82
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,383
Therefore, it's used solely
for competitions and
sporting events.

83
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:46,221
And our IS Academy is the only
educational institution in
the world...

84
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:49,124
established with the objective
of training IS pilots.

85
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:55,331
Students from all around the
world come to this school where
young people from a multitude of
countries get to live,

86
00:07:55,431 --> 00:08:00,536
work, and study side‐by‐side
every day as they hone and
perfect their piloting skills.

87
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:04,673
So starting today, let's all
study hard over the next
three years!

88
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,675
[in unison] Yes ma'am!

89
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,379
<i>She didn't mention that only</i>
<i>females can operate IS.</i>

90
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,183
<i>Except for one male in the</i>
<i>whole world who's able to</i>
<i>do it.</i>

91
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:15,685
<i>That's me.</i>

92
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:18,054
<i>And I have no idea why!</i>

93
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:20,824
[girl] Look, that's him!

94
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,259
He's the only guy in the world
who can use the IS!

95
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:26,162
[friend] I heard that he
operated an IS during his
entrance exam.

96
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:29,132
[student] Yeah, it was big
international news!

97
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,801
[girl] So, he did come to this
school after all.

98
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:34,238
[friend] You should go talk
to him.

99
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,372
[girl] Maybe I should.

100
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,207
[student] Hey, wait just
a minute!

101
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:40,710
<i>Will someone please, please</i>
<i>save me from this situation.</i>

102
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:45,015
Can we talk for a minute?

103
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,283
[Ichika] Eh?

104
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:50,287
So, what's up?

105
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,889
[Houki] Um...

106
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,497
Well? It's been six years now.

107
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,899
So is there something you
wanted to say?

108
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,074
Oh, that's right...

109
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,775
Uh, what's right?

110
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,513
I heard about you winning the
national kendo competition
last year. Way to go!

111
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:18,950
What?! How did you find out
about that?

112
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,119
What do you mean?
It was in the newspaper.

113
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,189
And why were you looking
at that newspaper?

114
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:26,157
Actually...

115
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,127
You know, it's been ages!

116
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:33,565
But even after six years,
I recognized you right
away, Houki!

117
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:36,735
You still have the
same hairstyle.

118
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:39,138
Yeah, you don't forget a single
thing, do you?

119
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:43,175
How could I forget about you?
You're my childhood friend.

120
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:55,722
[school bell]

121
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,556
Shoot, that's the bell.

122
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,959
What's with her?
Who's Orimura's friend?

123
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,394
Well, I guess we should head
back now.

124
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,731
Yeah, I guess we should.

125
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:14,341
Okay, does anyone have any
questions so far?

126
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:18,611
<i>This active whatever and that</i>
<i>wide‐area contraption...</i>

127
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,280
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

128
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,016
<i>Don't tell me I need to</i>
<i>memorize all this stuff!</i>

129
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:24,785
Do you have any
questions, Orimura?

130
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,854
Guh, well...

131
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:29,757
Well, if you do have any
questions, just ask me, okay?

132
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,959
I am your teacher after all.

133
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,227
Miss Yamada...

134
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,863
Yes? Don't be shy.

135
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:38,231
I don't understand
any of it!

136
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:39,900
What? Not any of it?!

137
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,338
Is there anyone else here who
doesn't understand what we've
covered so far?

138
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:50,011
Orimura, did you read the
reference manual before
school started?

139
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:53,214
Um, are you talking about
that big one?

140
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,583
[Chifuyu] That's right. Didn't
it say, "required reading"?

141
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:58,787
Yeah, but I accidentally
threw it away...

142
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,221
I'll get you a new copy then,
and I expect you...

143
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,290
to have the whole thing
memorized within a week.

144
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,826
[Ichika] What?! That big book?
Within a week?

145
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,961
What did I say?

146
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,433
[Ichika] Yes ma'am.

147
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,902
[Maya] Well then,
let's continue with class.

148
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,305
Please turn to page twelve
in your textbooks.

149
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,676
May I have a moment?

150
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:22,944
Huh?

151
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,813
What sor of a response is that?

152
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,816
You should be honored that I've
bothered speaking to you in the
first place!

153
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,453
Don't you think you
should behave in a more
appropriate manner?

154
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:34,824
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't
even know who you are, okay?

155
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,859
Ah! You don't know who I am?!

156
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,628
I'm Cecilia Alcott!

157
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,596
England's
representative contender!

158
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:41,797
The one who scored
highest on the‐

159
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:42,798
[Ichika] Hold on, hold on.

160
00:11:42,898 --> 00:11:43,933
I have a question.

161
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,401
Well, it is the
responsibility...

162
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,903
of nobles to answer quearies
from the lower classes.

163
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,507
Do go ahead!

164
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:55,044
You're representative
contender, got it.
What's that mean?

165
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,947
Ah... ah... ah...

166
00:11:58,648 --> 00:11:59,682
Ah?

167
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,584
This is unbelievable!

168
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:05,288
I can only hope that every
Japanese man is not this utterly
devoid of knowledge.

169
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:08,024
I mean, it's nothing more than
common sense, honestly!

170
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,727
Are you going to tell me what is
or don't you know either?

171
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:16,099
[Cecilia] They are the chosen
elite selected by their
countries to represent
them as IS pilots.

172
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,902
Surely you should be able
to deduce that from the
name alone?

173
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,904
Oh, when you put it that way,
it makes sense.

174
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:22,873
That's right,
I am one of the elite!

175
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,843
It's a true miracle and your
good fortune to get to be in
the same homeroom...

176
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:28,112
with someone like me!

177
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,381
Oh what an incredibly lucky
boy you are!

178
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,150
Did that get through that thick
skull of yours, hm?

179
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,953
I got it. I guess I'm lucky.

180
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:38,322
Wait, are you making fun
of me now?

181
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:40,792
Hey, you're the one who just
said how lucky I was.

182
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:43,861
[Cecilia] First of all, I'd like
to know how you manage to enter
this school...

183
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,563
with no knowledge
about anything?

184
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:48,833
I heard that you're the only
male who can control an IS,

185
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,668
but you've been such a
terrbile disappointment!

186
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,671
Yeah, well, expecting anything
from me sounds like a bad idea.

187
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:56,107
[Cecilia] Hmm, in any case,
since I'm so remarkable,

188
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,212
I can still find it in my heart
to be considerate towards
people such as yourself.

189
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:05,883
So, if you do have questions,
I wouldn't mind answering them
for you if you were to plead
with tears in your eyes.

190
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:09,521
After all, I did defeat an
instructor during the
entrance exam,

191
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,356
which means that I am an
elite amongst the‐

192
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,859
[Ichikia] Um, I defeated
an instructor too.

193
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,327
What?!

194
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,995
Maybe it wasn't
really "defeat",

195
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,397
but when the instructor
charged at me, I dodged,

196
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,600
she smashed into the wall
and kaboom!

197
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,670
[Cecilia] B‐But I heard that
I was the only one.

198
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,739
They might have meant that you
were the only female.

199
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,309
[Cecilia] Wait! Are you
telling me that you also
defeated the instructor?!

200
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,411
Hey now, just calm down, okay?

201
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,747
Calm? How can I be calm
with this insult?!

202
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,082
[school bell]

203
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,117
We will be continuing this
conversation later!

204
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,153
Do you understand?

205
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,797
[giggling]

206
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,599
If things are like this on
the first day,

207
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm worried about the future.

208
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,538
[Ichika] This must be it.

209
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,643
Woah...

210
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:04,878
[squeak]

211
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:05,945
[Houki] Is someone out there?

212
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,281
Gulp! Girl!

213
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,050
[Houki] Oh hey, you must be
my roommate.

214
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,953
I look forward to having your
company this year.

215
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,321
Sorry for meeting you like this.

216
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,924
But I just got out
of the shower.

217
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,559
My name is Houki Shinonono.

218
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,173
I‐I‐Ichika?!

219
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,010
Uh... Huh...

220
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,979
[Houki] Don't look!
[Ichika] Wah! Sorry!

221
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,082
What the hell are you
doing in here?

222
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:44,285
Well, this happens to be
my room and...

223
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:48,123
Hang on! That means you and I
are sharing the same room!

224
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,098
Close call...

225
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:03,605
Are you honestly trying
to kill me?

226
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,741
I'd have been dead if I
hadn't dodged that one!

227
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,908
Huh?

228
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,944
Look, it's Orimura.

229
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,146
Hey, this is his room.

230
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,782
[Boobs McGee] That's a good to
know, isn't it, girls?

231
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,854
Houki! Miss Houki, please let me
in right now!

232
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:19,821
This is going to be bad!

233
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,090
I mean, I apologize!

234
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,193
Please let me in!
Please, I'm begging you!

235
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:27,463
Alright then.

236
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,198
O‐Okay...

237
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:42,645
[Ichika] Um, actually I wanted
to have the bed in that corner.

238
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:46,249
[Houki] So, now it turns out
you're my roommate?

239
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,617
[Ichika] It looks that way.

240
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,452
[Houki] Just what are you up to?
[Ichika] Huh?!

241
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,488
I asked you, "What are you
up to?"

242
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:55,125
Don't you know that mixing
genders past age seven is
just wrong!

243
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,760
Sounds like pretty old
fashioned thinking to me.

244
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,898
But actually, I suppose there
could be a few issues with it.

245
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:03,300
You know, with a 15 year old guy
and girl living toget‐

246
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,003
I mean sharing the same room.

247
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:08,806
You... You... You...

248
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:09,973
Uh huh?

249
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,376
You requested this room,
didn't you?

250
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,745
You asked them to put us in
here together!

251
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:16,747
You're kidding me.

252
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,285
Okay, this is scary!

253
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:24,055
Kidding, am I?!
I'll show you kidding!

254
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,690
I get it...
I get it...

255
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,959
Scary face...

256
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,127
Really scary face!

257
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:30,161
[door opening]

258
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:32,430
[girl] Shinonono's so bold!

259
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,833
Quit wiggling, it's hard to see!

260
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,636
Shoot, it's over already.

261
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:40,404
Just when it was starting
to get good.

262
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:44,976
Ichika!

263
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,446
Uh huh? What now?

264
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,914
As long as we're sharing
the same room,

265
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:51,450
I think that...

266
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,686
you and I are going to need to
establish some ground rules.

267
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,189
[Houki] First, regarding shower
usage hours.

268
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,958
I'll use it between 7 to 8 PM.

269
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,559
And you can use it from
8 to 9.

270
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,661
Aw, but I want to use
it earlier than that.

271
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:05,564
[Houki] Are you asking me not to
shower after my club activities?

272
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:07,733
You mean activities like kendo?

273
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,902
I thought that they had showers
in the club facility for that?

274
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:12,872
[Houki] I really don't feel
relaxed unless I shower in
my own room.

275
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:17,109
And I'd like to use the toilet
in my own place rather than
using the ones at school.

276
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,480
Oh, hold on, there are no
toilets in the rooms here,
are there?

277
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,149
That's right, they only
have restrooms at the end
of each hallway.

278
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,387
You think someone would've
remembered that this place
is all girls.

279
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:28,821
Well, in worst case scenario‐

280
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:30,423
[Houki] I see you've become
quite pervert...

281
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,158
during the years I haven't
seen you.

282
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,426
I'm very disappointed.

283
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:34,694
What's that supposed to mean?!

284
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,462
You want to go in the
girl's restroom!

285
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,498
What else would you call that
besides perverted?!

286
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:41,067
Argh! I should punish you
right now!

287
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,568
Oh no, you don't!

288
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,076
The hell is this?

289
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,512
[Houki] Give it back!

290
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,747
[Ichika] Hey, wait a second!

291
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,449
Hands off you pervert!

292
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,653
It would seem that you
wear a bra now, huh?

293
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:11,698
Psst...

294
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,967
Um, hello...

295
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,936
Are you still mad at me?

296
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,771
I am not mad at you.

297
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:19,040
Then why are you still
wearing the mad face?

298
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,642
Get used to it.

299
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,211
[girl] Hey, hey, that's Lady
Chifuyu's younger brother.

300
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,747
Wow, this stuff is delicious!

301
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,616
[friend] What? So, they're both
IS pilots, huh?

302
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,918
I wonder if he's
strong like her.

303
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,520
Hey, Houki, do you think‐

304
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,922
Don't use my first name!

305
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:39,161
Miss Shinonono...

306
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,496
[bold girl] Orimura, may we sit
next to you?

307
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:44,332
Huh? Sure, go ahead and
have a seat.

308
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:45,901
[in unison] Oh yeah!

309
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,003
[friend] Aw man! We should have
gone and asked him earlier!

310
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:51,539
Relax. This is only the second
day; there's no need to rush it.

311
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,111
[Nohohon] Wow, Orimura, you sure
do eat a lot for breakfast.
[Tanimoto] Such a typical boy!

312
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:59,482
Actually, I was wondering if
that's all you three are
eating for breakfast.

313
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,149
It doesn't seem like enough.

314
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:04,186
Uh, well, sure we're,
you know...

315
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,422
Yeah, I think we'll be
okay, thanks.

316
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,524
Because we eat a lot of snacks!

317
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,959
I think I'll excuse myself now.

318
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,296
Okay then, I'll see you later.

319
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,566
So, you and Shinonono must
be really close friends.

320
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,704
I heard that you two are
even sharing the same room.

321
00:19:20,804 --> 00:19:22,639
Well, we are childhood friends.

322
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,575
[in unison] Huh?!
You're childhood friends?

323
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:30,747
Yeah, we started going to the
same kendo dojo back when we
were in the first grade.

324
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,483
We were in class together
until fourth grade.

325
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,888
But I don't remember much
about it anymore...

326
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:40,657
About the past...

327
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,161
Less talking and more chewing!

328
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,730
Pilots have to eat quickly
and efficiently!

329
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,733
I'm the freshman
dorm supervisor!

330
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,770
Anyone late to class will do
ten laps around the school!

331
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:54,805
<i>Now I get it...</i>

332
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:57,608
<i>No wonder she hardly ever</i>
<i>came home.</i>

333
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:00,578
Two weeks from today,

334
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:02,279
you'll be asked to choose
your representative...

335
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,048
for the class tournament.

336
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:07,151
A class representative not only
competes in the tournament,

337
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,954
but will also attend student
council meetings and
committee meetings.

338
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:13,291
Essentially it's your class
leader, okay?

339
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:15,093
I will now take nominations.

340
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,361
Any suggestions?

341
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,763
[classmate] I'd like to
nominate Orimura!

342
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,631
[girl] Dude, I think that's a
good idea too!

343
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,001
[Ichika] Huh?! You do?!

344
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,569
So, is there anyone else?

345
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:27,105
If not, he'll be elected
without a vote.

346
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,539
[Ichika] Hang on a minute!

347
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,075
What if I don't want to‐

348
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,043
[Cecilia] I don't approve
of this!

349
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,713
This type of selection is
utterly unacceptable!

350
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:37,683
It would be shameful to have a
boy as our class representative!

351
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:43,789
You can't possibly expect that
I, Cecilia Alcott, should have
to deal with that sort of
humiliation for an entire year?

352
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:49,161
In the first place, simply
living in a country with such an
underdeveloped level of culture
is unbearably painful...

353
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,063
to someone like myself!
Oh, the agony!

354
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:53,966
Well your country doesn't have
that many things to brag
about either.

355
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,336
How often has England won the
world's worst cuisine award?

356
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:59,338
We English have many
delicious dishes!

357
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:03,676
I can't believe you would have
the audacity to insult
my country!

358
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,117
This calls for a duel!

359
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:12,151
[Ichika] Fine by me!

360
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,486
It'll be easier than debating!

361
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,322
And if you should ever lose
to me on purpose,

362
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:17,056
I promise to make you
my servant!

363
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,658
No, I shall make you my slave!

364
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:20,493
[Ichika] How much handicap
will there be?

365
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,130
Eh? Are you asking me
for a favor already?

366
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,866
[Ichika] No, I was wondering how
much of a handicap I should
give you.

367
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:27,935
[giggling]

368
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,838
[classmate] Orimura, are you
being serious?

369
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,873
Yeah, men used to be stronger
than women,

370
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:35,943
but that was before IS
was invented!

371
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:38,612
[girl] People say if men and
women were to have a war,

372
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:40,614
it wouldn't even last
three days.

373
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,916
<i>Damn, that's right...</i>

374
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:45,486
As a matter of fact, I'm the one
who should be wondering...

375
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:47,588
about giving you a handicap.

376
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:50,524
Japanese boys are so humorous,
aren't they?

377
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:54,862
[classmate] Hey, if you're nice,
a real lady might still give you
that handicap, you know.

378
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:57,631
And a real man never goes
back on his word!

379
00:21:58,332 --> 00:21:59,300
I'll pass.

380
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,536
Um, you're underestimating her!

381
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,406
It looks like that's
settled then.

382
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:10,011
The competition will be staged
in Arena 3, which I believe is
available Monday.

383
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:14,009
[Chifuyu] Orimura and Alcott,
I expect you to come fully
prepared for combat.

384
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:53,076
[Maeda] At last, Infinite
Stratos has finally begun!

385
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:56,242
[Iwayama] And now there's a duel
with the British girl and her
personal IS!

386
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:58,142
Do you think Orimura will
be alright?

387
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:01,809
[Kagose] If he loses, I think
the entire class should cheer
him up together!

388
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,109
[Maeda] Wait, it looks like
Orimura has some secret
strategies too.

389
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:07,876
[Iwaya] I heard that Lady
Chifuyu has something
awesome for him.

390
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,542
[Kagose] Alright! I'm so
looking forward to it!

391
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:14,376
[Maeda] Next episode:
"Class Rep Selection Match!"

392
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:17,976
[in unison] Hooray,
hooray, Orimura!
