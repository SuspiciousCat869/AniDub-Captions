1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:03,668
[Houki] But don't worry, okay?

2
00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:07,171
You can always trust me to get
you where you're going.

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,340
[Ichika] I have to try!

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,242
[Houki] I'm finished as a pilot.
I quit.

5
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:18,412
[Rinen] So are you going to get
up or are you just a pathetic
coward, who can't fight when it
really counts for something?

6
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:20,714
[Houki] Because I'm not
going to lose this time!

7
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,355
Don't hold back! Keep firing!

8
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,258
[Laura] It's faster than
I expected.

9
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,307
I've got him!

10
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:01,653
At this rate, we'll never shoot
him down!

11
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,714
[Ichika] Why does this...

12
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:47,316
remind me of something I've
seen before?

13
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,079
They're calling.

14
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,180
You have to go now.

15
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:00,664
Did you get it?

16
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,566
No! Not yet!

17
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,255
[Armored Girl] Ichika, do you
desire power?

18
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,799
[Laura] Houki, release your
weapons and run!

19
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,833
Houki!

20
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:54,834
Houki!

21
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,446
Are you all right?

22
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:16,548
Yes I am. I'm just fine.

23
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:23,453
Ichika, do you desire power?

24
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,407
Mien Got! It's shifted
into Secondary form!

25
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:07,548
Ichika, do you desire power?

26
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,686
Why do you desire power?

27
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,489
Uh...

28
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,825
I want to... protect
my friends...

29
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:25,294
I mean, my comrades, that's
what I want.

30
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,695
For your comrades?

31
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,463
[Ichika] Yes, it's like,

32
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:34,533
there's so much in this world
that you have to fight against.

33
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:38,235
Do you understand what
I'm saying?

34
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,871
This world is consumed with
irrational violence.

35
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:46,974
I want to fight it and to aid my
comrades in that battle as
much as I can...

36
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,576
That's what I need the power
for, to help them.

37
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,979
Yes, I see.

38
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,815
It's your fate, you have to go.

39
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,351
[Girl] Do you understand?

40
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,320
[Ichika] Uh‐huh.

41
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:18,995
Houki! No!

42
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:52,384
[Houki] I miss you...

43
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,754
I miss you, Ichika.

44
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:01,657
I miss you.

45
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,492
I miss you.

46
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:09,362
Ichika...

47
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,999
[Ichika] Houki...

48
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,672
Ichika?

49
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,941
Yeah, I'm sorry about the wait.

50
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,476
Ichika!

51
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,843
But your wounds!

52
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:32,043
Are you?

53
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:33,178
Oh I'm okay.

54
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,745
I can fight too.

55
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:37,547
Everyone tried to stop
me though.

56
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:39,648
I'm...

57
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:42,717
I'm so glad...that
you're alright.

58
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:46,020
[Ichika] Hang on, are
you crying?

59
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,122
No, of course I'm not crying!

60
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,424
Well just in case, here.

61
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,827
To be honest I like your normal
hairdo better than this.

62
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:59,496
[Ichika] But um, Happy birthday.
By the way.

63
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:02,864
Today is July 7th, isn't it?

64
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,968
I'll be back, just have faith.

65
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,507
Oh Ichika...

66
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:23,444
Why haven't are transmissions
gone back to normal yet?!

67
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:27,014
Because, the kids probably shut
it off themselves.

68
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,014
[Tanimoto] Ms. Orimura!

69
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:28,948
[Nohohon and Kanarin] Ma'am!

70
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:29,949
Just stay out!

71
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:30,982
We're busy in here!

72
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:32,818
We understand that, ma'am...

73
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,485
But Orimura is...

74
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,487
[Nohohon starts crying]
[Chifuyu] What?

75
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,962
That's the Byakushiki's second
form: Setsura!

76
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:56,166
Setsura, change to Shield Mode!

77
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,470
That's the Reiraku
Byakuya shield?

78
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:06,840
Houki!

79
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,540
I'm okay.

80
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,175
Don't worry about me!

81
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:16,346
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,648
It took some time to recover.

83
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:22,150
Right, then it's time to stage
our counterattack!

84
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,184
Laura! Cecilia!

85
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,520
Alright Ichika, let's finish
this up in short order.

86
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,355
We have enough energy for this.

87
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,556
[Charolette] So you don't worry
about us.

88
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,691
[Ichika] Rin! Charl!

89
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,593
Come on! Let's do it!

90
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,862
Ichika...

91
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:45,165
<i>I want to fight along side you.</i>

92
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:47,467
<i>I want to have your back.</i>

93
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:54,504
What's going on?

94
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,506
My energy's recharging!

95
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,308
This is the Kenran Buto...

96
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:05,078
So this has to be the
Akatsubaki's fourth gen's
special ability.

97
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,182
Right...

98
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:13,617
Let's do this, Akatsubaki!

99
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,156
The Byakushiki has fallen to
just ten percent.

100
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,564
Oh, no! My energy level!

101
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,570
Ichika, here take this!

102
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,477
[Ichika] What the hell? My
energy's been recharged!

103
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:57,313
That's right! Now go and finish
it off!

104
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:58,747
[Ichika] Right!

105
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:00,481
[Ichika] Let's go!

106
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,616
[Houki] Right!

107
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:02,449
[Laura] Yeah!
[Rinen] Let's do it!

108
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,683
[Cecilia] Roger!

109
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,730
Ichika, now!

110
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,077
Laura, now!

111
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,311
Jawohl!

112
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:00,655
I'm right over here you monster!

113
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,290
Ichika, hit it one more time!

114
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:12,128
Rin!

115
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,229
Please hurry Ichika!

116
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,330
We can't hold on!

117
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,203
You won't get away this time!

118
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:05,764
Is it over?

119
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah, it finally is.

120
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:17,605
[Chifuyu] Mission accomplished!

121
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,340
Well that's what I'd like
to say.

122
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,275
But the fact is you've committed
a grave offense here.

123
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,076
[Everyone] Yes, ma'am!

124
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:26,945
When you get home, I want you to
all write an essay on what you
did wrong.

125
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:30,647
And in the mean time I'll be
preparing some especialy
grueling training for you
as punishment.

126
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,349
Uh excuse me, Miss Orimura?

127
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,818
But shouldn't we call it a
day now?

128
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:39,786
[Yamada] I'm sure everyone is
very tired.

129
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:47,691
[Chifuyu] But inspite of
all the screw ups, you did a
good job.

130
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:52,294
And...I'm glad you all made it
back alright.

131
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:55,363
[Chifuyu] So um, take the rest
of the day off.

132
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:57,932
So um, like hey...

133
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,399
And just what happened
out there?

134
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,068
What really made the Gospel
run wild?

135
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,469
Is it true there was no one
inside it?

136
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:08,272
Weren't you afraid when you
were fighting? Wasn't it scary?

137
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,540
Come on you guys, tell us.

138
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,042
The teachers aren't saying
anything to anybody.

139
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:14,209
So sorry.

140
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,845
The officals labeled the whole
thing top secret.

141
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:21,113
No kidding, even we haven't been
told all the particulars yet.

142
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,482
I understand you're curious
about the situation,

143
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:28,052
but if you knew more they would
place restrictions on you
as well. Okay?

144
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:31,087
Uh, no, I don't think I'd
like that.

145
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:33,989
I wouldn't wanna be spied on
or anything.

146
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,092
Hold on, just where have Ichika
and Houki wandered off to?

147
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,337
[Tabane] The Byakushiki sure is
surprising. Isn't it?

148
00:16:57,437 --> 00:17:01,407
It even has the capability
of being able to revive
its pilot.

149
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:02,575
Just like...

150
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:05,242
[Chifuyu] Just like
the Shirokishi?

151
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:10,346
Core number 001, which you
poured your blood, sweat and
tears into,

152
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,781
the orginal I. S. Unit.

153
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:16,150
What's up, Chii‐chan?

154
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,586
[Chifuyu] I'd like to speak
hypothetically.

155
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,953
Let's say that a certain genius

156
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:28,625
could have an I. S. planted at a
certain location on the day of a
certain boy's high‐school
entrance exam.

157
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:33,761
The genius makes sure that's
the only time this I.S.
ever moves.

158
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:39,332
That way, it would look like a
boy, who can't operater an I. S.,
actually made it move.

159
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:46,370
Then, that would have been
the only time it moved,
wouldn't it?

160
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,340
[Tabane] But to be honest with
you, even I don't know exactly
why the Byakushiki moves.

161
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,074
It's really a mystery.

162
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:55,776
[Chifuyu] Alright then.

163
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,944
Let's talk about
something different.

164
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:04,281
A certain genius decides she
wants to debut her precious
younger sister with a big bang.

165
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:08,651
So for her sister, she prepares
her own personal unit,

166
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,653
and another I. S. that may just
run amuck.

167
00:18:11,753 --> 00:18:13,888
And then when an
incident occurs,

168
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:17,957
she drops her sister's new
state of the art unit into
the mix.

169
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:20,992
Quite a debut for little sis,
don't you think?

170
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:24,028
[Tabane] That really would be a
super genius, huh?

171
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,664
Mhm, a true super genius,

172
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:34,035
a super genius who's already
managed to hack into the
military computers of at
least twenty countries.

173
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,938
[Tabane] Say, Chii‐chan...

174
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,906
I wonder, does the world seem
like a fun place to you?

175
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:45,242
[Chifuyu] Fun? More or less
I suppose.

176
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:46,409
[Tabane] I agree.

177
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:09,859
<i>I finally did it, I protected</i>
<i>my comrades.</i>

178
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,526
[Houki] Ichika?

179
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:14,061
Hey Houki.

180
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,796
So you came down here to
swim too?

181
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:19,998
Uh‐huh, that and I wanted to
clear my head a bit.

182
00:19:20,098 --> 00:19:23,468
So, um, I guess you had the
same idea.

183
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:32,874
Uh...I really wish you
wouldn't stare.

184
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,141
Oh, I'm sorry.

185
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,246
[Ichika] So um...I
was wondering.

186
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,615
[Houki] Uh, yeah?

187
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,949
[Ichika] Is your hair okay?

188
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:48,985
It got kinda burned back
there, right?

189
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:51,152
[Houki] Yeah, oh it's no
big deal.

190
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:54,321
It'll grow back and as for
the ribbon...

191
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:58,056
Well, I got a new one.

192
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,326
I'm really glad it'll be
fine then.

193
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:06,529
And that everyone got back okay.
Even my injuries were nothing
major in the end.

194
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:09,064
But are you really okay?

195
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:14,634
I mean, I didn't think you'd be
able to recover from something
like that so easily.

196
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,236
Well it wasn't nearly as bad as
it looked.

197
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:20,238
So there's no need for you
to worry about it anymore, okay?

198
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,072
But, I do!

199
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:25,575
I do! It's my fault that you
were injured in the first place!

200
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:28,877
If you has made just one wrong
move, you might have
been killed!

201
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,278
So you're wrong...

202
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:35,281
don't forgive me like it's not a
big deal.

203
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,285
[Ichika] Okay if you feel like
that, how about some punishment?

204
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:42,453
[Houki] Punishment?

205
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:43,821
[Ichika] Yes, punishment.

206
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,922
Now close your eyes.

207
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,891
[Houki] That's fine, I
deserve it.

208
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,228
[Ichika] Okay, all done.

209
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,295
[Houki] Are you making fun
of me?

210
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:59,264
[Ichika] Hey calm down, don't
get so excited.

211
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:00,732
Don't get excited?!

212
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,267
How can a warrior be calm
when her pride has
just been sullied?!

213
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,401
[Ichika] Houki, THEY'RE
touching me!

214
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,037
Okay, now they're not.

215
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:12,540
But um, can I ask you how
they compair?

216
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
What?

217
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,175
[Houki] Look! This is what I'm
talking about.

218
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,580
I'm asking if you've noticed me
as someone of the opposite sex.

219
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,616
Uh, I suppose.

220
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,015
Is that so?

221
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,714
We noticed that the two of you
had disappeared.

222
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:49,147
That's right! What were you
doing here on the beach?

223
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:51,314
Yeah, let's kill him.

224
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:54,547
Well maybe a flesh wound!

225
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,781
Houki, time to leave!

226
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:02,047
[Charolette] Zut alors!
Stop dodging!

227
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:03,214
[Laura] You can't escape!

228
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,314
[Rinen] You're dead!

229
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:05,847
Stop running, Ichika!

230
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:08,314
[Charolette] We were worried
something had happened to you!

231
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,814
[Ichika] Please! Forgive me!
[Cecilia] You'll be sorry you
were transfered to this
school at all!

232
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,581
[Laura] You are ill‐prepared to
be my bride!

233
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,747
[Ichika screams]
