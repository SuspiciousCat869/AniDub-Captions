1
00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:05,708
[Chifuyu] What? Didn't expect
your lewd fifteen‐year‐old
desires to be expressed to
your teacher?

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:09,111
[Tabane] I have an even better
plan that's in my head, and now
it's printing!

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,446
[Chifuyu] I'm afraid there's
something I'll be needing all
of you for.

4
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:16,116
[Houki] My own personal I. S. At
last, you're finally mine.

5
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,077
Now, Byakushiki!

6
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,351
Here we go, Akatsubaki!

7
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,502
Okay, Houki, It's on.

8
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:59,171
You know I'd have never let a
man go before me, before this.

9
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,807
But I think I can make a special
excemption this time.

10
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:05,443
Especialy since we're
alone together.

11
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,684
[Ichika] Listen, Houki...

12
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:17,752
This isn't a practice match.

13
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,086
So we need to be really
extra careful about how...

14
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:21,755
You're not telling me anything I
don't know.

15
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,223
But don't worry, okay?

16
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:27,092
You can always trust me to get
you where you're going.

17
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,628
So just rest easy and let me do
the driving.

18
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:33,130
You seem to be really getting
into this.

19
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,766
Did a new attitude come
with the personal unit?

20
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,301
Oh I'm just the same as always.

21
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:44,072
But you know, you need to
remember to stay calm out there.

22
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,240
I know that.

23
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,376
[Chifuyu] Orimura, Shinonono,
do you read me?

24
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,377
Yes ma'am.

25
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,278
We read you loud and clear.

26
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,247
The success of this whole
mission is dependent on a
one‐shot kill.

27
00:03:56,347 --> 00:04:00,450
So get in there and finish it
off as quickly as you can.

28
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,119
Your target the rouge
I. S. unit:

29
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,354
will be referred to simply as
the Gospel. Is that clear?

30
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,123
[Ichika] Yes ma'am!
[Houki] Understood!

31
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:14,361
Um, Miss Orimura, should I
continue to provide Ichika
with tactical support as
the situation calls for it?

32
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:18,098
If it calls for it, yes. But
don't push yourself too hard.

33
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:21,033
Remember, you have no battle
experience in the Akatsubaki.

34
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,769
[Chifuyu] It's a prototype
unit and an unforeseen problem
could suddenly arise.

35
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:30,640
Understood, ma'am. But I'll do
what I can, to the best of
my ability.

36
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,575
Does Houki sound a
little strange?

37
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:37,012
Yes, she sounded that way to
me too.

38
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,814
I can understand, but...

39
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,250
Open a private channel
to Orimura.

40
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,152
Right.

41
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,720
Ichika.

42
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,287
Y..Yes!

43
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:52,023
[Chifuyu] The reason I'm using
a private channel is so that,

44
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,492
Shinonono can't overhear our
conversation, so play dumb.

45
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,595
I think she's getting a little
carried away.

46
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:05,133
She's overly excited, and in
that fram of mind she could
make a fatal mistake.

47
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:07,535
Should anything happen,
lend her your support.

48
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,670
[Ichika] I'll keep that in mind.
You can count on me ma'am

49
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,239
Very well.

50
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,474
Switching to an
open channel.

51
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,575
Standing by.

52
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,345
Commence the operation.

53
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,382
Ready?

54
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,283
Always!

55
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:37,623
<i>Where is all this speed</i>
<i>coming from?!</i>

56
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:40,525
<i>The Akatsubaki is amazing!</i>

57
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,500
The Ignition Boost cannot
even compair to this!

58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,935
Such astonishing speed...

59
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,979
[Houki] Establishing temporary
satellite link.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,047
Information collation complete.

61
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,749
The target's current location
has been confirmed.

62
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,850
Ichika, are you ready to go in?

63
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,952
Yeah! Ready.

64
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:24,859
Ichika, I see it!

65
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,628
Yeah, that's the Silvario
Gospel alright.

66
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,096
I'm increasing speed.

67
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,898
Just ten seconds till we make
contact with the target.

68
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,413
Keep going! Don't slow
down, Houki!

69
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,551
It dodged it?!

70
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:13,595
Houki listen, let's try hitting
it from the left and right
at once.

71
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,263
I'll take right, you take left.

72
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,165
Understood!

73
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:32,509
Ichika, I'm going to try and cut
off its movements!

74
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,411
Got it!

75
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:46,887
Ichika, engage now!

76
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,321
Roger!

77
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,160
Ichika!

78
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,167
[Houki] What the hell are
you doing?!

79
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,069
You just blew our chance!

80
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,235
Our intelegence
was wrong,

81
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,037
the teachers didn't scan
the water,

82
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:10,472
there's a ship down there!

83
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,706
A ship?!

84
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,708
[Ichika] It looks like a
poaching vessel.

85
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:15,842
Are you nuts?

86
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,311
There's no time for that now!

87
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,712
They're just criminals.

88
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,081
Forget about them!

89
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,983
No I can't turn my back on them!

90
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:38,626
Idiot! You'd put protecting them
ahead of this?!

91
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,827
You need to get out of here!

92
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,129
Houki!

93
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:48,233
[Ichika] Please Houki, don't
talk like that...

94
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,202
That's not the Houki I know.

95
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,004
Don't you remember?

96
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:56,139
With great power comes
great responcibility.

97
00:08:56,239 --> 00:09:00,209
That makes protecting people
like them our job.

98
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,244
You can' turn a blind eye
towards them.

99
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:08,615
That's really not like you
at all.

100
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,917
But I was just...

101
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,086
I...I was...

102
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,563
<i>So is it out of energy as well?</i>

103
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,235
<i>I have to try!</i>

104
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,439
Ichika!

105
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,076
NO!

106
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,705
[Yamada] It looks like it
stopped now.

107
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:30,410
Do you suppose weadquarters
will still want us to continue
with the operation, ma'am?

108
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,879
Until we receieve the order to
stand down, we have no choice.

109
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,013
But how?

110
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:37,448
And with what means ma'am?

111
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,017
[Charl] Excuse me.

112
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,018
Who is it?

113
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,719
[Charl] It's Dunois.

114
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,788
You're on standby!

115
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:47,255
You're not allowed to enter!

116
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,394
We have to obey the order of
our superior.

117
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:57,730
But...I am certain that she is
as worried about Ichika as
we are.

118
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,599
She's his sister!

119
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,667
And he still hasn't regained
conciousness yet.

120
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:08,238
She did order Ichika's treatment
but she still hasn't gone over
to check up on him...

121
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:35,826
Alright, what should we do?

122
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:39,328
Well Ms. Orimora hasn't gone to
speak Houki yet either.

123
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:44,632
I understand that the mission
was a failure, but isn't that
being rather insensitive
towards her?

124
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,635
Right now, she is concentrating
on tracking the Gospel.

125
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:51,471
The instucter is simply doing
what she knows must be done.

126
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,908
However it must be difficult for
her too.

127
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,945
That's the reason she has
locked herself into the
operation center.

128
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,612
She is worried about him,

129
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:06,882
but would visiting Ichika do
anything to help destroy
the Gospel?

130
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:14,655
A much more pressing
problem is...

131
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,148
[Chifuyu] This mission was a
complete failure!

132
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:55,151
If there are any changes to the
situation, I will convene
a meeting.

133
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:59,254
And until I do, consider
yourselves all on standby!

134
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,195
I...

135
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,199
[Ichika] No! I can't turn my
back on them!

136
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,601
Idiot! You'd put protecting them
ahead of this?

137
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:19,637
Don't talk like that. That's not
the Houki I know.

138
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:21,705
You can't turn a blind eye
towards them.

139
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:25,341
Remember with great power comes
great responcibility.

140
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,377
No! That's not it!

141
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,814
I haven't become blind.

142
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:35,616
You say that those guys
are simply "weak"?

143
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,618
And that they need to
be protected?

144
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,620
They break the law and
hurt others.

145
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,256
How is it you're able to
forgive them?

146
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:51,127
Is that your strength?
It is isn't it?

147
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:53,562
That's what makes you
so different.

148
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,999
And compared to you, I'm...

149
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:10,808
All this time I've
talked of strength,

150
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:15,479
but have I just been using that
to vent my inner rage?

151
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:26,920
In your eyes, that poaching
vessel and I deserved to be
protected equally.

152
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:31,991
But I...

153
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,461
[knock on the door]

154
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,865
[Yamada] Shinonono...

155
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,934
You really ought to get some
rest as well, you know.

156
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:49,871
It wont help anything if you
push yourself too hard and get
sick because,

157
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,306
everyone will worry about you.

158
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:56,009
[Houki] But I want to be here.

159
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,477
[Yamada] That won't do.

160
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,211
Please go get some rest now.

161
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:02,581
That was a direct order from
Miss Orimura.

162
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:03,615
Understood?

163
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,517
Miss Shinonono...

164
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:12,955
[Houki] Understood.

165
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:21,073
[Bully 1] Hey, tomboy, how come
you don't have your wooden sword
with you today, huh?

166
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,175
[Young Ichika] Shut up you guys!

167
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,310
You loud mouths need to quit
goofing off!

168
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,979
Help out or go home! Okay?

169
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,480
What's the deal, Orimura?

170
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,982
[Bully 2] You mean you like
this tomboy?

171
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,616
[Bully 3] Yeah! Don't you know?

172
00:16:34,716 --> 00:16:35,817
They're, like, married.

173
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:36,684
[Bully 1] I know!

174
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,085
Hey I'll bet you guys have been

175
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,320
all lovey‐dovey with eachother
since this morning.

176
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,790
Haven't you Orimura? OoooOou.

177
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,891
That's right!

178
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,225
The other day, she had a
friggin' ribbon on,

179
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,362
how dumb a tomboy
wearing a ribbon.

180
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,629
What a laugh. Ha!

181
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,707
[Young Houki] You're an idiot,
aren't you?

182
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,242
[Young Ichika] Huh? Why would
you say that?

183
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:14,913
[Young Houki] Don't you under‐
stand that doing something like
that will cause you problems
later on?

184
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:16,547
[Young Ichika] I don't think
about it.

185
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,650
I just smack down bad guys.

186
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,752
Look, don't worry about
those losers.

187
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:25,788
That ribbon you were wearing
looked good on you.

188
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,556
I think you should wear
it again.

189
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:31,926
Well forget it! I'm not ever
taking any orders from anyone!

190
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,094
[Young Ichika] Well, I
better be going.

191
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,962
See you, Shinonono.

192
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,863
[Young Houki] Hey Wait!

193
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:40,365
Just so you know,
my name is Houki.

194
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,100
Remember that!.

195
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:45,603
Because here at this dojo, my
mom, dad and my sister,

196
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:49,339
are all Shinonono,
and it's confusing.

197
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:51,240
So just call be by my
first name.

198
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,508
If you wanna.

199
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:54,075
[Young Ichika] Well okay:
Ichika.

200
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,077
[Young Houkia] Uh what?

201
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,745
Oh, that's my name.

202
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,581
There's another Orimura too,
so you just call me
Ichika. Alright?

203
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:40,978
[Rinen] There you are!

204
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:45,181
Pathetic. You're so predictable.

205
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,383
Running off, assuming what
happend was your fault.

206
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,752
That's what you've been thinking
isn't it?

207
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,823
So, enjoying your little self
pity party for one?

208
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:00,092
Well too bad! Cause it's over!

209
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:03,795
[Rinen] Now listen here! You've
got a job to do and we need you!

210
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,597
So stop sulking and get back
to work!

211
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,771
I'm finished as a pilot...

212
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:17,738
I quite.

213
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,878
Stop being such a spoiled brat!

214
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:28,113
We don't have time for you to
play these games!

215
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:31,716
Not when you just got your own
custom made personal I. S.

216
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:37,753
So are you going to get up or
are you just a pathetic coward,
who can't fight when it really
counts for something?

217
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,824
[Houki] What else should I do?

218
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:45,759
It's not like we know where the
enemy is!

219
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,596
But when the time comes I swear
that I will fight!

220
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,132
Okay she's got her fire
back now.

221
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,169
[Rinen] Told ya! It takes a pain
in the ass to handle one.

222
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:05,841
What's going on?

223
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,743
All of us feel the same way
about this.

224
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:12,213
We can't let this end with us
losing, can we?

225
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,753
[Rinen] Laura, have your friends
found the Gospel?

226
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,855
[Laura] I have the confirmation.

227
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:33,629
The target has been confirmed
30 kilometers from here, in the
air and also offshore.

228
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:38,966
The unit is currently in
stealth mode, but it does
not seem to have any kind
of optical camouflage.

229
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,835
We were able to locate its
position via satellite.

230
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,270
That's the German Army's
Special Forces for you!

231
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,438
Those girls kick ass.

232
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,640
And what is everyone
else's status?

233
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,574
Are the rest you ready to
do this?

234
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:54,411
Of course. The Shenlong's
offensive specialization
package has been installed.

235
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:56,812
And I'm ready to keep the
British end up.

236
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,114
Preparations are complete on
my end.

237
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,215
I can go anytime.

238
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:01,383
Wait a minute.

239
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,217
What do you mean by "Go"?

240
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:05,119
Isn't that against
direct orders?

241
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,554
So what?

242
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:09,289
You just said you'd fight when
the time came, right?

243
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:11,558
Yeah, what will you do?

244
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,160
I...

245
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,261
I will...

246
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:19,263
fight.

247
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:20,898
I'll fight and win!

248
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:23,500
Because I'm not going to lose
this time!

249
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,836
That's right, and this time,
we're going to nail that thing
for sure!

250
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,326
First shot is a hit!

251
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,197
Ma'am, that was...

252
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,289
I saw...

253
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:06,689
But that's against orders!

254
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,135
We have to call them back!

255
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:12,284
[Chifuyu] I always suspected I
it would come to this in
the end.

256
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:53,873
[Cecilia] At last the final
battle is now at hand.

257
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,373
And I can hardly wait!

258
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:58,307
[Rinen] It got us good last
time, but the counterattack
has begun!

259
00:23:58,407 --> 00:23:59,840
This time we'll avenge Ichika!

260
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,007
[Charl] And we cannot drop our
guard for a moment.

261
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,107
We still do not know the full
extent of the enemy's power.

262
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:08,307
[Laura] But we must put a stop
to this, no matter what takes.

263
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,640
Let us show it how strong
we are!

264
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,340
The next episode, "Your Name Is"

265
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,673
Ichika, please allow me to
protect you this time.
