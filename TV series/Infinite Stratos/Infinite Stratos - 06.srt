1
00:00:01,238 --> 00:00:04,595
[Maya] I'm about to introduce
another new addition to our
expanding classroom.

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,287
[Charles] It's nice to
meet you, Ichika.

3
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:08,255
You can call me Charles
if you like.

4
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:10,256
[Houki] You have to date me!

5
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,757
[Laura] I do not approve.

6
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:16,526
In fact, I will never approve
that you're her brother!

7
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,791
[girls] 1, 2, 1, 2...

8
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:02,327
What I'm trying to say is you
have to do it like "whoosh",

9
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,361
and then "clang",
and then "bang", and then‐

10
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:06,363
You understand what she's
getting at, right?

11
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,397
It's all about your feelings.

12
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:11,033
Huh? Why don't you understand,
you moron?

13
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:14,401
For defense, tilt your
right side forward at
a five‐degree angle.

14
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,302
When you maneuver around,
tilt your body backward at
a twenty‐degree angle.

15
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,071
[girls talking over each other]
[Ichika] Let me be honest with
all of you...

16
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:23,073
[Ichika] I don't get this!
[Houki] Why don't you get it?

17
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:25,642
[Rinin] Yeah, just pay attention
like you're supposed to!

18
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:27,443
[Cecilia] I'll explain it to you
one more time!

19
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,710
You tilt your body forward
five‐degrees and‐

20
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,379
[Charles] All right, Ichika!
I'm here as promised.

21
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,447
I hope you're ready for a match.

22
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,949
Ready to compare your
IS with mine?

23
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,916
Hey, Charles! Sure!

24
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,918
So, I guess I'll see you
guys later, all right?

25
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:47,355
[girl 1] Check it out! It looks
like Orimura and Dunois are
going to fight.

26
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:51,958
[girl 2] Wow!
[girl 3] Dunois's personal
machine is called Rafale
Revive, right?

27
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:55,594
[girl 4] It's a
second‐generation
type IS from France.

28
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,228
Here we go, Ichika!

29
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:58,863
Yeah! Come on!

30
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:14,238
[girls in awe]

31
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,740
Ichika!

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,108
Bring it!

33
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:41,355
[Charles] Basically,
the reason you cannot win...

34
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:47,126
is becase you have very little
understanding of the shooting
weapons' characteristics.

35
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,194
[Ichika] And since all I have to
go on is theories,

36
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:50,295
I'm screwed.

37
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:51,596
That's right, the Byakushiki...

38
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,230
doesn't have an equalizer,
does it?

39
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,399
Ah, something about there not
being a vacant bus slot?

40
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,000
It's only speculation,

41
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,002
but I would think it's using the
space for its one‐off ability.

42
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,269
The one‐off what?

43
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,104
The ability that
naturally emerges...

44
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:09,040
when the IS and its pilot are
in their best condition
at the same time.

45
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,909
[Charles] For the Byakushiki,
your Reiraku Byakuya may be it.

46
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,276
Ah ha...

47
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:17,178
Wow, you explain everything
very simply, don't you?

48
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:20,747
[Houki] Hmph! And you don't even
listen to any of my advice!

49
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,449
[Rinin] And after I tried
to teach you so kindly too!

50
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:26,918
[Cecilia] And what was wrong
with my very articulate
explanations?

51
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:30,386
[Ichika] The thing is,
the Reiraku Byakuya is
an insane attack...

52
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,588
that even consumes
the unit's shield energy.

53
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:37,325
It's the same ability that Miss
Orimura's IS was using,
n'est‐ce pas?

54
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:40,159
You are not supposed to be able
to employ the same technique...

55
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,828
merely because the two of you
are siblings...

56
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,397
[Charles] D'accord,
let's try it again, shall we?

57
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:51,066
[Ichika] Hold on, I thought
I couldn't use someone
else's equipment.

58
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,567
[Charles] Normally, no.

59
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,301
However, if the user unlocks it,

60
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,971
anyone can use it as long
as that person is a
registered user.

61
00:04:58,371 --> 00:04:59,705
Oh.

62
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,208
[Ichika] Am I using the
right stance?

63
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:05,375
[Charles] Let's see...

64
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,276
Keep your arms close
to your side,

65
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,578
and your left arm goes here.

66
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,246
Easy, no?

67
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,680
Yeah...

68
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,782
[Rinin] Hey,
doesn't it seem like...

69
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,084
those two are getting along just
a little too well?

70
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,918
[crash]

71
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,187
[crash]

72
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:27,056
[crash, crash, crash]

73
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:30,858
Woah...

74
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,725
Well?

75
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,926
Yeah! That was so cool!

76
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:37,395
And this! This gun of yours
is super fast!

77
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,830
[girl 1] Woah, check it out!

78
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:45,000
[girl 2] Hey, isn't that the
German's third‐generation?

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,003
[girl 3] I heard that it's
still in its trial period
here in this country.

80
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:52,472
Laura Bodewig!

81
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,206
What? Bodewig?

82
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,908
That representative
contender from Germany
who slapped Ichika?!

83
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,277
Ichika Orimura...

84
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,611
That's right.

85
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,846
[Laura] So, you also have
a personal machine.

86
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,048
That will make it much easier.

87
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:09,549
Now fight me!

88
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,050
No way.

89
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,917
There's no reason.

90
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,885
[Laura] You might not have one,

91
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,086
but I do.

92
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,953
[Ichika] It doesn't have to
be right now, does it?

93
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,089
The class league match
is coming up soon,

94
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,123
maybe then, all right?

95
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,691
Or not...

96
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:33,898
[Ichika] Charles!
[Charles] I can't believe she
just challenged you like that!

97
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:37,500
Of course Germans do get
hot‐and‐bothered easily!

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,169
How dare you block my way with
some pathetic second‐generation
French machine?

99
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,839
A machine that works much
better than your German
third‐generation type,

100
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,041
which currently has no prospect
for mass‐production!

101
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,743
[instructor] Attention:
Students on the field!

102
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:55,412
What are you doing down there?

103
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:58,013
I will allow you to escape
for the day.

104
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:08,586
Okay, what was that all about,
Ichika? Spill it!

105
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:13,356
Yes, did something happen
between you and Laura
sometime in the past?

106
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,061
[Charles] Um, Ichika,
are you okay?

107
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:23,896
Yeah and thanks for saving me
earlier, by the way.

108
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:25,997
I really owe you one for that.

109
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,068
[Charles] Well, I'm heading back
to the room now.

110
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,737
What? Aren't you going to take
a shower here?

111
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:38,839
[Ichika] Hey, how come you
never do that?
[Charles] Uh...

112
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,641
Does my being naked around
you bother you that much?

113
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,309
Uh, no! You being naked doesn't
bother me at all!

114
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,077
Oh come on, I know that it does!

115
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,878
Why don't we get dressed
together for a change?

116
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,646
No thanks, I'm fine...

117
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,648
We're roommates!
Don't be like that!

118
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:55,750
[screaming]

119
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,817
[Charles] I have to go!
[Ichika] Charles?

120
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,686
Huh...?

121
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:10,259
[Laura] I do not approve.

122
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:15,328
In fact, I will never approve
that you're her brother!

123
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,898
Please answer me, mentor!

124
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,599
Why are you at a place
like this?!

125
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,801
[Chifuyu] Don't make me say the
same thing over and over again.

126
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,669
I have my own role to play.

127
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,236
That's all you need to know.

128
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,638
[Laura] What kind of role could
you possibly have to play...

129
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:32,239
here in the Far East?

130
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,673
I'm begging you, mentor!

131
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:36,175
Please come back and teach us
in Germany once again!

132
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,577
You can't even exert half
of your ability at this
wretched place!

133
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:43,012
[Chifuyu] Uh huh.
[Laura] The students at this
academy do not deserve...

134
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,347
[Laura] to be taught by someone
of your stature!

135
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,048
They lack a sense of danger and

136
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:50,450
they mistaken the IS for
some kind of extravagent
fashion accessory!

137
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,119
I find it unbelievable that you
could even give the time of day
to these people!

138
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,954
I think I've heard more than
enough, little girl.

139
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,324
You've grown up quite a bit
since I last saw you.

140
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:05,494
But not enough to assume you're
the chosen one when you're
only fifteen.

141
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:09,962
[Laura] I was just...
[Chifuyu] I'm a busy woman and
you need to get back to your
dorm, girl.

142
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,839
[Chifuyu] Male student over
there, were you eavesdropping?

143
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,173
Or indulging in some aberrant
sexual behavior?

144
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,209
How can you say that, Chifuyu?
You're my sister for
cripes sake!

145
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:32,977
At school, you will call
me Miss Orimura.

146
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:34,678
Yes ma'am.

147
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,913
You don't have time to waste
lurking in the bushes,

148
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,447
you should be out
there training.

149
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,415
At the rate you're going, you're
going to be defeated...

150
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,950
in the first round of the next
month's tournament.

151
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,484
[Ichika] I know that.

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,352
In that case, fine.

153
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,854
Hey, wait a second!

154
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:52,723
I wanted to ask you something
about what Laura said to me
in class earlier...

155
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:56,592
[Ichika] She said she doesn't
approve of me being
your brother.

156
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,193
Was she talking about...

157
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,728
the way you missed out
on the chance...

158
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,629
to win the second championship
because of me‐

159
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,163
[Chifuyu] That's all in
the past, kid.

160
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,731
There's no need for you to
worry about it now.

161
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,466
Later, 'kay?

162
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,204
[Ichika] <i>It was the</i>
<i>2nd Mondo Grosso,</i>

163
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:18,673
<i>the second IS world</i>
<i>championship...</i>

164
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:22,375
<i>And on the day the final</i>
<i>match was supposed to</i>
<i>take place,</i>

165
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,376
<i>someone kidnapped me.</i>

166
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:31,147
<i>To this day, I still have</i>
<i>no idea why they did it.</i>

167
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,015
<i>But I was detained</i>
<i>and imprisoned.</i>

168
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:43,455
<i>And my big sister Chifuyu</i>
<i>abandoned the final match in</i>
<i>order to come and rescue me.</i>

169
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,590
<i>So, my sister lost the</i>
<i>final match by default.</i>

170
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,360
<i>No one had any doubt</i>
<i>that she was about to</i>
<i>win back‐to‐back victories,</i>

171
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,595
<i>so it caused a controversy when</i>
<i>she pulled out of the match.</i>

172
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,629
<i>And to top it off, in order to</i>
<i>repay the German Army...</i>

173
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,299
<i>for helping find information</i>
<i>about the location where I</i>
<i>was being held,</i>

174
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,336
<i>Chifuyu agreed to stay there</i>
<i>and serve as an instructor</i>
<i>for the German IS unit for</i>
<i>over a year.</i>

175
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:09,137
<i>I felt as though it</i>
<i>was all my fault,</i>

176
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,006
<i>like I was good‐for‐nothing...</i>

177
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:14,308
<i>A totally pathetic excuse</i>
<i>for a brother.</i>

178
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:19,111
<i>Which is why I can't let</i>
<i>my big sister watch over</i>
<i>me anymore.</i>

179
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,545
I'm back!

180
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:22,846
Are you here, Charles?

181
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:25,047
[running water]

182
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,387
[Ichika] Oh, that's right.

183
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:38,790
Hey, Charles, I think we're out
of body soap in there, right?

184
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,257
I brought you a new‐

185
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,506
Well uh...

186
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,808
I brought you the soap.

187
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:10,976
Oh yes, thank you.

188
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,180
[Ichika] Well, see you later.

189
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,447
[Charles] Uh...

190
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,570
[Ichika] Umm... So...

191
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,672
Do you want some tea?

192
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:59,341
Uh, sure, why not?

193
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,244
Here.

194
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:07,179
Oh, thank you.

195
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,047
[Charles] Ah!
[Ichika] Hey!

196
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:12,049
Oh God! Hot! Hot! Hot!

197
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,015
Sorry!

198
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,817
Ichika! Are you all right?

199
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:15,984
Let me see it.

200
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:17,418
[Charles] Oh! It turned red.

201
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,687
I'm so sorry!

202
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,288
It's okay, I'll be fine...

203
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:22,521
But the thing is...

204
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:26,191
those... they're... touching me.

205
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:31,827
You're a pervert!

206
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,396
[Ichika] Me? How in the hell do
you figure that?!

207
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,099
So, why did you pretend
to be a guy?

208
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,402
My family wanted me to do it.

209
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,469
[Ichika] Your family?

210
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:46,804
Oh, you mean your
family's corporation...

211
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:50,406
Oui, my papa is the
company's CEO.

212
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:53,441
And this whole plan was
his direct order.

213
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,876
[Ichika] What?

214
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:57,077
To be perfectly honest...

215
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,113
I am not the child of his wife.

216
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:06,683
[Charles] I was separated from
him for a very long time,

217
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,685
but two years ago,
he took me in.

218
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:13,120
That was right after
my mama died.

219
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,489
The people from the Dunois
family came to pick me up.

220
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,124
After various tests,

221
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:23,794
they found out that I was
exceptionally compatible
with the IS.

222
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:25,361
And though it was unofficial,

223
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:29,798
they secretly made me a test
pilot for the IS.

224
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:34,166
But I have only seen my father
twice before,

225
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:38,169
and we have only spoke
for no more than an hour.

226
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:45,874
And then Dunois
Corporation encountered
some financial difficulties.

227
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:47,309
[Ichika] Difficulties?

228
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,943
But I thought that they
ranked third in the world...

229
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,611
when it comes to
manufactuing IS units.

230
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:56,781
That is correct, but the Revive
is a second‐generation type.

231
00:14:56,881 --> 00:15:01,818
[Charles] Currently, IS research
is focusing on development of
the third‐generation type.

232
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:05,786
I think the reason Miss Cecilia
and Miss Laura transferred to
this school...

233
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:09,956
was because they needed
to collect data for
that development.

234
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:15,026
The Dunois Corporation has
already begun developing
third‐generation models,

235
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,860
but progress has been slow.

236
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,263
And at this rate, their
development permit is in
danger of being withdrawn.

237
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:25,499
But what does any of that have
to do with you coming here and
pretending to be a boy?

238
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:30,236
[Charles] It's simple.
I'm merely the
advertising platform
for attracting attention.

239
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,371
As for this charade, it was felt
I had a better chance...

240
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:36,706
of meeting you if I pretended
to be a boy.

241
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:42,309
The hope was that I
could collect data on
your machine as well as you.

242
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,111
[Charles] Basically, what they
asked me to do...

243
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,346
was to come here and
steal your data...

244
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,348
by pretending that I was a boy
named Charles.

245
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:56,218
Now I feel a huge burden
has been lifted.

246
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:58,487
Thank you for listening to me.

247
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:02,322
And I am so very sorry about
lying to you all this time.

248
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:06,559
[Ichika] But you never
wanted this, right?

249
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,826
I mean, this entire plot.

250
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,261
There's no way that you did!

251
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,762
Uh, Ichika?

252
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:14,497
Our parents are important or we
wouldn't be here without them,

253
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,065
but even so...

254
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:18,566
A parent can't just use a kid
as a tool like that!

255
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,901
That's wrong in so many ways!

256
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,402
[Charles] Ichika...

257
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:25,904
[Ichika] My sister and I were
both abandoned as kids...

258
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:27,905
so I know how you feel.

259
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:31,841
The difference is that I have
no interest in ever seeing
them again.

260
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,942
But you do.

261
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,910
So, what are you going
to do now?

262
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,411
What am I...?

263
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,713
Now that you found out
I am a girl,

264
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:44,015
I am sure I will be called
back to my home country.

265
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,717
I don't really know
about the rest.

266
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:50,052
Sent to jail, if I'm lucky.

267
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:52,421
[Ichika] What if you just
stay here?
[Charles] What?

268
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,089
You'll be fine as long as
I don't say anything right?

269
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,224
And even if they do find out,
I'm sure your father...

270
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,258
or his company can't do
anything about it at this point.

271
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,861
It's right here in the IS
Academy Special manual...

272
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,597
All students of IS Academy are
under its exclusive control,

273
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:11,733
and no nation, organization or
other group can interfere with
their attendance here.

274
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,501
In other words, you'll be
safe for at least the
next three years...

275
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,869
as long as you keep
attending this school.

276
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,006
[Ichika] And with that
protection, you'll have
time to engineer a more
permanent solution.

277
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,207
I can't believe you knew that.

278
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:26,275
I mean there are fifty‐five
of those to remember.

279
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,444
Well, it might not seem like it,
but I do study hard!

280
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,712
[laughing]

281
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:33,213
[Charles] Ichika...

282
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:38,416
Thank you for covering for me.

283
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,318
Well, no problem.

284
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,687
[Ichika] Uh, your breast!
I can almost see your breast!

285
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:51,525
Oh! Uh... does it
really bother you?

286
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,392
Well of course they do!

287
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,028
Would you like to see them?

288
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,562
[Ichika] Say what?!

289
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,730
You are a pervert.

290
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,064
[Ichika] Me?! Who's a‐ what?!

291
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,098
Where the hell did that
come from?!

292
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,267
[Cecilia] Ichika,
are you in there?

293
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,669
I noticed that you haven't
had dinner yet.

294
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,370
Are you feeling ill?

295
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,607
Ichika, I'm coming in.

296
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,843
Oh, what are you doing
over there?

297
00:18:19,943 --> 00:18:22,010
N‐Nothing, it's just
that Charles...

298
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,345
told me that he might be coming
down with a cold,

299
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,946
so I put a blanket on him.

300
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,113
[Cecilia] Oh really?
[fake coughing]

301
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:29,214
Dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

302
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:32,250
Would it be all right with you
if I borrowed Ichika for a bit?

303
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,252
[fake coughing]
[Charles] Go ahead.

304
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:37,354
Well it just so happens that I
haven't had my dinner either.

305
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,121
Would you care to dine with me?

306
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:41,389
Uh, sure?
[fake coughing]

307
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,290
[Charles] Enjoy yourselves.
[giggling]

308
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,225
[Cecilia] Let's be off then!
[Ichika] Hey...

309
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,627
What are you doing?!

310
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,963
We're on our way to dinner.
Just the two of us together.

311
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,330
[Houki] But why do you have to
have your arm through his arm...

312
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,131
and get so close to him
to do that?

313
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:00,634
Oh, don't you know
that a gentleman is always
expected to escort a lady?

314
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:04,136
Actually it feels more like
I'm being escorted...

315
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:06,305
Then, I'm coming along
with you two!

316
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,107
I didn't have enough at dinner
earlier, so I'm still hungry.

317
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:14,277
Very well, but eating like that
is sure to put even more weight
on that boyish figure of yours.

318
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,744
Hmph. Well that's none
of your business, is it?

319
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,046
[Houki] We'll have some
sword practice later.

320
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,047
That's a good way to burn
off calories!

321
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:22,582
[Ichika] Ugh,
more with the hitting!

322
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:25,484
Then it's settled.
Let's be off, shall we?

323
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,918
Miss Houki, what do you think
you're playing at here?

324
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,821
[Houki] You said a gentleman
is expected to escort a
lady, didn't you?

325
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,989
[Ichika] Hold on, you two!

326
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,723
It's really hard to
walk like this‐

327
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,224
Owww!

328
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:38,158
[Cecilia] Do you mean you don't
have anything else...

329
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,559
to say about this situation?

330
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,428
[Houki] Yes, such as how
deliriously happy you are,

331
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:43,795
you lucky dog.

332
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:49,965
[door opening and closing]

333
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,766
[Ichika] Hey, it's me.

334
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:52,834
I think...

335
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,402
Uh, welcome back.

336
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:56,737
Is there something wrong?

337
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,505
Don't you worry about it.

338
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,907
[Ichika] I brought some food
for you.

339
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,542
Thank you, I am hungry.

340
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,011
What's wrong?

341
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:11,279
[Charles] Uh well...

342
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,850
Oh, you can't use chopsticks?

343
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,218
I have been practicing,
but still...

344
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,153
No problem, I'll just run back
and get you a fork, okay?

345
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,522
Huh? No, that's okay.

346
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:30,025
You know, you're going to have
to learn how to take advantage
of your roommate's kindness a
little better.

347
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,393
[Ichika] What is it they say
about he who hesitates is lost?

348
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:36,529
So, you take advantage of
me this time...

349
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:39,864
And I'll take advantage of
you some other time, okay?

350
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:45,800
[Charles] Well,
all right... I...

351
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,301
[Ichika] Hm?

352
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:50,671
Couldn't you just feed me?

353
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:57,242
You said I could take advantage
of your kindness...

354
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,209
[Charles] No?

355
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:04,379
Okay! My word is my bond!

356
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:09,182
Here comes the IS...

357
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,116
Now say "ah"!

358
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:12,684
Aah...

359
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,088
[Ichika] So, do you like it?

360
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:20,556
Oh, very!

361
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,191
That's good to hear!
More fish coming up!

362
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,726
[Charles] Well, I think I want
to have some rice next.

363
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:28,194
You want rice now?

364
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:30,363
[Ichika] Here it comes!
Get ready!

365
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,964
Hangar open! Say "ah"!

366
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:34,465
[Charles] Aah!

367
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,000
[Ichika] Oh, you got some
rice on your...

368
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,035
[Charles] Oh! Better get it.

369
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,836
[Ichika] Okay, I guess I have
no choice...

370
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,076
[Laura] Mentor...

371
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,317
Your absolute and
incomparable strength...

372
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:57,854
is a goal I seek. The very
reason for my continued
existence.

373
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:05,191
And Ichika Orimura...

374
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,660
The person who cast a stain upon
my mentor's name...

375
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:10,618
I swear that...

376
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:13,885
I will get rid of you by any
means necessary!

377
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,072
[girl 1] Oh, my goodness, it
looks like there's a fight
in the arena!

378
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,139
[girl 2] No way!
Who's fighting?

379
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,306
[girl 3] It looks like one side
is the powerful duo...

380
00:23:58,406 --> 00:23:59,906
of Cecilia Alcott and Rinin Fan!

381
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,172
[girl 1] And their opponent
is Laura Bodewig!

382
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:05,106
[girl 2] Two against one?
That sounds like too much
of a handicap!

383
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:07,539
[girl 3] Hang on, something
seems to be wrong!

384
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,639
[girl 1] What?!

385
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,172
[girl 3] The next episode,
"Blue Days ‐ Red Switch"

386
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:16,906
You don't want to miss
the true power of the
third‐generation type IS!
