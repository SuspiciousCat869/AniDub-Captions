1
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:05,018
[Ichika] But even after six
years, I recognized you right
away, Houki!

2
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,490
[Houki] Don't look!

3
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,327
[Cecilia] This calls for a duel!

4
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:54,454
[school bell]

5
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:03,934
Orimura, I'm afraid that it
will be a while befor your
IS is ready for you.

6
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,170
What?

7
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,239
On the plus side,
due to certain issues,

8
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:09,477
the school will provide you with
a personal IS.

9
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:12,848
[Girl 1] What? A personal IS
when he's only a freshman?

10
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:16,187
[Girl 2] In other words,
that means the government
is supporting this?

11
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,558
[Girl 3] That's so awesome!
I want my own too!

12
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:25,501
Is having your own IS really
that major of a deal?

13
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,905
I'm actually rather relieved
to hear that!

14
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:31,611
[Cecilia] After all, in a class
representative selection match
between you and I,

15
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,947
the outcome is already obvious.

16
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:39,689
But it's simply not fair for you
to use a training model whilst
I pilot my own personal unit.

17
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,525
Hold on,

18
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,661
you have your own IS as well?

19
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,096
Oh, don't you know?

20
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:48,270
Very well then. As you are
a commoner, I shall have
to explain.

21
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,877
I, Cecilia Alcott, am the
glorious representative
contender for Great Britain.

22
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:57,216
In other words, I currently own
my own, personal IS.

23
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:00,455
There are only 467
IS units worldwide.

24
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,862
So, obviously those who have
their own personal units are
the elites of the elite...

25
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:07,833
amongst the planet's population
of seven billion!

26
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,504
Only 467? That's all?

27
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:15,679
That's because the
central component of
all IS technology, the core,
has never been released.

28
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,785
As a result, there are only 467
machines in the entire world.

29
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:24,158
And Dr. Tabane Shinonono has
personally produced every one
of those cores.

30
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:27,062
[Ichika] <i>Wait, isn't that</i>
<i>Houki's sister?</i>

31
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:31,503
[Girl 1] Supposedly, the IS core
is like a self contained
black box.

32
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:36,477
This is because no one other
than Dr. Shinonono can
create one.

33
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:41,652
[Girl 2] But the thing is,
so far she's refused to
manufacture more than a
certain number of cores.

34
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:44,223
Therefore, countries,
corporations and
organizations...

35
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:51,467
are forced to conduct their
research, development and
training using the limited
number of IS units.

36
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,237
[Chifuyu] To complete our little
history lesson,

37
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:56,542
personal IS units were
originally only intended
for those...

38
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:59,146
sponsored by governments
or corporations.

39
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,182
However, your case
is exceptional.

40
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,689
Therefore, they will provide
you with a personal IS for data
collection purposes.

41
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,858
[Chifuyu] Is that all clear?

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,027
Uh, I guess so...

43
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,564
Um, excuse me, ma'am...

44
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,900
Do you know if the Miss
Shinonono in our class...

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,604
is related to Dr. Shinonono
by any chance?

46
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:18,909
Actually, your classmate
is her younger sister.

47
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,379
[class] Huh?!

48
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,682
[Aikawa] Seriously?
She's her sister?!

49
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,651
[Girl 2] I heard that Dr.
Shinonono has gone missing,

50
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,557
and every country and
all corporations has been
desperately trying to find her.

51
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,761
[Tanimoto] Yeah, don't you know
where she is?

52
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,532
She has nothing to do with me!

53
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,139
I'm not my sister.

54
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:42,145
And there's nothing I can
tell you about her.

55
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,752
[bummed class]

56
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,259
Alright Miss Yamada,
shall we start?

57
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,563
Guh! Oh, right!

58
00:04:53,663 --> 00:04:56,400
[Maya] Now then...
[Ichika] <i>I don't remember there</i>
<i>being any bad blood...</i>

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,237
[Ichika] between Houki and
Tabane.
[Maya] Everyone open your
textbooks.

60
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:01,608
[Maya] We'll continue from where
we left off yesterday.

61
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:06,249
The IS, or Infinite Stratos,

62
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,656
displays a special energy
barrier that operates as
protection for its pilot.

63
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,527
The unit's system has something
similar to a consciousness.

64
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:18,802
So, through shared dialog and
time spent together, the two of
you will actually get to know
each other.

65
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,874
Depending on how much time a
pilot spends controling an IS,

66
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:25,078
it begins to understand the
user's characteristics.

67
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,482
I just don't understand this.

68
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,155
So, your IS isn't just a tool,

69
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:35,294
instead, think of it as your
big, mechanical partner.

70
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,197
Are there any questions so far?

71
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,700
Yes, ma'am!

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,337
So, did you mean "partner" as in
boyfriend or girlfriend?

73
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:44,441
D'oh! I'm not sure! That is...

74
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,945
I'm not experienced that way
so I don't know.

75
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,147
[giggling]

76
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,783
But I wonder... oh...

77
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,319
[student] You're so cute!

78
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,692
<i>Is this really a typical all</i>
<i>girls' school atmosphere?</i>

79
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,046
[Ichika] Hey, Houki...

80
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,351
Miss Shinonono!

81
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,987
Let's go eat lunch!

82
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,589
[Ichika] Would anyone like
to join us?

83
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,192
Yes, me, me!

84
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,028
Oh! Me too!

85
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,365
I made my lunch,
but I'm coming too!

86
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,605
[Ichika] Sure, we should all try
to get along with our fellow
classmates, okay?

87
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,641
You agree with me, right?

88
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,910
I think I'll pass.

89
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,747
Daw, don't be such
a grumpy‐face. Come on!

90
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,384
I already said I'm not going!

91
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:35,353
Oh, you don't feel like
walking, eh?

92
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:36,889
I'll carry you piggyback!

93
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:39,093
[Houki] Let go!
[Ichika] Hey!

94
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,567
[Ichika] Ow, ow...
[class murmuring]

95
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,237
You're so strong...

96
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:49,709
Yeah well... maybe you're the
one who's gotten weak?

97
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,213
Hmph. That was a little trick
from my kendo training.

98
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,581
[Nohohon] Um, well...

99
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,418
[bold girl] We think that maybe
we should...

100
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,154
[Tanimoto] ...pass this time.

101
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:03,230
Yeah, what? You have something
else stupid to say to me?

102
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:05,299
Houki!

103
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,735
I told you not to call me that!

104
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:08,371
Come on, let's go eat.

105
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,241
Hey, give it a rest!

106
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,244
Shut up and let's go.

107
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,660
You didn't have to get so upset
like that.

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,729
I was just trying to
look after you, you know.

109
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:26,899
Yeah? Who asked you to do
that anyway?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,737
Even if someone asked me,
I wouldn't normally do that.

111
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,740
I did it because
it's you, Houki.

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,111
What? What's that mean?

113
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,347
[Ichika] Look, I owe a lot to
your aunt too.

114
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,718
Besides, we're childhood
friends and roommates.

115
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:41,822
So, at least let me meddle
in your life a little.

116
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:44,694
Well I guess...
Thank you...

117
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:47,464
[cook] Here you go,
two daily specials.

118
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:48,966
Thank you.

119
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:52,038
Hey, Houki, did you see any
empty tables on the way in?

120
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,043
There's one right over there!

121
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,849
Great, what'd I do now?

122
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:04,357
[Ichika] Hey, Houki.
[Houki] Yeah? What now?

123
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:07,429
Would you be willing to teach
me more about the IS?

124
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,068
'Cause I think I'm going to
lose to Cecilia the way
things are going.

125
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,905
Yeah, because you let
her provoke you!

126
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:18,246
I know that, but please help me!

127
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:22,452
[senior] Hey, aren't you the one
that everyone's talking about?

128
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:25,923
You're going to be competing
against a representative
contender,

129
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:28,327
but you've never flown for
real, have you?

130
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:31,466
If you want, I could teach you
lots of things about the IS.

131
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,934
[Houki] No, thanks.

132
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,238
Actually, I'm the one who's
going to be teaching him.

133
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,976
But you're a freshman
too, right?

134
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,579
I'm a senior, after all.

135
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,618
I think I'd do a much better
job teaching him the ropes.

136
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:47,190
But I am Tabane
Shinonono's sister.

137
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,028
[Houki] But thanks for
the offer.

138
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:53,333
Fine! I guess some things
can't be helped.

139
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,973
So then, you will teach me?

140
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:03,882
[smack, smack, crack]

141
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,952
[Ichika] Ah! Ow!
[thud]

142
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,930
[Houki] Okay, what in the
hell is going on here?

143
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,935
I‐I don't know what you mean.

144
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:18,639
How did you allow yourself to
become so weak?!

145
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,775
What clubs were you in in
middle school?

146
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,110
[Ichika] The "go home" club!

147
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,847
Three years of
perfect attendance!

148
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,082
Then you'll retrain!

149
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,152
This problem comes
before the IS!

150
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,656
Effective immediately, you will
be in training with me...

151
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:31,324
for three hours everyday
after school!

152
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,828
[Ichika] Hang on, I wanted you
to teach me about the IS!

153
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:36,900
And I said, this problem
comes before the IS!

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,536
Man, Orimura is...

155
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,804
...kinda weak.

156
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:42,408
Do you think he can really
control an IS?

157
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,266
I wonder if I came down just a
little too hard on him?

158
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,309
No way, he had it coming!

159
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,347
It was obvious he hadn't
wielded a sword for at
least a year!

160
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:11,987
Otherwise, there's no way he
would've ever lost to me
so easily!

161
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,289
He's changed...

162
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,693
in the past six years when
I didn't see him.

163
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:18,597
Ichika's really changed so much.

164
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:33,254
So, this means his intensive
training will begin tomorrow!

165
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:37,260
That means I'll get to
be alone with Ichika
after school‐

166
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,568
No, I'm not thinking about
things like that at all!

167
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:46,975
It's just that I'm genuinely
upset over my childhood
friend's weakness, right!

168
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,978
That's why it's okay!

169
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,731
[Ichika] Uh, Houki...
[Houki] What now?

170
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:06,371
Well, the thing is, you promised
me that you were going to teach
me about the IS.

171
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:09,042
Hey, don't turn away from me!

172
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:12,881
Thanks to you, the only thing
I've done in this week is
practice kendo techniques!

173
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:15,084
Well, I can't do anything
about that!

174
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,655
And your IS hasn't been
delivered yet anyway.

175
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:22,330
Even without one, you could
still at least teach me stuff
about the basics!

176
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,400
And I said, don't turn away
from me!

177
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:31,344
[Ichika] So, that's her personal
IS? Woah...

178
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,882
Orimura! Orimura!

179
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:36,217
[Maya] Orimura!

180
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,356
It's here! Your personal IS has
just arrived!

181
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,760
Orimura, you need to get
ready at once.

182
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,063
[Chifuyu] The amount of time
we can use the arena is limited.

183
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,635
You'll have to learn how to
make it yours during the
match itself.

184
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,589
[Maya] This is Orimura's
personal IS,

185
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,692
the Byakushiki!

186
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,443
[Chifuyu] Hurry up and
get suited.

187
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:17,014
Since time's limited,
we'll do the formatting
and fitting...

188
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:18,850
while the match is in progress.

189
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,552
Huh?

190
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,388
What's wrong?

191
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:37,311
It's not like the first time I
touched an IS. There's
something different.

192
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,849
[Maya] Orimura,
are you all right?

193
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:41,317
Uh huh...

194
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,355
[Ichika] I'm just fine.

195
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,624
There's something familiar
about it.

196
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:51,233
I understand it. I can
understand what it is
and its purpose.

197
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,536
Show you entrust your
life to it.

198
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:55,406
[Chifuyu] Let it take control.

199
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,810
The system will optimize
the rest.

200
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,315
[Byakushiki] <Access.>

201
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,686
<System, start.>

202
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,223
[Ichika] Byakushiki...

203
00:13:06,323 --> 00:13:07,959
This is Byakushiki.

204
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:12,232
[Maya] Cecilia Allcot's machine
is called Blue Tears.

205
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,268
It's a long‐range model IS.

206
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,838
Blue Tears, got it.

207
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:17,273
[Maya] In every IS unit,

208
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,844
there's a feature refered to as
"absolute defense".

209
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:24,184
It's primary function is always
to protect the pilot's life
during any attack.

210
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:28,758
However, that deployment would
cause your shield energy to be
badly depleated.

211
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,460
Do you understand that?

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,997
[Chifuyu] So, Orimura,
are you feeling up to this?

213
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,768
Yeah, piece of cake.

214
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:37,504
We'll see.

215
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:40,008
[Ichika] Hey Houki...
[Houki] Hm? Uh, huh?

216
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,044
[Ichika] Here we go.

217
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,047
Oh, okay...

218
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,883
Win this!

219
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:49,890
I'm off!

220
00:13:57,068 --> 00:14:00,940
[Cecilia] Just so you know,
this is your last chance!
[Ichika] To do what?

221
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,279
It's obvious to everyone
that I'm going to defeat
you overwhelmingly.

222
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,453
So why not simply apologize to
me right now and I just might
be able to forgive you.

223
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:14,395
[Ichika] You can't really call
that a chance!

224
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:17,300
Oh I can't?
Well, too bad for you.

225
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,336
Now then...

226
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,440
[alarm]

227
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,777
Time to say goodbye!

228
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:42,304
[Ichika] Damn it! I can't keep
up with Baykushiki's reactions!

229
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:44,207
Now you will dance for me!
That's right!

230
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:48,180
Dance to the waltz that
Cecilia Alcott and Blue
Tears are playing!

231
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,418
Aw crap! The shield is
getting weak!

232
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,421
Where are my weapons?

233
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:55,391
[Ichika] Is that's all?!

234
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:57,795
It's better than bare hands,
I guess!

235
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,102
So this is your brilliant
plan, is it?

236
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,574
Challenging my long‐range IS
in hand‐to‐hand combat?

237
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,510
Don't be ridiculous!

238
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,888
[cheering]

239
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,398
You're the first opponent to
last this long.

240
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,338
You've fought longer against
Blue Tears in an initial
match than anyone!

241
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,541
And I must applaud you for that.

242
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,978
[Ichika] Thanks a lot.

243
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,650
But now the time has come
for the finale!

244
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:43,499
I'll take your left leg!

245
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:46,838
[Ichika] It's all or nothing!

246
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:02,395
Orimura!

247
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,930
Ichika!

248
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:08,737
[Cecilia] You're reckless,
aren't you?

249
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,775
But it's a pointless struggle!

250
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:19,521
Well now I finally get it!

251
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,744
[Ichika] Your weapons won't move
without your commands. That's
the trick.

252
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,531
And there's more than that,

253
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,269
you can't make any other
attacks while you're in motion.

254
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,040
[Ichika] That's because you're
focused solely on defense.

255
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,243
Right?

256
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,617
That was reallyy impressive.

257
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:39,722
I can't believe this is his
second time in an IS.

258
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,024
Ugh, that idiot...

259
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,392
He's too worked up.

260
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:44,162
But why would you say that?

261
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:47,634
Haven't you noticed the way he
keeps opening and closing
his left hand?

262
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:51,306
Whenever the kid does that,
he starts makeing really
stupid mistakes.

263
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:54,578
[Maya] I get it. I guess it
helps to be his sister.

264
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,055
[Ichika] Two more left!

265
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:05,361
<i>But I know she's going to</i>
<i>attack where my response</i>
<i>speed is the slowest.</i>

266
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,569
That means...

267
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,006
It's to my advantage to
close the distance!

268
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,343
I see, he fell for it.

269
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,947
So sorry. There are more
than four!

270
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,184
Aw crap!

271
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,530
Ichika!

272
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:30,934
The IS saved him.

273
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,837
He's such a little twit...

274
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,828
Ichika...

275
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,164
What's happening?

276
00:17:50,264 --> 00:17:53,068
The shape of Orimura's
personal IS has changed!

277
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,137
<Format setting complete.>

278
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,606
Huh? What's this?

279
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,044
That can't be!
That's your first shift?

280
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:03,852
How could anyone have fought
an entire battle like this with
their IS in a default setting?

281
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,288
[Ichika] I'm not sure what the
heck I've been doing,

282
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:10,662
but it looks like this IS has
finally become my own.

283
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,936
[Ichika] The Yukihira Nigata?

284
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:20,010
Isn't the Yukihira the same
weapon Chifuyu used?

285
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,950
Man, I really do have the best
big sister in the entire world!

286
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,424
[Ichika] But I think it's
about time to change the
relationship...

287
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,761
from where I'm the one who
always has to be protected.

288
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,266
From now on, I'm going to be
protecting as well.

289
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,504
Just what are you
talking about?

290
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:40,508
[Ichika] I'm saying I will
defend my sister's name.

291
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:44,447
It'll make her look lame if her
brother's a candy‐ass weakling.

292
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:47,853
Honestly! You're such a pain!

293
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,824
Too late! I've seen them now!

294
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:57,534
Yeah, I can do this!

295
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,343
[horn]

296
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:05,046
[announcement] The match
is concluded.

297
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,450
Winner, Cecilia Alcott.

298
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,386
[Ichika] What?
[Cecilia] What?

299
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:10,655
[students] What?!

300
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:12,057
Huh?

301
00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:13,525
Wha‐?

302
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,910
Okay, so why'd I lose again?

303
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,148
You lost because you used the
barrier‐disabling attack.

304
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:31,687
Without taking into account how
using it would affect
everything else.

305
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,656
The barrier‐disabling attack?

306
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:38,498
Which punctures the opponent's
barrier and passes the impact
directly to its body.

307
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,434
That's something only
Yukihira can do.

308
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:44,206
[Chifuyu] However, that ability
has to cannibalize your own
shield energy...

309
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:45,909
in order to function.

310
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,415
Actually, I have to admit
that when I won the First
Mondo Grosso,

311
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:51,418
it was mostly as a result of
that one ability.

312
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:57,527
I see. So that's why
Byakushiki's remaining shield
energy suddenly dropped to zero.

313
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:00,197
[Maya] When a competitor's
shield energy becomes zero,

314
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,200
that player loses the IS battle.

315
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,305
The barrier‐disabling attack
does damage your opponent,

316
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,909
but in exchange it will cost you
your shield.

317
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,613
It's really a classic
double edge sword.

318
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:13,918
Right and it means your
IS is defective.

319
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:15,187
Defective, how?

320
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:17,891
[Chifuyu] Okay, maybe that
was a bad way to phrase it.

321
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:21,998
An IS isn't complete to begin
with, so it can't be defective
per se.

322
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,270
But since yours is so much more
offense‐oriented than others,

323
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,506
it can't be handled
the same way.

324
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,046
[Maya] At the moment, your IS is
in stand‐by mode,

325
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:35,351
but all you have to do it and
it'll deploy right away.

326
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:39,625
However, there are a lot of
regulations, so read this
thoroughly.

327
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:02,293
And now she'll be the class
representative, huh?

328
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,632
And what does that look mean?

329
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,338
Well, are you...

330
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,207
upset that you lost?

331
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,843
Well, yeah, sure.

332
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:15,914
Uh, so I guess
starting tomorrow,

333
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,019
maybe we ought to start some
intensive IS training?

334
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,655
I guess.

335
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,862
Umm... You still...

336
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,699
You do want me to continue
teaching you, right?

337
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,968
Of course I do.

338
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,405
I'd rather ask you than any
other girl.

339
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:35,043
I mean, you're Tabane's sister,
so who else would know as much?

340
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,846
O‐Okay...

341
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,350
All right, I understand.

342
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,988
I have to then.

343
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,727
Right, I here by agree to teach
you about the IS!

344
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:49,433
Starting tomorrow, I want you
to be waiting for me everday
after school!

345
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,836
[Houki] Okay?
[Ichika] Yes ma'am!

346
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:54,407
Hey, wait!

347
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:59,782
[water running]

348
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,944
[Cecilia] <i>Why am I feeling</i>
<i>this way?</i>

349
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,726
<i>Even though I was the winner?</i>

350
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:17,949
Ichika Orimura...

351
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,316
[Girl 1] Hey, who's that girl?

352
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,649
[Girl 2] And how come she seems
to be so close to Orimura?

353
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:57,716
[Girl 3] She's the one from
China, who has her own
personal IS!

354
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,049
Supposedly, she's Orimura's
friend from middle school.

355
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:04,416
[Girl 1] Not only that, she's
the class representative of
Class 1‐2! So, that means...

356
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:07,116
[Girl 2] She's going to fight
him at the class match!

357
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,549
[Girl 1] The next episode:

358
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,916
"The Transfer Student is the
Second Childhood Friend"

359
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,749
[Girl 3] Oh, I wonder if her IS
wears an outfit that's like a
Chinese dress?!

360
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:18,649
[Girls 1 and 2] No way, that
would be impossible!
