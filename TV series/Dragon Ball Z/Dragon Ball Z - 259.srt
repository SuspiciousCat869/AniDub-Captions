00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,500
the malicious
new form of Majin Buu

3
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,583
unleashed his
Human Extinction Attack,

4
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,791
bringing the Earth's
dwindling population

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,541
only a handful away from zero.

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,333
Tired of the
effortless plunder,

7
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,958
Majin Buu desired
only one thing.

8
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,416
A fight with his
promised challenger.

9
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,375
And in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

10
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,625
that's exactly what he got.

11
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,166
[NARRATOR]
So the battle began.

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,333
Majin Buu versus Gotenks,

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,000
the cocky fusion
of Goten and Trunks.

14
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,041
Drawing from the
borrowed week of training

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,666
inside the time chamber,

16
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,875
Gotenks deployed an onslaught
of never-before-seen,

17
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,333
and somewhat
juvenile, techniques.

18
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,416
Hold on. Ugh!

19
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,291
[yells, grunts]

20
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,708
[NARRATOR]
None of them worked,

21
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,750
and Gotenks was forced
to fight more seriously.

22
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,625
After revealing he could power
up to Super Saiyan levels

23
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,708
while already in a fused state,

24
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,875
Gotenks prepared for
his favorite new trick.

25
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,458
[GOTENKS] It's new so sorry
if it's a little sloppy.

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,500
A Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack!

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,958
Huh?

28
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,916
[NARRATOR] The fate
of the empty planet

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
hinges on the
strength of a child,

30
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,875
and with the imagination
only a child could posses,

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,208
Gotenks has delivered,

32
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,958
producing what is perhaps
the most bizarre technique

33
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,500
in Z Fighter history.

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,291
What... is that?

35
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,083
[NARRATOR] Now,
as the battle within

36
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,916
this altered-time
dimension rages on,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,625
two important
questions must be asked...

38
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,000
[SUPERGHOST]
Ready Buu?

39
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,041
[NARRATOR] Who will
claim victory in this fight

40
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,833
between Gotenks and Majin Buu?

41
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,208
And secondly, what in
the world is going on?

42
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,708
[GOTENKS]
You're dead.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,666
[SUPERGHOST laughing]

44
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,625
Nnahhhh!

45
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,583
Do I scare you?

46
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,833
Watch out,
I'm coming to get you!

47
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,125
Nahhh!
[laughs intensely]

48
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,916
[laughs intensely]

49
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,708
Uh, what is that thing?
How did he do that?

50
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,166
[GOTENKS] I'll give
you one warning, Buu!

51
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,458
[BOTH] If you
mess with the ghost,

52
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,541
you'll be toast! Ngh!

[BOTH laugh]

54
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,083
Now let's put his lights out!

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,291
Get ready, ugly!

56
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
'Cause here comes
the beat-down

57

Huh?!

in his weak spot; his stomach!

00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,125
[SUPERGHOST 3] Should we
give him indigestion?

120

[SUPERGHOST 4] And make
him pop like a balloon?

121
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,708
[SUPERGHOST 3]
It'll be easy 'cause he's

Hey, Supreme Kai?
You feel that?

[SUPREME KAI gasps]

126
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:42,000
Majin Buu's energy signal's
completely gone!

Ah! Yes, you're right!

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,041
What does that mean?
Has he died?

129
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:54,125
Well, no. Something
tells me he's still alive.

130
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,125
And the strange thing is,

131
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't sense
the boys' energy either!

132
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
That's because,
they're fighting

133
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,625
in a different time
dimension of course!

134
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,875
[GOKU] A different
time dimension?!

135
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,541
Yes, that's what I said.
Think about it, kid!

00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,958
The Hyperbolic Time Chamber?!

Well gee, I wonder why
they're fighting in there?

138
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
Maybe Majin Buu
barged in on them

139
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,583
while the boys were training.

140
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,208
No, I'm afraid it was the
big green fighter from Namek

141
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,500
who led Majin Buu
into that room.

142
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
But I have no idea why.

Wow, he's good.

145
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,791
And the Old Kai's even
boosted Gohan's power.

146
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,625
You better be careful,
Supreme Kai,

147
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,916
or you could be out of a job!

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,083
Hm!

149
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,833
Truly, you'd think
I hadn't done anything

150

for you and Gohan at all.

Oh nothing--
just a little snack.

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,500
Once they get out of that room
I'm sure they'll be hungry.

155
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,708
I doubt that they'll
have the energy to eat.

156
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,958
[BULMA] Well I
had to do something!

00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,708
I don't know how
you guys can stay so calm.

save the world, they can.

there was still enough
left of him to re-form!

It's my fault.

256
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,375
I thought that
by luring Majin Buu

00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,958
into the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber

258
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,083
it would give you the advantage
you'd need to destroy him!

Yes, of course our friend here

get rid of us if he wants.

Fooled by Gotenks'
childish showmanship,

305

he has trapped Majin Buu,

306
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,166
Gotenks, and himself in this
strange dimension forever!

307
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,416
Could Gotenks' final technique
truly have saved the day?

308
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,041
Will there ever be
a chance to find out?
