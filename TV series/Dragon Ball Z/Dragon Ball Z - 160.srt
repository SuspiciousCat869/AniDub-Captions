on Dragon Ball Z,

Cell had almost
reached his final stage

00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,708
in becoming the Ultimate
Indestructible Android.

4
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,083
And it looked like
Krillin and Android 18

5
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,041
would be no match for
his immense power.

has been absorbed,

and now it looks like Cell
has consumed the final

gain his full potential.

[NARRATOR] Is there any warrior
left who is strong enough

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,291
to challenge the
superiority of Cell?

17
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:07,291
Or is the entire

00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
Help me! Aaa--!

163
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,291
[GOHAN] Krillin...
I'm so sorry...

164
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,708
[GOKU] Son,
use the pain of loss!

165
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,541
[GOHAN] Dad, you've always
been able to do anything

166
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,083
you set your mind to.

167
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,458
There's never been a
challenge you couldn't meet.

168
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,125
And when the time came,
you were ready.

169
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,291
You became a Super Saiyan!

170
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,583
[GOKU] ...responds to
a need, not a desire!

171
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,166
[GOHAN] But Dad,
I'm not like you...

172
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,083
I-I just don't think
I have what it takes!

173
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,041
[GOKU] Use the pain of loss!

174
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,750
The power comes in response
to a need, not a desire!

175
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
Use the pain of loss!

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,375
[GOKU] No! I have to be strong!

177
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,791
If I can't do this, then
Dad, Krillin, everyone!

178
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,958
I'm going to lose them all!

179
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,083
[GOHAN screams]

180
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,541
[GOHAN yells]

181
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:51,416
[GOKU thinking] Wow. He did it.
My son is a Super Saiyan.

182
00:17:51,500 --> 00:18:03,500
[GOHAN grunting]

183
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,375
So, do you still think
I'm too easy on you?

184
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,750
[GOHAN growling]

185
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,000
Gohan, listen!
You've got to calm down!

186
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,708
Try to focus your energy.

187
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:20,750
[GOHAN growling]

188
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,541
I'm really proud of you, Gohan.

189
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,958
I'm so sorry, it was so hard...

190
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,250
Hey, don't worry about it! Just
catch your breath, all right?

191
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,166
We'll take a little break...

192
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,500
Then what do you say
I give you a haircut?

193
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,666
If it gets any longer I'm
going to lose you under there!

194
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,416
[GOKU laughs]

195
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,916
[BOTH laugh]

196
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,875
[CELL] Hmm...

197
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,458
[VEGETA chuckles]

198
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,625
[VEGETA] So this is the
"Ultimate Android's"

199
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,583
new body, eh? What a joke!

200
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,541
He's even smaller
than he was before!

201
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,250
[KRILLIN growls]

202
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:06,083
[thinking] I can't believe it!
She's gone! She's really gone!

203
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,583
[ANDROID 18 screams]

204
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,541
Krillin, no!

205
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,416
[KRILLIN yells]

206
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,458
[KRILLIN shouting]

207
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,291
[thinking] At last... All that I
have ever imagined is now mine!

208
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,125
I have become what no other
could ever achieve...

209
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,250
I am perfect!

210
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:57,291
[shouting continues]

211
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,916
[VEGETA chuckles]

212
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,583
[TRUNKS growls]

213
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,291
Yes, that's right, children.
Have your fun.

214
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,375
[KRILLIN yells]

215
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,833
You monster!

216
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,208
Chew on this!

217
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,625
[KRILLIN yells]

218
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,458
Destructo Disk!

219
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:33,791
[KRILLIN laughs]

220
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,666
Yes! Direct hit!

221
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,125
Huh?!

222
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,416
[TRUNKS gasps]

223
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,416
[CELL] So you want to play, huh?

224
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:02,666
[CELL] Very well. It's
my turn. Are you ready?

225
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,166
[CELL chuckles]

226
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,875

[TRUNKS gasps]

231
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,125
[NARRATOR] Cold this the
beginning of the end?

232
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,750
Is there no stopping
the all-powerful Cell?

233
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,500
There's only one
way to find out...
