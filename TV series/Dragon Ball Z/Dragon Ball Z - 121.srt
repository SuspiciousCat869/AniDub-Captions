00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:20,000
two unwelcome guests, Frieza
and his father, King Cold,

3
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,791
descended upon the Earth,
only to be confronted by

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,083
a mysterious stranger,

5
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,041
a young man determined to thwart

6
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,875
their evil plans
single-handedly.

7
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,750
[NARRATOR] And when the
strange young man vanquished

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,750
Frieza's entire crew in a flash,

9
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,166
his bold purpose seemed
a little more plausible.

10
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,208
You're about to find out
what it's like to fight

11
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,541
a real Super Saiyan!

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,791
And I'm not talking about Goku!

13
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,833
What?!

14
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,250
[yelling]

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,916
No!

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] And so the battle
between the unknown

17
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:02,291
Super Saiyan and Frieza,
the Warlord of Evil, began!

18
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] After a blazing
attack at point blank range,

19
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,416
Frieza's father, the
wicked giant, King Cold,

20
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,750
was convinced that the
battle was already over.

21
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,666
When in fact, it had just begun.

22
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,083
Hey! Frieza!

23
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,541
Huh?!

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,958
[NARRATOR] Who is this
radical Super Saiyan?

25
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,708
And where did he come from?

26
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,541
FInd out today!

27
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,375
[FRIEZA gasps]

28
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,666
[grunting]

29
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,791
[KING COLD] Frieza!

30
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,375
[KING COLD wails]

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,125
They're right there! Look guys!

32
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,583
Huh?

33
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,791

[KING COLD growls]

36
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,833
He... beat Frieza!

37
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:42,958
Effortlessly!

38
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,375
But who is he?

39
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,500
Who knows?!

40
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,875
Let's just hope this
guy's on our side!

41
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,375
[BULMA] You guys are crazy!

42
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,958
They just look like tiny
little dots way up there!

43
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,916
How can you even
tell who they are?

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,041
It's probably Goku, you guys.

45
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,000
Mister Super Saiyan.

46
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,958
He has a knack for showing
up at just the right time...

47
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,750
Yeah! He's such a stud! Gosh!

48
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,250
No, it's not Goku. No way.

49
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,416
--Huh?
--Huh?

50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,375
But he's definitely
a Super Saiyan!

51
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,041
[VEGETA growls]

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,541
Wha--?!

53
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,708
See ya!

54
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,041
Wait up!

55
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,416
Man! Can't miss this!

56
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,833
Hold it, buddy-boy! I'm not
being left behind again!

57
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,916
Oh, wow!

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,500
[BULMA laughs]

59
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,791
This is great!

00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,500
[BULMA laughs]

61
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,916
[YAMCHA] Hold still!

62
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,208
[KING COLD growls]

63
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,041
Super Saiyan.

64
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,041
I'm impressed.

65
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,416
To encounter a fighter
of your caliber

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,875
is a rare occurrence indeed.

67
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:12,083
But it does present
quite an opportunity.

68
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:16,041
You see, I can appreciate
a great talent such as yours.

69
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,625
My eyes are not blinded
by pride like my son's were.

70
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,125
Join me, and take Frieza's
place at my side

71
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,000
as the supreme ruler
of the universe!

72
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,375
Not a chance!

73
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,875
Now don't be too hasty...

74
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,500
Imagine:

75
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,583
This and every other world would
be but the merest of baubles

76
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,291
in your collection.

77
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,750
Play things for your amusement.

78
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,500
Subject to your every whim.

79
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,916
No?

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,500
Alright. But grant me this.

81
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,916
Allow me to examine your sword.

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,583
A weapon of such obvious quality
practically begs to be admired.

83
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,541
[KING COLD chuckles]

84
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,250
[KING COLD] You have
nothing to fear from me.

85
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,708
Hmm?

86
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,958
[BOY] So you want
to see my sword, huh?

87
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,166
Here! Catch!

88
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,166
[KING COLD chuckles]

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,791
[KING COLD] Yes...

90
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:38,791
Yes, indeed.
Remarkable craftsmanship.

91
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,541
And I have a hunch that you
would not have defeated my son,

92
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,208
were it not for this sword.

93
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,250
What do you say?

94
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,708
Believe what you want to.

95
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,250
Hah!

Alright then, I will!

98
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,958
[KING COLD] I say that without
this sword you're nothing!

99
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,916
That's what I believe!

was evil, but not I!

about my father?!

he is, but he's no Super Saiyan!

and I are the only Saiyans left!

worry, I won't bite! This way!

Yeah, possibly! But how?
We've known Goku his whole life.

I'm in! He seems
pretty cool to me.

149
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:18,833
Plus he saved us from Frieza.
He can't be all that bad, huh?

150
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,791
I say we go.

Well, I don't trust
that guy. No way.

You don't trust
me either. I say go.

to find out who he is.

for two more hours.

Well, I don't see why not.

166
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,041
Huh?

167
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,541
Yeah!

168
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,750
Wait! Gohan!

169
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,916
[BULMA] Chill out, Krillin!

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,375
They're just sodas.

171
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,500
[GOHAN] Ooh, wow!
What a great selection!

172
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,958
[BULMA] Hey! I'm starting to
like this guy! He has root beer!

173
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,333
[GOHAN] Orange for me!

174
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,875
Ahh! Good stuff!

175
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,541
Yeah! Super!

176
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,708
Is there a grape, guys?

177
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,166
[GOHAN] Ha, ha!
Yeah! Two grapes!

178
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,208
Oh boy!

179
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,666
Yeah!

180
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,916
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laugh]

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
[BULMA] Have we met?
You look so familiar!

182
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,791
Uh, no. Sorry...

183
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,791
Excuse me, mister! But
how do you know my Dad?

184
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,166
Actually, I haven't
met your dad before.

185
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,416
I've only just heard about him.

186
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,708
[KRILLIN] Then how do you
know that he's going to arrive

187
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,666
at this spot
in two hours?

188
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, that's uh...
Sorry, I... I can't say.

189
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,083
Why not? I'll tell you!
Because you're up to something!

190
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,875
Tell us now, tough guy!
Who are you?

191
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,708
I wish I could. Sorry...

192
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,833
[GOHAN] When you defeated
Frieza and that big guy,

193
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,625
you were a Super Saiyan,
weren't you?

194
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,958
Yes... yes I was.

195
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,041
That's a lie!

196
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,458
--Huh?
--Huh?

197
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,666
[VEGETA] Look my friend,
Kakarot, the one you call Goku,

198
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,041
and myself, are the
only Saiyans left!

199
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,291
Kakarot's kid there is half
Saiyan, so if you count him,

200
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,791
that makes three of us!

201
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,541
There's no way that you
could have Saiyan blood!

202
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,625
Huh?

203
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,833
Uh?

204
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,333
[GOHAN] Yeah, but.. we saw him!
He just defeated Frieza!

205
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,041
And that huge guy!
All by himself!

206
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,458
Well, I'm calling him
a liar! Not a weakling!

207
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,916
Huh?

208
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,458
Oh, hey! You've got our
logo on your jacket.

209
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,291
That's my Dad's company!
Are you one of our employees?

210
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,083
No! Not exactly. Just a fan.

211
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,875
Oh, I see! Well,
tell me your name,

212
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,208
and I'll recommend you to Dad!

213
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:20,166
I, uh, can't do that...
I'm sorry, I know it's strange.

214
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,666
Ooh! Mystery man!

215
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,916
Is his shoe size a secret too?

216
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,666
Yeah! Why can't I
have a secret name?

217
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,083
That's not fair! I bet you have
a secret spy decoder ring too!

218
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,083
Knock it off, you guys!
You're all jealous!

219
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,166
This guy just beat Frieza
single handedly! So there!

220
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,375
Right!

221
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,875
Hah.

222
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,125
[OX-KING] Hey, Hello!

223
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,750
[OX-KING gasps]

224
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,750
Hey, ChiChi!

225
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,583
What is all that junk?

226
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,041
It's the latest
in study equipment.

227
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,541
It teaches kids while
they're sleeping.

228
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,791
[OX-KING] What?

229
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,083
Since I can't get Gohan
to study during the day,

230
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,458
I'll just cram it
into his brain at night!

231
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,916
Oh, yes! He'll be tired
when he gets home.

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,333
So we'll start him off
with a little math.

233
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,541
What makes him think he
can just fly off like that

234
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,416
without saying a word?!

235
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,875
It's that TV!

236
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,333
--I'm throwing the TV away!
--ChiChi! No!

237
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,000
[VEGETA] What are
you looking at?!

238
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,875
[BOY] Oh, uh, nothing. It's just
that I, uh, like your shirt.

239
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,416
[VEGETA] You would.

240
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,291
[GOHAN] Hey,
Piccolo, do you mind

241
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,291
if I ask you about something?

242
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,833
What's that?

243
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,666
Well, uh... When Dende
and the other Nameks

244
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,708
left to resettle
on that new planet

245
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,416
you could've gone with them.

246
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,333
I was wondering why you
chose to stay here with us?

247
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,083
They're your people.

248
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, I might join them
some day. But for now,

249
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,708
I feel like my mission
is here on Earth.

250
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,458
Sometimes connections
between people run deeper

251
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,166
than where they're from or
what color skin they have.

252
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,041
Hey! Now check this out!

253
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,958
Is it me? Or do those
two kind of look alike?

254
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,458
Well, now that you mention it,
I can kind of see a resemblance.

255
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,333
Well.. I mean just in looks.

256
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,166
That other guy
seems pretty nice.

257
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,208
But Vegeta has the
personality of a stump.

258
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,750
Well, he's a prince.

259
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,208
So what?

260
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,041
Princes have to act bored.

261
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,625
Like the world's not
good enough for them.

262
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,166
Huh? Vegeta seems more
agitated than bored.

263
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,791
Like he's got a bad case of
hemorrhoids or something.

264
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,000
[VEGETA] Why do you
keep looking over here?!

265
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,041
Haven't you ever seen
a pink shirt before?!

266
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,458
If you like it that much,
you can have it!

267
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,583
No, no thank you.

268
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,333
Then knock it off, kid!

269
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,916
Maybe Goku met
this guy somewhere

270
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,083
out in space, Chiaotzu.

271
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,208
He has been gone a while.

272
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,416
But he told Gohan that
he hasn't met Goku.

273
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,458
[TIEN] But how can
he know the exact spot

274
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:35,750
that Goku is going to land
two hours before he arrives?

275
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,416
[YAMCHA] Maybe he's wrong!
Maybe Goku's not coming!

276
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,875
[ALL] Huh?

277
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,666
[BULMA] Well, the
only way to find out

278
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,416
is to wait two hours, right?

279
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,541
--[YAMCHA] Yeah!
--[PUAR] Uh-huh!

280
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,958
[BULMA] Well, how
long has it been?

281
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,416
[YAMCHA] One hour.

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,416
[BULMA} Well, then, just
chill out for one more hour!

283
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,708
[YAMCHA] Well, you can
find another ride home!

284
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,541
[BULMA] Fine!

285
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,291
Oops! Uh, sorry!

286
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,041
[BOY] Hey, uh, that's it!
Two hours have passed!

287
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,541
Goku should be arriving
any second now!

288
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,208
--[KRILLIN] Huh?
--[BULMA] Really?

289
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,125
Okay...?

290
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:46,833
Huh...?

291
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:47,750
Huh?!

292
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,166
[CHIAOTZU] Oh, my gosh! Tien!

293
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,375
I know! I feel it too, Chiaotzu!

294
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,750
He's coming!

295
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,833
Man, that guy was
right after all!

296
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,125
You're all nuts!

297
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,541
My woman's intuition
isn't picking up anything

298
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,458
at all right now.

299
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,000
No, it's true!
He's finally home!

300
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,291
My Dad's back!

301
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,041
[GOHAN laughs]

302
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,833
[GOHAN] Look! Up there! Dad!

303
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,541
[BULMA] Wow! Cool!

304
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,625
[KRILLIN] Last one
there is a rotten egg!

305
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,875
[BULMA] Hey! Wait for me!

306
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,458
[BULMA} Wait up!

307
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,583
[GOHAN] Wow! Check it out!
What a crater!

308
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,250
[KRILLIN] Yeah, no kidding!
Boom! What a landing!

309
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,041
I hope he has some
air bags in that baby!

310
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,750
[YAMCHA] Why? To protect
the ship from Goku's head?

311
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,333
[TIEN] Yeah, really!

312
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,833
[gasping]

313
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,291
[GOHAN gasps]

314
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,666
Huh...? Hey, guys.

315
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,708
--[BULMA] Yeah! You made it!
--[cheering, whooping]

316
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,583
--What took you so long, Dad?!
--[cheering, whooping]

317
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,625
[cheering, whooping]

318
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,000
--Goku!
--[cheering, whooping]

319
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,291
Welcome back to Earth, Goku!
--[cheering, whooping]

320
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,083
How did you guys know
