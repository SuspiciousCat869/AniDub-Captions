[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:20,041
Babidi set into motion another
one of his sinister schemes.

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,416
The wizard's plan:

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,125
to draw Piccolo, Trunks,
and Goten out of hiding

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,250
and feed him to the
monster Majin Buu.

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,541
But to draw them out,
he would first need some bait.

7
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:39,916
[PEOPLE gasping, screaming]

00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,416
[BUU]
Aaahh...

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,875
Buu want candy!

10
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,333
[NARRATOR]
At Babidi's command,

11
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,458
Majin Buu used his power to
turn the unsuspecting citizens

12
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,208
of an entire city into candy.

13
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,208
Then, like a
vile vacuum cleaner,

14
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,000
he devoured the population
in a single gruesome gulp.

15
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,750
[NARRATOR]
How much more of this horror

16
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,291
can our heroes bear to witness

17
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,208
before they are
forced out of hiding?

18
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,875
And how many more victims
will Buu have to devour

19
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,541
before he satisfies
his evil appetite?

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,916
You'll have to
watch to find out!

[BABIDI]
Please be courteous

22
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,541
and remember that
silence is golden, okay?

23
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,125
[BABIDI] Aww,
look at that. What a shame.

24
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:01,208
This city is completely useless
if there are no people in it.

Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

Let's fix that! All these old
buildings are spoiling my view.

27
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Go ahead, Majin Buu.
Clean up this town.

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,625
Just don't overdo it.

29
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,125
We wouldn't want the whole
planet to disappear!

Ooh!

Darn it, he's made
his point already.

34

Now he's just rubbing
it in our faces.

That's more like it.

It's what I'll do to
those three meddlers, too.

42
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,208
So one last reminder.

43
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,791
It's him...

There's really no point
in protecting them.

They are not your friends.

They are spineless cowards!

If they valued
your lives at all,

50
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,416
they would have already
turned themselves over to me.

Obviously, they don't.
Well, shame on them, I say!

You now have an
opportunity to teach

53

these selfish brats a lesson.

54

One chance to stand up
for your self-worth

By the way...

You have five days to
measure the importance

of your meager, little lives.

all here on the list!

00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,125
Darn! Dumb kid
sleeps like a rock.

160
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,583
I know! Hey, Goten.
Get up, it's time to eat!

161

--[TRUNKS chuckles]
--[gasps]

162
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,958
Yeah! Let's eat!

163
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,291
Huh? Huh? Food?

164
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
[TRUNKS]
Why do you even have ears?

165
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,166
You hear much better
with your stomach.

166
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,208
Huh? What did you say?
Where is this?

167
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,750
Uh... I don't know? You tell me.

168
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,541
[GOTEN]
I don't know. It's sure nice!

169
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Oh, hey! That plate
looks expensive!

170
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,333
Who cares about that? I want
to know what we're doing here.

171
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
[gasps] Where's my dad?

172
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
Oh yeah! We were with him.

173
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,333
That's right!

174
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,250
[VEGETA] Trunks. There's
something you must know.

175
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,958
You've made me proud, my son.

176
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
[TRUNKS grunts]

177
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,791
What did you do to him?!

178
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Why did you do it?! Tell me!

179
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,375
Why did you do that to Trunks?!

180
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,958
[GOTEN grunts]

181
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,416
So then, he... isn't here?

182
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,041
But I... I think we should
check this place out.

183
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,500
[GOTEN]
Mm-hmm.

184
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,625
[TRUNKS]
This place is huge!

185
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,583
It looks like
there's nobody home!

186
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,916
Hey, hold on?
Where have those boys gone?

187
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,291
Kibito, revive
Gohan with your power.

188
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,041
[gasps]

189
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,708
Whoa! What the...?

190
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:08,166
[GOHAN]
Supreme Kai? Where... are we?

191
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,166
It's my world.
It's the World of the Kais.

192
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,708
This is where you live?

193
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,416
Well I, uh, guess this
means I'm dead, doesn't it?

194
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,666
Hey, I don't get a
halo like my dad has?

195
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,458
No. Now don't worry.

196
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,166
You were in bad shape,
but you're alive.

197
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,250
'Kay... But if I'm not dead,
then what am I doing here?

198
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,541
You are asking too many
questions of the Supreme Kai!

199
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,708
You should try to
be more respectful.

200
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,000
You are a guest here.

201
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,833
No living mortal has
ever stood on this ground.

202
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,041
Oh! So then I
really did die, I guess?

203
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,208
And that's why I'm here?

204
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,083
Huh? Gohan, you're alive!

205
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,250
But I don't know why you are
here. It is very strange.

206
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,541
It is very strange indeed!

207
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,208
[GOHAN] Then what's wrong
with asking a few questions?

208
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,000
Supreme Kai, what's going on?

209
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
[KIBITO]
I am also puzzled, Master.

210
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,958
It's not right! Gohan does not
belong in a place like this!

211
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,500
I brought Gohan here
to get the Z sword!

212
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,875
It's the only way that
Majin Buu can be defeated now.

213
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,958
[gasps] The Z sword?!

214
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,125
You-You can't be
serious, Supreme Kai?!

215
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,000
How can a mere Earthling do what
the Kais themselves could not?!

216
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,791
Don't you remember?!

217
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,166
None of the Kais, not even you,

218
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,083
were capable of
freeing the Z sword!

219
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,208
I'm aware of the
power of the Z sword.

220
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,291
And I'm certain that Gohan is
the right person to wield it.

221
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,166
Uh? What's the Z Sword?

222
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,500
Master! Please! Have you
really thought this through?!

223
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
There's no harm
in trying, Kibito!

224
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
Let's go! Gohan! Come with me!

225
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,916
[GOHAN] Wait, aren't you going
to tell me what the Z sword is?

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,375
Guess not...

227
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,791
He won't pull the Z sword from
that rock! I guarantee it!

228
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,208
[GOTEN]
This is really good, Trunks!

229
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:26,125
Where are they? Piccolo,
your dad, where are they?

230
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:30,833
Goten, don't you know it's rude
to talk with your mouth full?

231
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,166
Your manners are really bad.
You shouldn't talk,

232
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,375
when you're eating.

233
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,333
I'm sorry...

234
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
Ah, that's okay.

Huh?

00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
Well, I see you found the food.

We didn't do anything wrong!

I-It was just sitting here!

240
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,708
If you wanted it so bad, you
should have got here first!

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Hey! Hands off, buddy!
Goten, what are you doing?!

242
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,833
This is no time to be
stuffing your face!

243
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,541
Hold on, Trunks. Please be
quiet till I finish my meal.

[growls, screams]

245
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,416
[GOTEN] You were the one that
said it was bad manners

246
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,250
to talk when a person
was eating, remember?

247
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,750
If you want to see bad manners,
then you've got it!

248

My, even Goku wasn't that
powerful when he was a boy!

have a lot of energy, Goku!

263

Well! I guess I'll have to get
them to work it off, won't I?

264
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,833
By teaching them
the fusion technique!

Hmm?

What a view!
You know, in a lot of ways

267
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,583
this reminds me of
where I live back on Earth!

Those clothes suit
you well, Gohan.

Ya think so? Thanks!

Uh?

00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,125
[SUPREME KAI]
This is the Z sword, Gohan.

278
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,958
Now try to pull it out.

279
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,541
No one else has done it.

280
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,500
Gohan, if you can pull it from
the rock, you will be the first.

[GOHAN]
Whoa... The first one, huh?

282

You know, this
might sound strange,

283
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,458
but I feel like
I've done this before.

[TRUNKS]
What?! No, that can't be!

happen to my dad!

Stop that! We don't
have time for this now!

[GOKU]
I know that might seem harsh,

295
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,125
but there's a chance Babidi
could find this place!

296

So I want both of you to
start practicing right away!

297
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,666
What about the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber?

298
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,958
No, that room can only be
used twice in a lifetime.

299

I'm sure in the future we're
going to have to use it again.

We'll be just fine.
