[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,666
Piccolo and Nail
have become one,

3
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,291
and at first it seemed like they
stood a chance against Frieza.

4
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,625
But since his transformation,
Frieza has become unstoppable.

5
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,458
[FRIEZA] Now you'll
see I wasn't bluffing

6
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,291
because I'll be transforming
before your very eyes.

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,666
Watch carefully, now.

8
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,541
And keep in mind it's
not my ultimate form.

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,833
I still have one more
transformation!

10
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,875
You're full of it.

11
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,750
So, are you ready to get
this over with or what?

12
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,208
Yaah!

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
[NARRATOR] After his
transformation,

14
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,666
Frieza's superior speed
and strength have rendered

15
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,000
Piccolo totally powerless
and in dire straits!

16
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,458
[NARRATOR} Can Gohan save
Piccolo from certain death?

17
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,333
Find out today!

[FRIEZA] Hmm...?

22
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,125
[GOHAN] Haah!

23
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,291
[GOHAN] Masenkooo...

24
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,458
Haaa!

00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,625
I've had enough
of you, Friezaaa!

[GOHAN grunts]

00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
[KRILLIN] Just a little
further, Gohan!

45
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,958
[FRIEZA yells]

46
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,083
[GOHAN gasps]

47
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,916
[PICCOLO grunts]

48
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,875
I guess I owe you, Piccolo.

49
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,625
[thinking] Phew. That was close.

50
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:39,375
[FRIEZA] Strange! Where did the
little one get all his power?

51
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,125
[FRIEZA] That kid's stronger
than any Saiyan

52
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,583
I've ever fought.

53
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,958
I better keep my
eye on that one.

54
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:56,458
I wonder who he is? I'm sure
I eliminated all the Saiyans

55
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,583
except for Vegeta, Nappa, and
Raditz twenty years ago!

56
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,750
How'd he survive?

57
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,500
Neither one of those misfits
could possibly be his father.

58
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,250
[FRIEZA] No matter.

59
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,916
In the end they all must
be expunged anyway.

60
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,041
I can't believe
Frieza survived that.

61
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:32,500
But boy, that Gohan...
What a pistol.

62
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,500
[GOHAN thinking] Oh no!
I think that last attack

63
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,666
used up all my power!
Now what am I going to do?

64
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,291
[VEGETA thinking]
What I'd like to know

65
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,041
is how did that kid
become so powerful?!

66
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,291
[VEGETA] Hey, Cueball!

67
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,625
Huh?

68
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,291
[VEGETA] Listen up
and listen good,

69
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,416
'cause I'm only going
to say this once!

70
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,625
The only way we can beat Frieza

71
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,458
is for you to whip me to
within an inch of my life!

72
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,041
Because, as you've just
witnessed,

73
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,708
a Saiyan's power grows
stonger after recovering

74
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,708
from serious injuries.
I need to be stronger!

75
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,916
Understand me?!

76
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,750
Y-Yeah.

77
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,833
[VEGETA] Good!

78
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:20,291
The time is now. I must crush
these miserable Saiyans.

79
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,583
Because they're
like pesky insects.

80
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,125
Once you let them
get a foothold,

81
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,791
they can be hard to wipe out.
Best eliminate them now,

82
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,583
before they gain momentum.

83
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,583
Well, what are you
waiting for, huh?!

84
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,041
Punch me! Cut a hole in me!

85
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,958
'Cause if you don't,
we are doomed!

86
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,958
B-but I could hurt you...
if I beat you up too much!

87
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,875
Very unlikely. Let's get
the show on the road, shall we?

88
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,416
Now, according to my plan,

89
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,291
once that Namekian gnome down
there sees I'm nearly toast,

90
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,833
he has no choice
but to heal me, right?

91
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,916
[KRILLIN growls]

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Even though I can't stand
your guts, I can't do it!

93
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,500
Why, you...!

94
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,458
Besides, after what I just
saw Gohan do, who needs you?!

95
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,916
[VEGETA] Give me a break!

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,875
After that attack, the kid
doesn't have any power left!

97
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,333
[FRIEZA laughs]

98
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,875
Pardon me,

99
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,083
I hate to interrupt a spirited
conversation such as yours,

100
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,125
but I am running on a bit of a
tight schedule. So, to be fair,

101
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,375
I'll even give you the choice
of which one of you

102
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,333
will be my first victim!

103
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,166
I, uh, i think he's
talking to us, Vegeta!

104
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,500
No! I'm not ready!

105
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,041
[FRIEZA] My dear, dear friend,

106
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:41,541
who is ever ready to meet
their final fate? Hmm?

107
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:46,208
Now feast your eyes on my
ultimate transformation!

It's... incredible.

112
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,833
Now what do we do?

113
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,125
[VEGETA] C'mon, c'mon! We
can still do it if we hurry!

114
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,000
C'mon!

115
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,625

Ahh, it's all over. Doomed
without any mascara on...

Oh, why did I even come to this
stupid planet to look for those

stupid Dragon Balls anyway?!

127

Nobody cares if I exist!

Stupid Krillin! Stupid
Gohan! Stupid Goku!

129

I hate you! I hate you all!

Oh, I think I broke a nail...

[thinking] I can feel
Frieza's power growing!

it's now or never?!

You've gotta do
better than that!

141
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,916
Now try again!

142
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Ah, humans! You are pathetic!

143
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,583

fight better than you!

you do that for, Krillin?!

He's a Namek with a

to fix you right up!

163
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,791
C'mon! There's no time to waste!

164
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,291
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

165
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,333
Krillin! We gotta find Dende!

166
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,583
[DENDE whimpers]

167
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,375
[VEGETA] C-C'mere kid!
You gotta help me...

168
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,250
If you know what's good for you,
you will. You understand?

169
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,916
[DENDE] But I can't help you!

170
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,291
What are you saying?
I know you can help!

171
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,291
I've seen you heal
other people!

172
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,125
[DENDE] I can only heal
those who have a good heart.

173
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,916
You! Your heart is black
from the people you've hurt.

174
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,916
Why, you little...! Unless
you heal me, you little brat,

175
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,666
Frieza's going to
wipe us all out!

176
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,041
Sorry, I can't!

177
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:21,958
[FRIEZA yells]

178
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,875
Hey, c'mon...

179
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,708
I don't have time for your
stupid moral dilemma, kid.

180
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,291
Alright! I-I'll try.

181
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,916
I'm sorry, I can't do it!

182
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
[VEGETA] You'll pay for this!

183
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,416
Game... over...

184
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,416
[KRILLIN] So then, Vegeta
told me to beat him up

185
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
because he said if I did,

186
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,875
he'd get Dende to heal him and
turn him into a Super Saiyan!

187
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,208
[GOHAN] Oh!

188
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,375
Well, I did it, figuring
once he was a Super Saiyan,

189
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,625
he'd take on Frieza and
whip his sorry butt!

190
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,458
[GOHAN] Really?!

191
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,791
[KRILLIN] Huh?

192
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,625
--It's Dende!
--Dende?

193
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,541
Look!

194
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,000
It's Vegeta!

195
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,375
[FRIEZA yells]

196
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:36,333
So, I hear... you... have the...
power to heal. Can you heal me?

197
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,791
[DENDE] I'll try...

198
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,125
[FRIEZA growls]

199
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,625
[laughing]

200
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,666
[growling continues]

201
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,500
[growling continues]

202
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

203
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,333
[PICCOLO Well, everything
looks back to normal.

204
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,875
Thanks kid, I owe ya.

205
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, I didn't do it
to help you out, sir.

206
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,041
I did it to help Nail.

207
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:32,541
Dende, listen. The only way to
beat Frieza is to heal Vegeta.

208
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,583
You gotta understand
it's our only hope.

209
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,416
[DENDE] I... I can't.

210
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,875
[BOTH] Huh?

211
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,458
He's just like Frieza!

212
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,333
I can't help someone who
destroyed my people!

213
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,916
[NAIL] Sorry, kid, but I have
to agree with your friends.

214
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,250
[DENDE gasps]

215
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,458
[NAIL] All of us combined
are no match for Frieza,

216
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,958
so we need Vegeta.
There's no other way!

217
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,708
[FRIEZA groans]

218
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:15,333
[FRIEZA yells]

219
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,583
It's.. It's Frieza!
What are we gonna do?!

220
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,666
He must be finished
transforming!

221
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,958
[KRILLIN] Uh, guys? I say we
get outta here while we can.

222
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,875
At least until
Goku's up to speed!

223
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:38,166
[PICCOLO] If we do that, Frieza
will destroy this entire planet,

224
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,625
including Goku!

225
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,750
I know Frieza has no regard
for anyone or anything.

226
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:00,083
In my wildest dreams I've never
seen anything so... powerful.

227
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,125
I wonder what "it"
will look like...

228
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,958
I'll bet it's the most hideous,
ugly, repulsive creature

229
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,041
in the universe.

230
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,375
Please, Dende.

231
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,250
You have to forget about
the past and heal Vegeta.

232
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,625
[DENDE whimpers]

233
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,958
Thanks, Dende.

234
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,083
[PICCOLO] I can see him!

235
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,916
[VEGETA grunts]

236
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,666
Oh, by the way...

237
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,125
Thanks!

238
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,041
Hey, punk! You're just lucky
you caught me in a good mood!

239
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,125
Ah, at last Frieza
decidees to show himself.

240
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,083
And from here, he doesn't
look so tough anymore!

241
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,916
Well, I guess now that
my power has increased...

242
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,208
It's time to let my
fists do the talking!

243
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,666
[VEGETA chuckles]

244
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,333
[DENDE whimpers]

245
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:42,875
[thinking] Oh no, I can sense
something terrible... Frieza!

246
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,541
[NARRATOR] Now that
Frieza has completed

247
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,166
his final transformation,

248
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,958
the stage is set for
the ultimate showdown.

249
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,833
Find out who will survive

250
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,833
in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
