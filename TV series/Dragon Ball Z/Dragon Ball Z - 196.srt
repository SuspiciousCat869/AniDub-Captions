00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,583
King Kai and Goku hopped a plane
to the planet of the Grand Kai,

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,833
ruler of Other World!

4
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
[NARRATOR] There, hundreds of
dead warriors were gathered,

5
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,500
practicing for centuries on
this eternal training ground.

6
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,958
[GOKU] This place
is a dream come true!

7
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,458
Look at all the fighters.

8
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,375
[NARRATOR] The tour turned
quickly into a shouting match

9
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,291
with the arrival of West Kai,

10
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,625
who was showing off his
prize fighter, Pikkon!

11
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,416
[NARRATOR] But before a
brawl could break out,

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
the quirky Grand Kai appeared.

13
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,666
And he had an important
mission for Pikkon.

14
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,666
[GRAND KAI] Hey!

15
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,875

--[CELL laughs]
--Good odds!

17
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,750
Wouldn't you say, boys?

18
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,583
[GINYU FORCE]
Yeah!

19
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] Down in the Hell,

20
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,625
Cell, Frieza, and the Ginyu
Force were trying to take over.

21
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,916
What a fearsome team!

22
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,458
[NARRATOR] But as Goku
watched in amazement,

23
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,375
the mysterious warrior Pikkon
stopped the villains

24
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,250
with the greatest of ease.

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,208

[FRIEZA gasps]

[FRIEZA grunts]

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,125
[NARRATOR] With fighters as
strong as Pikkon in this world,

30
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,250
it looks like Goku has his
work cut out for him.

31
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,166
[GOKU] You should've
seen it, King Kai!

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,583
Pikkon knocked Cell
out with one blow!

33
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,625
It was wild!

34
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,125
[KING KAI] Ah. Yes.
I'm sure it was...

35
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,000
[GOKU] C'mon, King Kai,
I'm serious!

36
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,458
[KING KAI] Goku, you'll
soon see Pikkon's strength

37
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,916
is not uncommon.

38
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,958
[KING KAI] Knock knock!
Anybody home?

39
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,083
[MAN] Greetings, King Kai!
It is good to see you!

40
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,291
This is our newest
student, Goku!

41
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,833
[ALL] Hello!

42
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,166
Goku, these are warriors
from the North Quadrant.

43
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,083
Keep your ears open and
you'll learn a great deal.

44
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,916
[KING KAI] Migoren here fought
off an army of evil invaders

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,416
about 7,000 years ago.

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Sarte bravely protected his
planet from meteorites

47
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:57,541
3,600 years ago.
And, there's this guy.

48
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,166
Olibu.

49
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,708
He's from Earth like you!

50
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,166
This is the guy who most of your
heroic legends are based on!

51
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,125
As well as a few cartoons.

52
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,166
[KING KAI laughs]

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,625
[KING KAI] And I could go on!

54
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,458
All of them were righteous
martial artists in life.

55
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,041
And here in Other World,
they're all working on their

56
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,708
10,000 years of hard training.

57
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,416
That will earn them
a private lesson

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,750
from the Grand Kai himself.

59
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,250
Huuh?!

60
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,875
Are you telling me that everyone
has to train for that long

61
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,541
before he'll instruct them?!

62
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,375
Well, yeah! You have to show
that you're perfectly qualified

63
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,791
or else you'd just be
wasting the Grand Kai's time.

64
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,750
I guess...

65
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,166
[KING KAI laughs]

66
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,458
Did you think you could
just knock on his door?!

67
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,083
[KING KAI laughs]

68

cannot be!

is really dead!

--We found a halo on his head!
--[KING KAI screams]

72
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,708
And only one thing can be SAID!

Congratulations!

74
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,833

[ALL]
Dead!

76
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,000
Cut it out already! Just exactly
how did they get in on this?!

77
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,791
I called them of course!

78
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,916
You know, none of us have
ever seen a dead Kai before!

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,041
Not ever!

80
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,541
And so now...
we'll have a big party!

81
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,333
Leave me alone!

82
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,333
Who are those people getting
King Kai all worked up?

83
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,791
Those are his counterparts.

84
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,958
The tall one is South Kai...

85
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,000
And she's East Kai...

86
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,791
Wait, now how many of these
Kai's are there again?

87
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,125
Only these...

88
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,958
Well, at least on their level

89
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,708
Think of it as a ladder.

90
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,583
On the bottom rung
is all of space...

91
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,166
Higher up is Hell
and then Snake Way...

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,416
At the next level are
the planet's of the four Kais,

93
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,916
who oversee their
parts of the Universe.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,666
And higher still, above
the four Kais and all the rest

95
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,416
is the Grand Kai's planet.

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,416
Ohh... I see.

97
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,375
And that's where we are right?
Funny, I never knew this

98
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,458
the whole time I was alive!

99
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,125
Well, I never knew there
was anything past the Earth.

100
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,750
There's just no denying it,
you're one dead Kai!

101
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,083
Mind your own business,
you nosy old hag!

00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,750

have been together
in 300 years.

107

So, we should prove which
one of us is better

00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,708

[GOKU laughs]

325
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,958
[KING KAI whimers]

326
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,250
South Quadrant must be a
very peaceful place...

327
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,625
[laughing continues]

328
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,125
--[CATERPY] Yeah! Say give up!
--[GOKU] O-Oh, man!

329
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,791
--It's the only way!
--[GOKU laughs]

330
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,000
--Tickle, tickle!
--No, please--!

331
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:45,291
[GOKU laughs]

332
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,000
[GOKU] I... don't... give up!

333
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,250
[GOKU growls]

334
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,833
[CATERPY grunts]

335
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,125
[CATERPY groans]

336
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,083
Uhh... Gee, guy...

337
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,083
You're not very strong...

338
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,083
You... meanie!

339
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,541
Picking on me like that!

340
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,416
You're...

341
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,333
gonna be sorry!

342
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,041
[GOKU yells]

343
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,875
[CATERPY sobs] He hit me!

344
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,583
But aren't you supposed
to fight in a fight?

345
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,041
[GOKU gasps]

346
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,666
What a development!

347
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,000
Caterpy's begun his
metamorphosis!

348
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:39,041
[FIGHTERS gasp, mumble]

349
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,708
What's... he doing?!

350
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,583
He's become a pupa.

351
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:57,000
In time he will change
into his ultimate form!

352
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,625
Pardon me, South Kai,

353
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,416
but may I just ask you
how much time

354
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,666
this metamorphosis
of his is gonna take?

355
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,000
[SOUTH KAI coughs]

356
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,916
I'd say somewhere in the
neighborhood

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
of about twelve hundred years...

358
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,458
[ALL gasp]

359
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:19,750
Ahh... I don't think I can
wait THAT long to finish this!

360
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,333
Yeah... Well, neither can I.

361
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,333
So Goku wins this
round by default!

362
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:31,750
[FIGHTERS &amp; CROWD cheer]

363
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,833
Guess...

364
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,083
They like me...

365
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,750
[cheering continues]

366
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] And so, the Other
World Tournament has begun...

367
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,833
Can Goku, in his rookie attempt,
punch his way to the final bout?

368
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,708
And what sort of
strange maneuvers

369
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,791
will his next
competitors employ?

370
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:52,125
Stay tuned for more of the
excitement on Dragon Ball Z!
