00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,041
[GARLIC JR.] Ah, in the
darkness they have taken wing,

6
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,333
never to return again...

00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,125
[GARLIC JR.] Maybe these poor
fools know how I felt now.

10
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,916
When I was cast off
against my will into

11
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,125
a place from which
there was no escape.

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,916
[GARLIC JR.] Into the darkness.
Alone, in a frozen hell

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
without any light for years.

14
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
So many years...

15
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,750
Well I've come back to share.

16
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,083
To share the pain and
the horror that I felt

17
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,208
with every living
thing on Earth.

18
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,750
After ten years of exile
in the Dead Zone,

19
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,333
I, Garlic Jr., have
returned to Earth

20
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,291
to hatch a sinister plan of

21
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
destruction and revenge.

Hey, Krillin.

Wow. Is that really
you under there?

33

Yeah, sweetheart. See?

So whatcha been doing, partner?!

37
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,375
Ehh, not much.

[KRILLIN screams]

39
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,833
[GOHAN] It looks like we'll
be having fish for a while.

40
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,958
Hey, do you want to help
me gut and clean 'em?

41
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,375
Uh, no thanks.

Hey, come on.

Hey!

44
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,958
[GOHAN] Let's go for
a swim, then.

45
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,416
The water is ice-cold.
It feels really incredible.

46
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,458
No, please, no.

47
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,833
Huh?

48
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,791
Sorry. It's the threads, bro.

49
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,833
Ahh. Well, no big deal.
Take 'em off.

50
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,000
[KRILLIN] Uh, well, uhh...

51

Huh?

52
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,791
Oh, wow. Check out that car!

53
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,208
Is it yours?! For real?!

54
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
Yep. Well, uh, sort of.

55
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,000
Aw, what the heck.

56
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,166
It's been so long.

57
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,291
One little dip
won't hurt anything.

58

Ha-ha!

Yeah, sure! One sec!

forget about me, did you?

Who me?

Yeah, you. Who's that?

Oh, this is my martial
arts partner, Gohan.

71

Gohan this is
my "friend", Maron.

Hi.

73
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,000
Is he from outer-space?

74
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,083
No, Maron, this isn't the one.

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,000
It's his dad, remember?

76
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,375
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

77
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,958
Well, he sure is cute,
though. Did you know that?

78
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,416
Well, sort of.

And look at this

beautiful black hair.

I know a lot of girls
that would kill

83
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,125
to have hair like this.

84
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,958

out in your underwear?

What?

There's a party, bro.

101
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,250
Later on this afternoon
at Master Roshi's place.

102
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
Think you can make it?

Yeah, sure.

104

Well, that is, if my
mom'll let me go.

and she'll say yes.

I needed glasses.

What? You. And what
are you doing here?

Thanks. Nice welcome.

You're still rude, arrogant,

and completely lacking
in social graces.

here to talk to you.

would ascend to the throne

and take over my position
as guardian of the Earth.

lately, and, I'm not sure,

glimpses of the future.

[MR. POPO] It was an

but when Goku and
Piccolo intervened,

[MR. POPO] He didn't

00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,958
Only a brat like
you would destroy

328
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,291
a beautiful sanctuary like this!

329
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,458
[GARLIC JR.] What business
is it of yours, Kami?

330
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,583
This is my sanctuary now.

331
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,916
[KAMI] Mr. Popo. Can you
hear me. Mr. Popo?

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,041
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

333
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,875
This what you want?

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,708
[MR. POPO] Sorry, Kami!

335
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,208
[GARLIC JR.] As new
guardian of the Earth,

336
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,666
the first change I'm making
is to hire a groundskeeper

337
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,875
who's actually tall enough
to water the plants.

338
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,875
Why, you fiend! You'll
never get away with this!

339
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,458
Your dark plans have no
firm foundation to stand on!

340
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,666
They're going to crumble.
You can't succeed!

341
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
Yes I can.

342
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,250
You were lucky last time.
If it wasn't for that kid,

343
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,875
I'd be sitting on your
throne already.

344
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,500
In your dreams. I'll die
before I let that happen!

345
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,833
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

346
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,666
Oh my, I couldn't have
said it any better myself.

347
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,833
I'm taking over,
and you are going to die!

348
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,291
[GARLIC JR. yells]

349
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,250
[KAMI thinking]
He's too fast to detect!

350
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,125
[KAMI shouts]

351
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916
[blows landing,
KAMI grunts]

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,375
[KAMI yells]

353
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,583
--[WARRIORS yell]
--[KAMI] What the...?

354
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,416
[WARRIORS laugh]

355
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,666
Nice. Good work.

356
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,666
We'll keep him alive
for the time being.

357
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,583
That way we can use
the Dragon Balls.

358
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,583
What? Oh, no!

359
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,000
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

360
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,875
You are a sight to behold.

361
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,666
You have no idea how much
I'm loving this, old man.

362
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,916
Fool! You won't succeed!

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,833
My, my, those are
awfully big words

364
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,333
from such a tiny little man.
You're too much.

365
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,875
Don't you get it, you
feeble, joke of a guardian?

366
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,916
Your time has come.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,875
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

368
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,041
[CHICHI hums]

369
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,208
Gosh, I'm sorry,
Mom. Man, I'm bad.

370
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,083
Thanks. Being bad's not easy.

371
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,750
Well, let's blaze.
What d'ya say?

372
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,500
[growls]

373
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
Shh.

374
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,208
[GOHAN laughs]

375
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,083
Whoa. Look at that
sunset, Icarus!

376
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
[door creaks open]

377
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,916
[GARLIC JR.] Now where would
that green goody-two-shoes

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,083
hide my father's
Black Water Mist?

379
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,583
Hmm? Wouldn't you know it.

380
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,833
That dodo left it
right here in the open.

381
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,833
Ah, yes, this is it, all right.

382
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,458
With this, we don't need
an army. We'll make one.

383
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,416
What d'ya mean, Boss?

384
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,250
[GARLIC JR. grunts]

385
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,708
[GARLIC JR.] When people
breath this mist,

386
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,833
any evil tendencies
that they're resisting

387
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,750
take control of
their character.

388
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,166
They become mad with desire for
wealth and material pleasure

389
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,041
to the point of wanting to
kill each other for it.

390
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,250
You see, boys,
our army of darkness

391
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,291
has always been here.

392
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,708
We just have to wake it up.

393
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,500
You're a genius, Lord Garlic.
What a brilliant plan.

394
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,708
Yeah, you've really outdone
yourself this time, Boss.

395
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,083
Why, thank you.

396
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,458
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

397
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,458
[NARRATOR] With Kami and
Mr. Popo powerless to stop him,

398
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,166
Garlic Jr. has released
the Black Water Mist

399
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,541
onto the Earth.

400
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,541
As Gohan flies unsuspectingly
to meet his friends,

401
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,041
the evil mist descends.

402
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,166
What darkness does it portend?

403
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,916
