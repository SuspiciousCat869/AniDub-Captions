1
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
[GOKU]
Hey, Buu!

3
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,125
I'd like you to
do me a little favor!

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,041
It's not like you to
break the rules, Kakarot!

5
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,208
I know! But I really
want to fight this guy

6
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,458
in the first round!

7
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,625
That way we'll both be
at one hundred percent

8
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,708
and it'll be a
totally fair match!

9
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,291
[NARRATOR]
With a little help from Buu,

10
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,750
Goku had his desire fulfilled!

11
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,958
And he was matched up
with the mystery fighter

12
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,500
in the first round
of the finals!

13
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,833
According to Goku,

14
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,333
the simple village boy
named Uub was, in fact,

15
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,666
a benevolent incarnation
of the evil Majin Buu!

16
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,875
[NARRATOR] But the boy wasn't
aware of his true powers,

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,166
and Goku wasn't beyond
using insult or injury

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,916
to coax them out!

19
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,166
[growls] My mom isn't fat!

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,375
My family's not ugly!

21
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,000
And my father's
not a bed wetter!

22
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,708
[NARRATOR]
And so the battle begins!

23
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:25,166
[yells]

24
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,000
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

25
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,208
[GOTEN]
Whoa!

26
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:36,041
[yells]

27
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,000
Huh?!

28
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,666
[ANNOUNCER]
Oh, my goodness!

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,416
It looks like Goku is out cold!

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,375
One! Two!

31
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,750
No! Wait! He's getting up!

32
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,500
This is really exciting!

33
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,583
There's no doubt about it!
That kid is Majin Buu all right!

34
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,125
[coughs]

35
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,250
[GOKU]
Hey! The fight's up here!

36
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,833
Huh?

37
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,458
Ha ha!

38
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,916
[UUB thinking]
I can't lose!

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,916
I promised everyone that
I'd return with the prize money!

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,458
I have to win!

41
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,083
Very good, but you
can do much better!

42
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,750
Whoa! Feel the power
of those blows!

43
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,500
They could stop
a train in its tracks!

44
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,583
Are you watching this?

45
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,291
I don't believe it!

46
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,541
The kid is actually learning how
to fight while he's fighting!

47
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,125
[GOKU]
Huh?

48
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,375
[KRILLIN] Are you guys
seeing what I'm seeing?

49
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,208
Oh, man unreal!

50
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,833
Yes! I see! He's great!

51
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,166
But that's your Dad!

52
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,416
Yeah! How can a boy
fight with Goku like that?

53
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,625
[BULMA]
This must be the guy!

54
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,416
The one that Goku
was talking about!

55
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,250
Is that possible?
Could a boy be that strong?

56
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,375
[VIDEL]
Huh?

57
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,208
This is great! What a fight!

58
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,416
Heck yeah!

59
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,166
[MR. SATAN yawns]
I think I'm gonna go take a nap.

60
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,875
A nap? You no watch fight?

61
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,250
Uh! Who cares!
Goku's going to win!

62
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,958
Then, he'll go to the finals
and face the great Majin Buu!

63
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,666
And after that, the
reigning champ, that'd be me,

64
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,833
is going to step in

65
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,875
and beat the winner
in the title fight!

66
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,708
I see!

67
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,583
Now what? How come when I...

68
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,833
What? What's this?

69
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,666
[Announcer] This is amazing!

70
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,916
Goku and Uub are perfectly
on par with one another!

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,833
Neither of them
is budging an inch!

72
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,833
[ANNOUNCER]
Wow!

73
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,833
That's four solid feet
of concrete giving way

74
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,666
under the sheer
magnitude of this fight!

75
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,916
Huh?! Oh, no! They'll
demolish the place!

76
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,791
[DENDE] Oh, he's giving
Goku a run for his money!

77
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:56,291
Mm! Indeed he is Dende.
And Goku must be loving it!

78
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,708
He's waited ten years for this!

79
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,916
Whoa! Now I've seen it all!

80
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,458
Goku is being swung
around by a boy half his size!

81
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,083
Your words are venom!

82
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,708
--[PAN] Grandpa!
--[MR. SATAN] No, no!

83
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,125
Please! Don't be hurt!

84
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,666
Goku!

85
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,291
Goku!

86
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,833
No, he's gone!

87
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,291
Wow! Folks! This
could be a knock out!

88
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,458
Man! That little dude rocks!

89
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,541
Go get him!

90
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:47,541
[ANNOUNCER] Incredible! Goku
hardly has a scratch on him!

91
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,208
Pretty good try!

92
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,875
Ahhh! Let's go!

93
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,375
[cheering]

94
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,416
[gulps]

95
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,083
[KNOCK] What are these bad boys,
Captain? Some kind of mutants?

96
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,208
Well, I don't rightly know.

97
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,666
[KNOCK] I say we get the heck
out of here while we still can!

98
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,125
Yes?

99
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,208
[ATTENDENT] Hey, you two!
Wait a second!

100
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,875
[ATTENDENT] You guys are
finalists, aren't you?

101
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,250
My manager says you're not
supposed to leave the building!

102
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:55,458
Yeah! Well, I've
gotta go! Big number two!

103
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,583
Wait! What's this?

104
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,500
My Chicken Senses
are vibrating!

105
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,041
Yes! It's coming
in clear now!

106
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,166
There's a little
girl in distress!

107
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,583
B-Buck, bawk! Buck,
bawk! Buck, bawk!

108
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,041
Wings! Gizzard! Thigh!
The bad guy's gonna cry!

109
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,916
Captain Chicken away!

110
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,916
If he didn't want to fight, he
should have just said so! Geez!

111
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,333
[ANNOUNCER] Excellent! Young
Uub is still in the match!

112
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:02,291
[UUB thinking] I can't lose! I
gave them my word! All of them!

113
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,833
[UUB thinking] My family!
The elders! The children!

114
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,166
I promised them all!

115
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,166
Hmm?

116
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,500
I won't lose!

117
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,291
Whoa...

118
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,166
[MAN IN CROWD]
Wha...?!

119
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,125
Whoa! That's just not possible!

120
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,791
Ah! You can fly?

121
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,291
Ka... me...

122
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,750
...ha... me...

123
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,458
Dad! Don't do it!

124
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,875
Hello! I take it you don't
know quite how to fly yet, Uub.

125
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,666
Well, that's too bad!
It's only natural you know!

126
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,666
You need to find a Master
who can teach you these things!

127
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,125
I apologize for insulting
you earlier! Please forgive me!

128
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,166
Huh?

129
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,666
I just wanted to
see your true power.

130
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,750
It was all bottled up
inside until I made you mad!

131
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,583
But, hey! Look at you,

132
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,875
I think you learned
something about yourself!

133
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,458
You're strong! Real strong!

134
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,666
[GOKU] However,
you don't quite know how

135
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,291
to control your power yet.

136
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,708
I'll bet you've never fought
like this before, have you?

137
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,375
[UUB]
No! Not really!

138
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,041
Yeah! I see! Hmm?

139
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,791
Okay! Why not?

140
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,041
I've decided that from
now on I'm going to live

141
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,333
in your village and teach
you the art of fighting!

142
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,750
How does that sound?

143
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,375
You'll get a lot stronger!
Well? Whatd'ya say?

144
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,041
Why yes! Of course!

145
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,166
Oh, but...

146
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
Hmm? But what Uub?

147
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,708
[UUB]
See, I come from a poor family!

148
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,916
I spend my days
working with my father!

149
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,208
Sports are for fun, Goku!
But there's no time for that!

150
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,541
Oh, I see! Well, we'll just
have to find a sponsor for you!

151
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,208
Hey, I know! Perfect!

152
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,375
Mr. Satan has more money
than he does body hair, so...

153
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,375
He does?

154
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,458
Yeah! Don't worry!
You're covered!

155
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,125
But if anything
ever happens to me,

156
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,000
it'll be up to you to
maintain peace in the world!

157
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Huh?

158
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,250
Be right back!

159
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,083
Huh?! 'Kay!

160
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,750
What's going on?

161
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,833
Hey guys, I hate to do this,

162
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,291
but i just wanted
to let you all know

163
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,541
I'm going to live in Uub's
village so I can train him!

164
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,833
--[CHICHI] Goku?
--[BULMA] That's lame!

165
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,791
I don't know how many
years this is gonna take,

166
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,000
but I promise
I'll visit you guys!

167
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,708
Thank you for understanding!

168
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,125
But we don't understand!
You're leaving for good?

169
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,166
Well! Sort of!

170
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,708
Sort of?

171
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
Not again!

172
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,750
You're leaving?

173
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,166
Gosh, Goku! It's kind
of sudden, isn't it?

174
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,708
[PAN]
Grandpa! It can't be true!

175
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,583
Tell me that it's
not true, Grandpa!

176
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,791
[sobs]

177
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,250
What's wrong? Hey!

178
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,333
Grandpa! Are you really leaving?

179
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,083
Yes! Hmm?

180
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,416
[PAN]
You can't go! It's not fair!

181
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,708
What am I going
to do without you?

182
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,916
[GOKU]
Hey! Hey! Pan! It's okay!

183
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,791
We'll still get to see
each other now and then!

184
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,083
Grandpa's going
to come and visit you!

185
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,250
Promise?

186
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,625
Yes! I promise.
I wouldn't miss it!

187
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,625
But you can't be sad
while I'm gone! Okay?

188
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,500
Okay! Sure!

189
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,041
Yeah! That's my girl!

190
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,875
[GOKU] Trunks, Goten, please
try to stay focused and train!

191
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,250
Look! I see a
bright future in Uub!

192
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,666
But you guys are the ones he's
gonna look to for leadership!

193
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,500
Right!

194
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,583
I'm gonna train too, Grandpa!

195
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,958
I'm gonna be big and strong like
you! And save the world, too!

196
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,750
[GOKU]
Yeah! That's the spirit!

197
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,666
[GOKU] Hey, Vegeta!
Sorry to disappoint you!

198
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,875
I was really looking
forward to one more bout

199
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,875
with the prince of all Saiyans!

200
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,375
Don't worry about it!
We couldn't play! Not here!

201
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,500
When we fight,

202
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,833
we'll need a whole
planet for an arena!

203
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,833
Ha, ha! You're too much!

204
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,583
Bye, my friend!

205
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,291
Well, let's boogie! Hop on!

206
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,500
Uhh! This okay?

207
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,208
Yeah, perfect! Now! You
live south of here, right?

208
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
Uh, huh!

209
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,375
Well, hold on! We're
heading south! 'Kay?

210
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,583
'Kay!

211
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,166
[GOKU]
Ready? And blast off!

212
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,083
Hey! Wait a sec!
Uub! Goku! Your match!

213
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,166
Aren't you going to finish?

214
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,375
[PAN] Goodbye, Grandpa!
Remember your promise!

215
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,583
[VIDEL] You mean your
Dad's gone! Just like that?

216
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,708
[GOHAN] Yeah, he has this
way of coming and going.

217
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,333
How could he?

218
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,541
I'm sorry!

219
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,458
But Goku's going to
have to grow up someday

220
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,125
and realize that there's
more to life than fighting!

221
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,166
He seemed happy to me.

222
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,791
More so than in a long time.

223
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,458
[DENDE]
Yeah! You're right, Piccolo!

224
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,750
Hmm? Uh, oh! He goes bye, bye?!

225
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,291
Yeah! He's leaving, Buu!

226
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,083
So! You're training
Uub to uphold the peace!

227
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,916
[VEGETA]
Is that it, Kakarot?

228
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,250
Well, you can't
fool me, old friend!

229
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,791
Yes! I know! There's more
to it than that, isn't there?

230
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,541
Hey! How 'bout it?

231
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
Huh? What?

232
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,666
After your training's finished
and you've become flawless,

233
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,833
how 'bout we fight again

234
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,041
so we can test our
powers on each other!

235
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,625
Yeah! Sure!

236
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,958
It'll be awesome!

237
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,875
To be honest, I can't
wait for that day to come!

238
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,875
It sounds thrilling?
Doesn't it?

239
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,666
Going head to head
in an all out battle!

240
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,625
Yeah!

241
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,250
All right!

242
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,916
[GOKU] Hold on tight,
Uub! Woohoo!

243
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,375
Uub! Let the training begin!

244
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,833
Yes!

245
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,750
No need be polite!
Yell! Let it go!

246
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,666
Yeah!!

247
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,750
Once more!

248
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,625
This time let
the whole world hear!

249
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,125
Yeah!

250
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,166
[GOKU, UUB laugh]

251
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,333
[NARRATOR]
Young Uub has been taken in

252
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,541
by the greatest Martial Arts
master in the Universe--

253
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,916
Goku, the orphan
who fell from the stars

254
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,958
to become the savior of mankind!

255
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,416
As the two set off
on a new adventure,

256
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,250
one thing is for certain--

257
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:54,291
as long as Goku lives, peace
and prosperity shall reign!
