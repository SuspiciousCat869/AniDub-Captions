[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,291
After Bulma, Krillin and Gohan
crash-landed on Planet Namek,

3
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,958
two friendly local
inhabitants were waiting,

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,125
ready to offer
a helping hand...

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,625
Showing more hospitality than
the three were accustomed to,

6
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,125
the Nameks decided to
help their new friends

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,000
find the missing
Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,166
[RAITI] Got it!

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,041
[NARRATOR] But even
such dedicated help

10
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,833
couldn't keep the
road to discovery

11
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,000
from being littered
with obstacles.

[CHICHI gently snoring]

21
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,875
I think we should
find the Dragon Balls

22
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,416
as soon as possible
so we can go

23
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,375
and sleep in our
own beds for once.

24
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,125
Well, that sounds great,
but this planet is so huge.

25
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,750
I kinda get the feeling 
this is gonna take a while.

26
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,166
Don't worry. We'll
find them in no time.

27
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,916
There's nothing I like more
than a positive attitude.

28
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,041
Hey, how come Raiti
didn't come with us?

29
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,791
Unfortunately,
he had to stay home

30
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,250
and finish some
work in the garage.

31
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,458
This is strange...

32
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,791
The radar is telling
me that a Dragon Ball

33
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,125
is approaching
us dead ahead!

34
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,375

See what I mean?

[GOHAN] It's
moving pretty fast.

Don't just stand there,
get the Dragon Ball!

[ALL] Uhh.

Why don't we wait for the

[ZAACRO chuckling]

You're gonna have
to wait a long time.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,250
On this planet,
tornadoes have been known

47
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,083
to wander the
plains for ages.

48
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,583
Zaacro and I are
gonna take cover.

Don't waste any more
time, okay? Go!

50

What are you doing?
Don't stare at it!

51

Go get it!

Man... She's bossy.

Are you ready to go
head-to-head with a tornado?

Yup.

ever listen to me?!

for us! Quick, run!

65

This is exactly the kind
of thing that makes me

want to never come back
to this horrible planet!

The only way
to get better

is to get out there
and keep training!

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
[CHICHI] Great! First
my son, now my husband.

166
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,291
[ROSHI] Hmm. Come on, don't
take it so hard. You know Goku.

167
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,541
I'm sure he had a perfectly
good reason to leave.

168
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,291
What?! A good reason to
leave? Yeah, right!

169
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,375
Those two go running off at
the first sign of adventure,

170
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,041
leaving the rest
of us sit around,

171
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,666
pay the bills,
and worry about them!

172
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,458
Woah, woah, woah!
Hold on now, ChiChi!

173
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,041
We both know very
well that they

174
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,708
can take care of themselves
just fine without us.

175
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,250
Are you out of your mind?!

176
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Goku even forgot to
pack his sweater!

177
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,500
I go through the trouble of
making this, and he forgets it!

178
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,333
Why, I could strangle
him with it!

179
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,541
[BULMA] Okay,
here's the throttle...

180
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,250
Check the
fuel gauge...

181
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,958
I think I found what
I'm having for lunch!

182
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,875
Bulma, I don't
mean to rush you,

183
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,541
but I don't
wanna be lunch!

184
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,791
I could work
a lot faster

185
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,083
if you would stop being
such a backseat flyer!

186
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
[roaring]

187
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,375
You know, taking the stairs
would be faster than this!

188
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,791
Instead of
whining so much,

189
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,125
why don't you try and do
something with the angry giant?!

190
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,125
[roaring continues]

191
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,291
All right,
Bulma. Fine.

192
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,500
You ready, Gohan?

193
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,500
[GOHAN] Yup!

194
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,041
I'm gonna tear
all of you apart!

195
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,708
[BOTH growling]

196
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,458
[BULMA] I don't
get it.

197
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,333
How can there not be
an oil pressure gauge?

198
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,333
And what
does this do?

199
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,916
[BULMA growling]

200
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,041
I have had it
with this thing!

201
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:56,750
[engine sputtering]

202
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,750
I did it!

203
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,125
I knew my genius,
scientific mind

204
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,208
would come in
handy at some point!

205
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,875
Destructo Disk!

206
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,208
Yaah...

207
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,125
Hyaah!

208
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,208
[GIANT groaning]

209
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,875
Masenko Ha!

210
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
Haah!

211
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,000
[BOTH] We did it!

212
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:21,916
[GIANT growling]

213
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,208
[GOHAN and KRILLIN whimpering]

214
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,708
[BOTH] Hyaah!

215
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,541
[GIANT roaring]

216
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,958
[BOTH gasping]

217
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,750
[GIANT snarling]

218
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,125
[GOHAN laughing]

219
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,541
Nice catch,
Bulma!

220
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,833
Maybe you'd like
to apologize

221
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,291
for the comments
you made earlier?

222
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,625
You always second-guess
my abilities,

223
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,208
yet I seem to be the one
saving you all the time!

224
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,666
Is that really true?

225
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,416
Now, we only
have two left!

226
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,291
We should be able to go home
much sooner than I anticipated.

227
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,250
I'm all for that plan.

228
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,250
Uh? Eh?!

229
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,750
Eh? Eh?!

230
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:54,958
[GOKU grunting]

231
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,708
[thinking]
Boy, it sure is nice

232
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,958
to feel the wind
through my hair again.

233
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,833
Aahhh...

234
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,166
He looks strong.

235
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
[DOCTOR] I think he
may be ready.

236
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,166
But, let's keep emergency
equipment on standby,

237
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,250
just in case the
worst happens.

238
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,125
I'll initiate the draining
procedure, right...

239
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Now.

240
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,833
You are fully healed now.
You can open your eyes.

241
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,458
Unfortunately,
we weren't successful

242
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,250
in reconstructing
your tail.

243
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,041
[VEGETA] No matter.
I don't need it.

244
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's
recovery has finally ended

245
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,208
and his next terrifying
battle with Goku

246
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,958
is waiting on
the horizon!

247
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,250
Don't miss it as the
adventure continues

248
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,208
on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
