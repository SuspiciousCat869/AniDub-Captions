00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,250
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,083
his patience at an end,
Frieza prepared to finish off

3
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,750
the Z Fighters once and for all.

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,958
As Vegeta and the others
looked on in horror,

5
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:28,416
the evil tyrant at last revealed
the true depths of his power.

6
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,291
With a mighty roar,
Frieza summoned his energy

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,833
and began a monstrous
transformation.

8
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,958
His body bulged and strained
as the tyrant unleashed the

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,083
sleeping terror within,
and as his size swelled

10
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,208
to enormous new proportions,
so did his strength and speed.

11
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,916
Having taken this hideous shape,

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,833
Frieza's already nightmarish
powers were increased tenfold.

13
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,166
[NARRATOR] At last, his
transformation complete,

14
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,583
Frieza set his sights on
the Z Fighters once more.

15
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,500
Well, this is it. I hope
you're not disappointed.

16
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,166
[NARRATOR] Gohan, Krillin,
and Vegeta gaped in awe

17
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,875
at the monster before them,
but little did they know,

18
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,625
the real horror
was still to come.

19
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,750
As Frieza settled
into his new body,

20
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,458
he prepared to demonstrate
his might by eliminating

21
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,458
the Z Fighters one by one.

22
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,500
[FRIEZA roars]

23
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,791
Huh?! What?!

24
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,250
[KRILLIN screams]

25
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,000
Krillin!

26
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,833
[NARRATOR] Helpless
to defend himself,

27
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,750
Krillin has become the
first of Frieza's targets.

28
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,666
Impaled on the monster's horns,

29
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,375
the hero's demise
now seems certain.

30
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,333
Can Gohan save his friend
before it's too late?

31
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,250
Or is this but a taste of what's
in store for all of our heroes?

32
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,916
Find out today on Dragon Ball Z!

33
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,833
[GOHAN] No! Krillin!

34
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,375
[FRIEZA chuckles]

35
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,291
Ugh. What an idiot.

36
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,083
He should have never
tried to stand up

37
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,625
for that insignificant
Namekian kid.

38
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,250
[DENDE whimpers]

39
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,750
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen.

40
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,458
Now it looks like
it's over for him.

41
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,625
[KRILLIN groans]

42
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:06,125
[FRIEZA] Oh, I'm sorry!
Does that hurt?

43
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,666
I guess I just don't
know my own strength.

44
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,791
[FRIEZA chuckles]

45
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:23,125
[KRILLIN screaming]

46
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,416
[GOHAN] Frieza... you monster!

47
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,583
Oh, I beg of you, please
don't hurt little old me!

48
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,416
[KRILLIN whimpers]

49
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

50
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,666
[GOHAN yells]

51
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,916
[GOHAN grunts]

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,833
I... can't breathe...

53
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,375
[KRILLIN grunts]

54
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,875
[GOHAN screams]

55
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:20,416
[KRILLIN shouting,
FRIEZA laughing]

56
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,291
Stay with it! Yee-haw! That's
it, buckaroo! Ride 'em, cowboy!

57
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,250
[FRIEZA laughs]

58
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,000
[KRILLIN screams]

59
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,333
[VEGETA growls]

60
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,208
[YAMCHA] Aw man, how long
do we have to be stuck up

61
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,291
here in this living--

62
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,625
Calm down, Yamcha.

63
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,875
Yeah, cool it already!

64
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,250
[YAMCHA] How do you
expect me to be calm?!

65
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,333
Gohan and Krillin are down
there fighting our battle,

66
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,416
while we're stuck up
here just watching

67
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,916
and waiting for them to
defeat that stupid Frieza!

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And there isn't...
anything I can do to help.

69
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,583
[YAMCHA] Calm down!
Yeah right!

70
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,291
I'm just as frustrated
as you are!

71
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,083
But getting mad isn't
going to solve anything!

72
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,833
Yeah, and I'm sure Goku and
Piccolo can get the job done!

73
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,083
Hey, just take it easy, okay?

74
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,958
You know we can't leave this
place until the battle is won.

75
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,875
So, in the meantime,
try and relax, alright?

76
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
Yeah!

77
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,625
[KING KAI] Goku, how
many times did I warn you

78
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,416
to stay clear of Frieza?

79
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,958
And now that his
powers have increased,

80
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,625
there may only be one
possibility that remains.

81
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,916
That we're all doomed!

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,083
[KING KAI whimpers]

83
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,666
[TIEN] King Kai?

84
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,166
Huh? Yes. Uh, what can I do for
you? How's your training going?

85
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,250
We were just wondering,
are you feeling okay?

86
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,875
Yeah, you look a little pale!

87
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:12,250
Yes. I think it just
might be a little gas.

88
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,916
We-We want to know what's
happening on Planet Namek!

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,791
[KING KAI growls]

90
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,041
Quit stalling!

91
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,583
[growling continues]

92
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,458
Is there something wrong?

93
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,458
[growling continues]

94
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,250
[BULMA] I can't go on...

95
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,875
No, this can't be happening
to me! It's all a bad dream!

96
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,625
I haven't had a shower in days!

97
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,541
I wish... I was
a fluffy cloud...

98
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,041
Huh?

99
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,916
Ah, that looks
like Krillin!

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,166
[BULMA giggles]

101
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,500
Oh my!

102
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,791
Call me crazy, but I think
I'm starting to lose it!

103
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,541
This is not good!

104
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,833
[BULMA] Even worse,
what if Gohan and Krillin

105
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,458
have forgotten all about me
in this miserable wasteland?

106
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:28,458
Oh my, what if Vegeta or
Frieza did them in? Oh no!

107
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,833
That almost makes my bad
hair day seem insignificant!

108
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,791
That means I'll
never love again!

109
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,250
Mind you, that would
require a date!

110
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,083
You gettin' tired up
there big fella, huh?

111
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,750
[FRIEZA laughs]

112
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,875
[KRILLIN] I can't believe it...
Looks like this is the end...

113
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:11,583
Frieza's just too powerful...
Goku... Goku, where were you...?

114
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,708
[GOKU] Hang in there, Krillin!

115
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,041
Once these wounds have healed
I'll be there for you, buddy!

116
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,958
Be strong...

117
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,375
Hm, hm! That takes
care of this one.

118
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,333
Ah! Krillin!

119
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,833
[FRIEZA] Hmm!

120
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,041
How?

121
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,666
[FRIEZA chuckles]

122
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,291
You really think you can save
him? Sorry. It's too late.

123
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,625
Might I suggest you start
worrying about yourself, boy?

124
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,791
[FRIEZA chuckles]

125
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,458
Now, who's going to be next?

126
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,750
Let's see. Will it be you?

127
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,541
[DENDE whimpers]

128
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,500
Or how about you?

129
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,416
[GOHAN growls]

130
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,916
Or how about you?

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,166
It makes no difference to me!

132
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,291
[FRIEZA chuckles]

133
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,500
[GOHAN] You...

134
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:59,375
...a-ni-maaaal!

[GOHAN shouting]

143
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,750
[VEGETA] What's going on?
This kid seems to be getting...

144
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,708
...stronger!

145
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,875

00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:12,541

[GOHAN] Haaaahh...

00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,166
[GOHAN growls]

149
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,583
[VEGETA] Look at his
power. And it's increasing!

150
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,291
[growling continues]

151
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,916
[GOHAN] Masenkooo...

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,583
Haaa!

153
00:13:58,583 --> 00:13:59,750

[GOHAN panting]

158
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,916
[VEGETA] I can't believe
it! I-It's impossible!

159
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,958
From out of nowhere he
just explodes with power

160
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,833
like I've never seen before!

161
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,375
What the--!

162
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,041
That's... That's impossible!

163
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,583
No! There's just no way that
kid could be a Super Saiyan!

164
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,041
It-It can't be!

165
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:17,041
[GOHAN pants]

166
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,500
Ahh...?

167
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,041
K-Krillin?

168
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,375
Ar-Are you there...?

169
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,875
K-Krillin!

170
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,291
[DENDE] He's okay, Gohan!
He's still breathing!

171
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:53,833
Ar... Are you sure...
he'll survive?

172
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,250
[VEGETA] We don't have time
to be worrying about him!

173
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,041
If you think you finished
off Frieza, just look!

174
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,541
Huh?!

175
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,583
Hey kid, I must admit
that you surprised me.

176
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,875
But don't let it
go to your head,

177
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,333
because after all, you're
nowhere near my equal!

178
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,916
Let's just say your
attacked rated a two

179
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,125
on a scale of
one to a zillion.

180
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,500
Now, I think it's time we get
this little skirmish over with!

181
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,333
[VEGETA] Why, you monster!

182
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,208
So, now what are we
supposed to do, Einstein?!

183
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,250
'Cause there's no way in
the world we can beat him!

184
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,583
[FRIEZA laughs]

185
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:29,625
[rumbling]

186
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,791
[GOHAN] Aah! Oh my gosh!

187
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,333
His power level, it's
getting even stronger!

188
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:41,875
[rumbling continues]

189
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:46,500
[VEGETA] You're right, kid!
And we're sitting ducks!

190
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,416
The pain that you
have caused me,

191
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,958
I will return it tenfold!

192
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,958
[DENDE grunts]

193
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,166
[DENDE screams]

194
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,625
[GOKU] Frieza's power
has risen again!

195
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,916
If I don't get
out there, and quick,

196
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,833
Gohan doesn't stand a chance!

197
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,125
[GOKU] Gohan!

198
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,875
Kid, no! Move! Look out!

199
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,750
[GOHAN grunts]

200
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:34,833
Come on. You can't tell me
that I won with just one hit!

201
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,083
Honestly, I was
expecting a little more!

202
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,666
[GOHAN grunts]

203
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,875
[FRIEZA laughs]

204
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,791
[FRIEZA] Well, it
wasn't much of a fight,

205
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,083
but it was fun while it lasted.

206
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,250
[VEGETA] Hey, Frieza!

207
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,041
[FRIEZA] Hmm...?

208
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,083
[explosion]

209
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,083
[VEGETA laughs]

210
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,875
Alright. Rule number one:
Never turn your back...

211
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,916
when you're up against Vegeta!

212
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,291
[VEGETA growls]

213
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,833
Because with me,
the battle is never over,

214
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,291
And there's a good chance

215
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,708
I've got a couple
tricks up my sleeve...

216
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,875
[VEGETA laughs]

217
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,583
Feel my wrath!

218
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,791
Raaaugh!

219
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,375
[VEGETA laughs]

220
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,375
[VEGETA] Never underestimate the
power of a true Super Saiyan!

221
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,083
So while you gloat about
how strong you are,

222
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,958
I'll be the victor!

223
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,875
[VEGETA chuckles]

224
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,875
[VEGETA gasps]

225
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,333
[VEGETA yells]

226
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,500
[VEGETA stutters]

227
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,541
Don't look so surprised, Vegeta.

228
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,458
[VEGETA gasps]

229
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,083
[FRIEZA] I'll be right with you,

230
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,916
but first, I must exterminate
the mighty midget!

231
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,458
[VEGETA] Oh, no. We're all
doomed. We're doomed!

232
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,250
Now then, would you like
to have another shot at me?

233
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,750
[GOHAN groans]

234
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,250
[FRIEZA giggles]

235
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,416
[GOHAN growls]

236
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,541
[shouting]

237
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:54,125
[GOHAN screams]

238
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,083
[GOHAN grunts]

239
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,583
[FRIEZA chuckles]

240
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
[GOHAN gasps]

241
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,541
Where'd he...

242
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,416
[GOHAN gasps]

243
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

244
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,625
[GOHAN grunts]

245
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:50,291
[GOHAN screams]

246
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
[FRIEZA] Sometimes you just
gotta put your foot down

247
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
when it comes to kids.

248
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,375
[GOHAN screams]

249
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,250
Bye-bye... Brat.

250
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,041
[skull cracking]

251
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,916
[PICCOLO] Hang in there,
Gohan! I'm on my way!

252
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,958
Just don't give up!
Please, don't give up!

253
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,083
[GOKU] Gohan...

254
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,583
[NARRATOR] Can Gohan survive
until help arrives?

255
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,625
Will Vegeta come to
our hero's aid?

256
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,791
Or is Gohan's fate at the mercy
of the relentless Frieza?

257
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:54,250
