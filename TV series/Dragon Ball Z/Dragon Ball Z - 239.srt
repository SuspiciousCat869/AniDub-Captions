00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,958
Vegeta made a
devastating attack

3
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,250
that blew the seemingly
invincible Majin Buu

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,833
to smithereens!

5
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,291
[KRILLIN yells]

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,375
[NARRATOR] It was an attack
that left the Saiyan Prince

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,875
without any life force
of his own.

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,791
The once cold-hearted Vegeta

9
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,000
had made the
ultimate sacrifice,

10
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,166
extinguishing his own life in
an attempt to rid the Earth

11
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,833
of the evil Majin Buu
once and for all...

12
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,291
[NARRATOR] The solitary warrior
fell to a stony death,

13
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,916
leaving nothing behind except
the hope that Buu was finished;

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,916
that the creature
would trouble his family

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
and friends no more.

16
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,333
[NARRATOR] But when Piccolo
arrived at the scene,

17
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,875
he found that the
elastic remnants

18
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,625
of Majin Buu were
far from dead.

19
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,500
The Namek could only
look on in horror

20
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,916
at the amazing resurrection
of the unstoppable Buu.

21
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,416
[NARRATOR]
In a bubblegum-like frenzy,

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,291
the terrifying nemesis reformed
into his original shape,

23
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,000
fully rejuvenated.

24
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,041
[BUU]
Buuuuu.

25
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,458
[BABIDI whimpers]

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,541
[NARRATOR] Not fairing so well
was the wicked Babidi

27
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,958
who angrily commanded
Buu to use his powers

28
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,125
to restore him
back to full health.

29
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,833
[NARRATOR] And the duo of
darkness was back in action,

30
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:38,166
ready to wreak havoc on the
inhabitants of Earth once again.

31
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,958
[BABIDI] There'll be no quick
end for those scoundrels.

32
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,875
[NARRATOR]
Elsewhere, deep in the forest,

33
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,208
Gohan barely clings to life.

34
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,250
But can anything prevent
the young warrior

35
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,458
from crossing through
death's door?

36
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,833
[YAMCHA]
Six down and one to go.

37
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,250
At least the Dragon Ball
hunting's going well.

38
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,166
[ROSHI] That's right. And, uh,
do you think we can pull over?

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,916
I, uh, need a break.
I had a lot to drink...

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,708
[VIDEL]
I just hope these things work.

41
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,541
Oh, they work. You don't have
to worry about that, Videl.

42
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,708
That's good.

43
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,166
But, hey, shouldn't
we be looking for

44
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,625
Trunks and Goten, you guys?

45
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,041
Isn't that a
little more important

46
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,458
than finding the Dragon Balls?

47
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,000
[CHICHI]
Huh. What do you think, Bulma?

48
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,916
I don't know, but Trunks and
Goten could be anywhere.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,250
At least with
the Dragon Balls

50
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,041
we know we're
accomplishing something.

51
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,458
And besides, I wanna
wish the people that

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,291
Vegeta killed in the
stadium back to life.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,208
I owe it to them. That was
a terrible thing Vegeta did.

54
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,500
We should be getting
pretty close, huh?

55
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,208
What d'you say one hour?

56
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,333
Mm-hmm. We're close. Just keep
heading in this direction.

57
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,125
I'd say another
15 minutes or so.

58
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,666
Bulma, be truthful:
Is one of the reasons

59
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,333
that you're so intent on
gathering Dragon Balls,

60
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,291
well, you know, that something's
happened to the boys?

61
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,750
No, I think the boys
are okay, ChiChi.

62
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,333
For some reason I haven't
been too worried about that.

63
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,833
I did get a sick feeling in my
heart about Vegeta though.

64
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,416
He might need to be
wished back to life,

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,916
but I don't think I
want to wish him back.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,625
Unless... he's back
to the way he was.

67
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,208
Don't worry, Bulma.
He'll be fine.

68
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,916
Vegeta's not one to
be controlled.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,916
I hope you're right.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,125
Hey, we've got an
exact fix on that last ball.

71
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,958
Steady as she goes, Yamcha.

72
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,333
[YAMCHA]
Right.

73
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,208
It's kind of hard to believe
that you can actually

74
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,833
wish people back from the
dead with these things.

75
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,416
Well, look at me.

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,958
I was as dead as you can get,
and I was wished back to life.

77
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,541
[BULMA] Don't worry, Videl.
Most people come back normal.

78
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,750
[YAMCHA] Hey! What's that
supposed to mean?!

79
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,083
[BULMA]
Slow down, Yamcha.

80
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,166
It must be on that
little island over there.

81
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,333
The Dragon Radar says
that it's at sea level.

82
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,500
That's got to be it.

83
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,416
[YAMCHA]
Okay. Here we go.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,125
[ALL scream]

85
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,958
[BULMA]
What the heck was that, Yamcha?!

86
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,958
[YAMCHA] Hey, that was a
difficult landing!

87
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,708
[BULMA] Especially if you
don't know how to land!

88
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,458
[ALL grunt]

89
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,833
[ANDROID 18] Hey, the plane has
settled. You can get up now.

90
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,166
Hey, thank you so much!
My head almost hit the wall!

91
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,125
I think you may
have saved my life!

92
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,875
I was thrown viciously,
just like this!

93
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,708
But I hit something soft instead
of the wall. It was you!

94
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,333
I don't know
how I can repay you!

95
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,250
I could've cracked
my head open!

96
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,583
But this is so soft and
nice... Thank you so much...

97
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,083
[ROSHI grunts]

98
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:01,125
Let go! Please! I was only
trying to show you something!

99
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,541
How to be a lecherous old man.

100
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,166
No. I was just
trying to show you

101
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,833
how these flotation
devices saved my life!

102
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,541
[ROSHI squeals]

103
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,166
[YAJIROBE] Are you sure that
you sensed someone coming?

104
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,791
I don't see anybody.

105
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,833
Huh?

106
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,166
Hey, what's up with
the runts, you guys?

107
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,333
Hey. Do you have any
more Senzu Beans?

108
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,875
We're not running a
bean factory here!

109
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,666
You just took our last three!

110
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,291
We're gonna have
to start charging.

111
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,666
I'm surprised that you haven't
started charging already,

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,750
knowing you!

113
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,333
Hey! What do you mean by that?!

114
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,333
I live like a monk up here!
I don't even have a TV set!

115

You don't have a TV? Wow!

116
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,416
You really are roughing it up
here. Let's vamoose, Piccolo.

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,583
[YAJIROBE] That's right!
All I do is grow beans

118
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,333
for you ingrates! I can't even
get a pizza delivered up here!

119
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,583
[KRILLIN]
If you weren't so lazy,

120
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,041
you could learn how to fly!

121
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,708
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Hey, he's right.

122
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,333
I could fly my own pizzas up.

It's Piccolo!

Hello, up there!

00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,416
[DENDE] How are you doing?
It's good to see you again.

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,166
Uh-oh. It looks like Trunks
and Goten are injured.

128
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,250
Please don't tell me
the boys have been hurt.

No, they're fine.

130
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
Vegeta just knocked them out
so they wouldn't interfere.

131
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,958
They just need to rest
for a little while.

132
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,083
[MR. POPO]
Oh, thank goodness.

133
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,583
Then we should get
them to bed. Popo?

134
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,666
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,666
I just watched the
sheets yesterday.

And I put fresh pillow cases
on them this morning.

Let's see... They can
use Kami's old quilt!

00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,958
Yes, that's the
softest one we've got.

Thanks, Mr. Popo.

[MR. POPO]
My pleasure.

141
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,916
So then, I take it we haven't

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,208
made any headway
against Buu and Babidi?

143
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,916
Mm. I'm afraid not. We've been
pounded so far. Even Goku.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,125
[DENDE]
I know it's been hard.

I've been sensing
the whole battle.

146
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,041
You have? Then you can tell us
how Goku's doing! Is he okay?!

147
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,958
Well, it is difficult to kill
a man who's already dead.

00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,000
[laughs]

149

Yeah. I guess you've
got a point there.

completely disappeared.

00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,416
His attack had Buu
into a million pieces,

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,250
but Buu just reformed.

157
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,416
How do you beat an
enemy that can do that?

158
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,875
It doesn't seem possible.

159
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,916
Hey. What about Gohan?

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,708
Mmm... I can't sense
him. I'm sorry.

161
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,291
Gohan...

162
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,541
Dende. What about the Supreme
Kai? Can you still sense him?

163
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,541
Oh no. I forgot about Supreme
Kai. I'll try to find him.

164
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,666
[PICCOLO] Good.
There's no way to make a plan

165
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,583
until we figure out who
we have left to work with.

166
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,250
I sense him! You can sense
him, too. Just look with me.

167
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,625
Yes. I feel it! It's faint,
but it's still there!

168
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,541
Buu's power must have
been masking it!

169
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,125
[DENDE] Piccolo, tell me.
Do we have a chance?

170
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,291
Given what we have and
what we're up against,

171
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,333
I'd say no.
But nothings certain.

172
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,625
Ever since I saw Goku transform
into a Super Saiyan,

173
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,208
I don't rule anything out.

174
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,666
[DENDE]
I understand.

175
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,833
You're saying we need
a miracle to win.

176
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,041
But that you've seen
one happen before.

177
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,541
[PICCOLO]
Yes.

178
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,083
So? Would someone tell me
where the heck we go from here?

179
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,208
[MR. POPO] If I were you,
I'd do what Goku would do.

180
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,333
He'd eat the meal I just
pulled out of the oven

181
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,208
rather than fight
on an empty stomach.

182
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,791
[stomach growls]

183
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,375
[chuckles]

184
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,750
Why not? Let's eat.

185
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,750
[KRILLIN laughs]

186
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,208
[KRILLIN]
Hey, wait up!

187
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,333
[thinking] Gohan, have you
really left us, my friend?

188
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,666
I can't feel it in my heart.

189
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:06,000
[SUPREME KAI grunts]

190
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:14,083
Gohan! You have to be alive!
We can't do this without you...

191
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,875
You have got to hold on!

192
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,250
[grunts]

193
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:23,041
[SUPREME KAI] I will not...
give up... until I find you.

194
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,125
[SUPREME KAI grunts]

195

[SUPREME KAI]
Gohan...

196
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,750
[BABIDI] Yes. This will
be a fine city to destroy.

197
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,583
[BABIDI giggles]

198
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,958
[BABIDI] This is great!
Babidi and Buu. Unstoppable!

199
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,000

[BABIDI]
Majin Buu! What are you doing?!

202
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,666
You see that, don't you?! Buu?!

203
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
[screams]

204
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,708
[BABIDI] What are you doing?!
Look out! We're going to crash!

205
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,958
[BUU giggles]

206
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,375
[BABIDI]
Are you nuts?!

207
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,541
Don't ever pull a
crazy stunt like that again!

208
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,750
Ah! Look! I'm bleeding!
I've got a paper cut!

209
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,750
[BULMA]
There you are.

210
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,333
Hey, guys!

211
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,958
I found it but I can't reach it!
How about some help up here?!

212
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,708
[YAMCHA] No deal! You said you
wanted to do it on your own!

213
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,041
Remember? And "get
some aggression out."

214
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,333
[growls]

215
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,208
[BULMA thinking] If I get my
hands on that Dragon Ball,

216
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,791
the first thing I'm going to do
is throw it at Yamcha's head!

217
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,291
[BULMA grunts]

218
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Hey, Bulma! Little stuck?!

219
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,333
Give her a break.
She's a mother, you know.

220
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,958
Doing great! Come on, old gal!

221
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,625
"Old gal"?!
She'd better watch it...

00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,166
[BULMA grunts]

223
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500

Almost there.

Just a little bit more...

[BULMA]
Whoa!

227
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,875
Hey, what's the--?! Ooh?!

Huh? Hey.. Give us back our
Dragon Ball right this second!

238
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you hear me?! Cough it up,
you overgrown beast!

239
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,958
Hey! Come back! That's ours!
No fair! We found it first!

240
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,291
Yaah!

[YAMCHA]
Bull's eye!

243
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,875
You idiot! What do you
think you're doing?!

244
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,708
Go after him! We need
that Dragon Ball!

245
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,208
[YAMCHA]
Right! I'm on it!

246
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,375
[YAMCHA gasps]

247
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,958
Or not. That's one
heck of a jump there!

248
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,458
Hey, these clothes
are expensive,

249
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,666
I'm not jumping in there!

250
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,166
[BULMA] What kind of
lame excuse is that?!

251
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,458
Just take them off
and go in your underwear!

252
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,958
See, uh, that poses a problem.
Ah, I'm not wearing any.

253
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,208
Yeah, right. I bet
you're just chickening out?

254
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,291
Hmm. What about you?

255
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,708
[coughs] Yeah, I'd definitely go
if I didn't have this cold!

256
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,750
[BULMA]
The men are scared.

257
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,166
Well, I'm not.

258
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,625
But I don't feel like
getting wet right now. So no.

259
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,833
At least you
were honest about it,

260
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,541
unlike certain others I know!

Hey, don't get killed!

00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,000
Gohan would never forgive me!

266
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,291
Gotta admit that girl is brave.

Huh? Oh, great!

Well, I've had it!

If no one else is going to
help that courageous girl,

270

then I will!

271
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,166
If all else fails, they
nail you with the guilt.

272
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,958
And now Bulma's going to give me
grief for lying to her!

you a lot of grief,

00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,291
All right. If you don't
want to go left, go right!

312
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,583
Just get out of the way!

313
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,375
Majin Buu! Are you listening?!

314
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,500
[GOKU grunts]

315
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,541
[thinking] Man, I feel like
I was run over by a train.

316
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,250
[gasps]

317
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,125
Oh, yeah, now
I remember. Vegeta...

318
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,333
Figures, first the
guy knocks me out cold,

319
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,625
and then he has to take the
last Senzu Bean for himself.

320
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,541
[GOKU grunts]

321
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,708
[VEGETA]
So Kakarot,

322
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,208
even you can prove helpless
when you drop your guard.

323
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,625
[thinking] Hmm... I wonder
how the others are doing?

324
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,166
I can still sense Buu,

325
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,583
but I can't sense
Vegeta or Gohan either!

326
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,750
This isn't good...

327
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,083
Man, how long was
I out for? Too long...

328
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,791
Something's happened,
something terrible.

329
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,333
Oh! It feels like Piccolo and
Krillin are back in action.

330
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,958
They probably know
what's going on.

331
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,458
Gohan. I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

332
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,708
[KRILLIN]
We're in a real dilemma here.

333
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,250
Gohan and Vegeta are dead.

334
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
Goku isn't
anywhere to be found!

335
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,791
H-How could it get any worse?

336
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,041
[PICCOLO] We've been in
tough situations before.

337
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,541
Yeah, I know,

338
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,833
b-but Goku always showed up
when things got really bad.

339
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,833
Like they are now...

340
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,708
Sorry, guys. I should
be more positive.

341
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,958
That's the way Goku would be!

342
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,500
[PICCOLO]
Goku knows that to win,

343
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,708
you have to believe
that you're going to win.

344
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,958
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, he's like a little kid.

345
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,500
He thinks he can do anything.

346
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,708
Hey, speaking of kids,
do you think it be all right

347
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,375
if I brought my
family up here, Dende?

348
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,166
[DENDE] I'm not sure.
What do you think?

349
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,166
You're the Guardian of the
Earth, now. It's your decision.

350
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,958
Well, technically speaking,
it's not proper.

351
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,416
But, if it wasn't for you guys,

352
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,666
this planet wouldn't even
be here, so I say,

353
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,166
let's bend the rules.

354
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,666
Hey, great!
Thanks a lot, Dende!

355
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,625
Huh?!

356
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,500
Yeah! I feel it, too!

357
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,208
[KRILLIN]
I'm either hallucinating

358
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:50,166
or that's Goku standing there!
Goku, is that really you?

359
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,208
Hi.

360
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,250
He's real! He talks
and everything!

361
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,625
[laughs]

362
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,083
[KRILLIN whimpers]

363
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,208
Hey, what's the deal?
Why are you so sad?

364
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,916
I thought you'd be
happy to see me!

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,083
I'm not sad, you oaf!

366
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,625
I'm just so happy
that I could cry!

367
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,791
You're alive! You're alive!

368
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,166
[GOKU] Well, I'm about as
alive as a dead guy can be.

369
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,541
[KRILLIN]
Look at you.

370
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,000
You look like you've been
through a meat grinder!

371
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,083
How 'bout we get those
injuries taken care of?

372
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,083
Ahh. A Senzu Bean, huh?

373
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,625
No, we're out! But we can
do better than that! Heh, heh.

374
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,250
That is if Dende's willing
to do some healing.

375
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,000
What d'ya say,
Guardian of the Earth?

376
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,791
[DENDE]
Well, of course. Certainly.

377
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,791
[GOKU] Wow, thank you.
I really appreciate it.

378
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,791
[DENDE] Don't mention it.
I'm honored to be able to help.

379
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,750
[NARRATOR] As the weights
of pain and fatigue

380
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,541
are lifted from
Goku's shoulders,

381
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,541
his mission becomes
more and more clear.

382
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,958
With fire in his eyes,

383
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,541
the Super Saiyan has
only one thing on his mind.

384
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:55,041
Ridding the Earth
of the evil Majin Buu!
