00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,708
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,500
the now-teenage Gohan

3
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,291
set out for his
first day of high school!

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,083
There's been
no need for warriors

5
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,291
in the last
seven years on Earth,

6
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,958
so the former child hero
has been hitting his books

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,458
and training his mind instead!

8
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,458
[NARRATOR] Now he's trying
school with other kids,

9
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,125
in none other than Satan City!

10
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,875
[NARRATOR]
But on his way to class,

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,833
Gohan encountered a gang
of ruthless bank robbers!

12
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,291
[POLICEMAN gasps]

13
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,125
[NARRATOR] Never missing
a chance to help,

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,666
Gohan charged up
to Super Saiyan status

15
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,916
and stopped
the thieves himself!

16
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,375
[ROBBER grunts]

17
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
Amazing!

18
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,000
[NARRATOR] It was
a valiant step, indeed.

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,875
But when Gohan
made it to school,

20
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,333
he found that students were
already talking about this

21
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,875
mysterious "Gold Fighter!"

22
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,708
[NARRATOR] And the girl most
likely to discover his secret

23
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:17,166
turned out to be
a very famous daughter.

24
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,666
[ERASA] She's the
daughter of Mr. Satan!

25
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,916
What?! Mr. Satan?!

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,625
[NARRATOR] High school
may not be as simple

27
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,750
as Gohan thought,
since hiding his amazing powers

28
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,750
is proving to be
quite a tricky play!

29
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,708
Is it possible
for the half-Saiyan

30
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,625
to live a normal life?

31
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,583
[VIDEL] Now this is strange.

32
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,625
Huh. So basically,
you don't want anyone

33
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,041
to recognize you, right?

34
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,875
Yeah. That's right.

35
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm just scared my
new friends will think

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,125
I'm a little weird if they
see me fighting criminals.

37
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,916
You think you can
help me, Bulma?

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,833
[BULMA] Well now... you could
always not fight the bad guys,

39
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,166
but I guess playing superhero
is too much in your blood.

40
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,833
So, I'll just have to
make you a disguise then.

41
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,541
Oh wow! You really
think you can do it?!

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,000
Gohan, remember you're
talking to a girl who

43
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,083
designs and builds
space capsules for a living.

44
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,666
I don't think a little
crime-fighter costume

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,083
is out of my reach!

46
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,916
Thanks, Bulma.
You're the best!

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,333
This is gonna make
school so much easier now.

48
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,416
Hey, don't mention it!

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,750
Oh, and Bulma!

50
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,791
Do you happen to know
where Trunks is?

51
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,500
And would you mind if I
hung out with him

52
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,750
while you're working on it?

53
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,208
Sure! Just go on back
to the gravity room!

54
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,000
Last I checked, he was
still training with Vegeta.

55
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,208
Isn't... he kinda young?

56
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,541
Well, I said the same thing,

57
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,250
but as far as
Vegeta's concerned--

58
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,625
if you're old enough to walk,
you're old enough to train!

59
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,375
He's just so dead set on making
Trunks stronger than you!

Heh heh.
Well isn't that nice...

00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,125
Oooh... Gohan!
Now that's a cool uniform!

164
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,333
Hey, thanks, Goten!

165
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,166
I knew you'd be on my side!

166
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,500
[birds chirping]

167
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,416
[GOTEN] Come back soon, Gohan!

168
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,083
Listen. Don't fly too fast.

169
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,291
I just want you safe.

170
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,000
I know.

171
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,833
[GOTEN] Oh wow...!

172
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,375
When I get big...

173
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,625
I hope I'm as
cool as you, Gohan!

174
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,833
[GOHAN chuckles]

175
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,750
Well, for now...
why don't you just make sure

176
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,041
to help Mom
around the house, okay?

177
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,583
See ya later, guys!

178
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,750
[GOHAN] And Goten!
Flying Nimbus is all yours now!

179
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,416
He looks so happy!

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,375
I guess I could
get used to that outfit.

181
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,166
Thank you, Gohan!

182
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,958
[GOTEN laughs]

183
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,916
[NARRATOR]
The young and cheerful Goten.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,083
He is Gohan's little brother,
who Goku left with ChiChi

185
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,125
just before
his fight with Cell.

186
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,583
He's the son
Goku never got to see.

187
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,166
[GOHAN laughs]

188
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
[GOHAN thinking] Man...
school sure seems closer

189
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,166
when I fly there myself!

190
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,708
[GOHAN thinking] At this rate,
I'm gonna have a lot of

191
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,750
free time on my hands.

192
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,291
Hmm... Guess that means
more time for Saiyaman

193
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,125
to save the day!

194
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,250
[SCIENCE PROFESSOR] So you see,
the new energy molecule

195
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,000
is very complex.

196
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:09,166
In fact, well, I'm not even
sure that I understand it.

197
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,708
You know another
hero appeared yesterday.

198
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,541
Yeah, and-and stopped
some Kamikaze drivers!

199
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,458
Yeah. But they say
he's not the Gold Fighter.

200
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,500
Yeah, I heard. He's not.

201
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,083
[GOHAN thinking]
Yes! The news is spreading!

202
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,500
They say he looks kinda' funny,
but he's super strong!

203
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,791
Yeah, uh, they call him
the Great Singing-Man!

204
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,833
Saiyaman!
The Great Saiyaman!

205
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,458
[CLASSROOM] Huh?

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,333
How... in the world do you
know that, Gohan? Tell me.

207
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,416
[GLASSES BOY]
Yeah, how do you know that?

208
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,875
You should--
you shouldn't know that.

209
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,750
Because... I know someone
who really saw him.

210
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,458
Well now, is there something
you'd like to share

211
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,708
with the class, Gohan?

212
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,958
Uhhh... No!

213
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,250
[beeping]
[VIDEL] Huh?

214
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
Yes! Go ahead, Captain.

215
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,375
[CAPTAIN] Videl.
There's been a hijacking

216
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,458
in the City Bus Terminal!

217
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,291
A trio of hooligans
have taken over a tour bus

218
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,125
full of senior citizens and
are holding them all for ransom!

219
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
Aah!

220
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,125
You coppers better
stop your stalling

221
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,125
and bring us the money
or these old folks

222
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,416
are going to be retired!

223
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,916
[CAPTAIN] Videl!
You've got to help us!

224
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,166
[VIDEL]
Stay calm! I'm on my way!

225
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,708
[VIDEL] May I be excused,
Professor?! Thank you!

226
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,708
[SCIENCE PROFESSOR]
Well, actually I--

227
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,833
Okay, on ya go then.

228
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,833
What's wrong with her?
She sick?

229
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,875
No silly! She went to
fight the hijackers!

230
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,041
Aah! All by herself?!

231
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,625
Of course!
I mean she is the daughter

232
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,416
of Mr. Satan you know!

233
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,875
She's always going out there

234
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,875
and saving us from the nasties!

235
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,375
But... that's not safe!

[SHARPNER chuckles]

237
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,041
There's really no need
to worry, Gohan...

238
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,125
Videl can lift even
more weights than I can!

239
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,583
She's been training
her whole life

240
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,125
and some say she's as
strong as her father now!

00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,500
[GOHAN thinking]
As strong as her... father?

Ooh. Well I'm more worried

00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,333
Haven't screamed
like that in years!

324
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,125
This was a very good tour!

325
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,666
Like a roller coaster! Heh.

326
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,250
Who are you?

327
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:05,208
Hm-hmmm! I am...
guardian of the city!

328
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,875
The one and only!

329
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,458
The Great Saiyaman!

330
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,208
[GOHAN thinking]
Oh yeah! That was perfect!

331
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,416
[VIDEL thinking]
What a weirdo...

332
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,666
Is this the hero
they've been talking about?

333
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,833
See ya later, Videl!

334
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,125
[GOHAN grunts]

335
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,833
[VIDEL thinking] Ah!
How does he know my name?

336
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:37,875
[PASSENGERS cheering]

337
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,041
[NARRATOR] A new masked hero
has saved the day!

338
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,750
Not to mention his
high school reputation.

339
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,041
Let's just hope Gohan
can keep his double life...

340
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,125
in one piece!
