00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,208
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,333
Goku was having
an energy crisis,

3
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
but fortunately
the good Majin Buu

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,875
was able to
take up the fight

5
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,125
when the mighty Super
Saiyan lost his shine.

6
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,000
But the kind Buu
wouldn't last long!

7
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,291
Something had to
be done, and fast!

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,125
Hey! I know you've got a plan.

9
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,833
[VEGETA]
Yes. And?

10
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,708
Well, I hate to pry, but
um, what is it, exactly?

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:46,000
Kakarot, how many times have you
saved the world up until now?

12
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,583
Hmm. What?
How many? I'm not sure.

13
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
[VEGETA]
Then perhaps it's time

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,166
to let the world
fend for itself, for once.

15
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,791
Now, listen carefully, Dende!
This is very important.

16
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] And so Vegeta's
plan was put into action!

17
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,541
And Moori summoned the
Dragon on the new Planet Namek.

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,250
[PORUNGA]
Name your first wish.

19
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,750
[NARRATOR]
With the first wish,

20
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,375
the planet Earth was brought
back to its original state.

21
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,375
[NARRATOR]
And with the second,

22
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,958
all of its inhabitants
were restored to life.

23
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,583
But staying alive
was the problem.

24
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,875
What did Vegeta have in mind?

25
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
[VEGETA] Let's do it.
Now! It's time!

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
It's time? Time for what?

27
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,791
The Spirit Bomb!

28
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,875
That's your big idea?
A spirit bomb?!

29
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,208
[chatter. laughing]

30
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,333
Is it really you, baby doll?

31
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,250
Of course it's me!

32
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,416
Whoa, dude!
This is totally cosmic!

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,291
[BOTH laughing]

34
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,333
Yep. Same old world.

35
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,083
[BABY giggling]

36
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,083
What in the world is going on?

37
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,833
It's all back, as if
nothing ever happened!

38
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:35,041
Yeah! This is really bizarre!

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,250
Hey! How come Majin Buu
isn't here, guys? Hmm?

40
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,583
Neither is Mr. Satan.

41
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,125
Aah! Don't tell me
he beat him!

42
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,208
Wow! Wouldn't that
be something!

43
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,958
[CHICHI, BULMA lauging]

44
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,208
[BULMA] And just where were you
two in the next world, huh?

45
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,791
Well, Krillin and I got to do

46
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,583
a little bit of
training with King Kai.

47
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh, I guess we
had it all wrong then!

48
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,250
We just assumed that you
went down to you know where!

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,416
Gee! Thanks a lot!

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,000
[BULMA, CHICHI laughing]

Daddy!

52
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,000
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

53
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey! Whatcha doin'
there, squirt?

54
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,791
[MARON]
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,250
I missed you so much!

56
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,125
Yeah! What a journey!

57
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,666
Being dead wasn't
so bad, now was it?

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,125
Huh?

59
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,041
[chuckles lightly]

60
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,166
Dear Videl, Chichi, Bulma.
I'm so glad you made it home.

61
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,416
Oh, how I wish I
could have joined you,

62
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,333
but not this time.

63
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,291
For too long, love has been
a stranger in my cold heart.

64
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,250
Maybe next time, dear ones.
Maybe next time.

65
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,375
A Spirit Bomb?!

66
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
But that didn't
work against Frieza,

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,291
what makes you
think it'll work now?

68
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,791
It will.

69
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,916
So, that's what you meant
about the world saving itself?

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,583
You want the people of Earth to
supply the energy to beat Buu.

71
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,208
Uh.

Yeah but... do you really
think the people of Earth

95

have that much energy?

Uh! I'm not doubting your plan,

it's just that
Buu's so darn powerful!

It'll be enough!

100

I've learned not to
underestimate the power

of the human race.

102

We won't just take a little bit.

103

We'll take as much as
they can possibly give.

104
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,166
The maximum, huh?

105

third and final wish?

what your third wish is!

How 'bout some new boots.

All of them at one time!

Huh? Uh, are you
saying that you want

120
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,041
to speak telepathically
to the entire planet?

Exactly!

00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,291
What?

Oh, hey! It's King Kai!

00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
Can you really do it?

131
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,166
Of course, I can.
It's a cinch.

132
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,541
Planetary telepathic
communication is my specialty.

00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,958
Okay, Vegeta.
You've got the floor.

135
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,375
Whenever you feel
the urge, just go for it.

136
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,208
That's more like it!

137
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:34,333
People of the Earth!
Listen carefully!

138
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,791
[VEGETA]
As you know,

139
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,208
some very strange events have
been taking place recently.

140
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,375
Your entire planet was destroyed
at the hands of Majin Buu.

141
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,416
But then, in a snap,

142
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,250
everything was
restored back to normal.

143
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,166
Many of you are doubting if
all of this actually happened,

144
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,916
but I can assure you
that this is not a dream.

145
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,958
Not a dream?

146
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,083
Wait!

147
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,375
Hey! What's this
guy talking about?

148
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,583
Shh!

149
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,208
Oh, uh... Uh, right!

150
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,916
He's speaking to
the people of Earth.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,541
Hm?

152
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,000
Uhhh, that's not possible!

153
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,041
Uh, you guys.

154
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,291
Instead of pretending

155
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,791
to talk to the people
of the Earth and all,

156
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,000
why don't you go over
there and please help Buu!

157
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,833
We are trying to help.

158
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,666
Trust me.
This is the best way.

159
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,708
Unfortunately,
Majin Buu is still alive

160
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,166
and the Earth is
still in great danger.

161
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,583
A small group of warriors
have taken up the fight

162

00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,958
Raise you hands up right now
or you're all going to die!

324
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,875
[KING KAI hollers]

325
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:17,375
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,875
[chuckles]

327
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,291
Vegeta is a master tactician.
His plan is excellent.

328
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,250
[chuckles]

329
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,833
Except for one thing.

330
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:33,125
He put his faith in a plebeian
race from the dark ages.

331
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,125
[chuckles]

332
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,541
I finally get to
see those monkeys fry!

333
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,416
[laughs intensely]

334
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,958
Hey! What the heck's
going on down there?

335
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,958
No one except
our family and friends

336
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,125
have offered any energy!

337
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,750
I know that!

338
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,166
For some reason
those idiot Earthlings

339
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,458
won't do what
I tell them to do.

340
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,125
[BUU wailing]

341
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,875
[GOKU] Vegeta!
You've got to try again!

342
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,291
Okay.

343
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:08,791
Hey! People of the Earth!
You are all in great danger!

344
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,125
Majin Buu has not been
defeated! He lives!

345
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,208
Recently your whole
planet was destroyed!

346
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,458
That was not a dream!

347
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,291
And it will happen again
if you don't act quickly!

348
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,583
Stand up for your planet!
Raise your hands!

349
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,541
Lend your strength
and get rid of Majin Buu

350
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,750
before he gets rid of you!

351
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,208
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's plea
has fallen on deaf ears.

352
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,416
As Goku holds the
Spirit Bomb up in the sky

353
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,083
like a symbol of hope,

354
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,333
the Saiyan Prince agonizes

355
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,333
over how to break down
the dam of doubt

356
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:48,041
that is holding back the vast
reservoir of human energy.

357
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,291
Can he get through in time?

358
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:55,375
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
