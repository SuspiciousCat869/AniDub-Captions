[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,541
Majin Buu made
a terrifying escape

3
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,416
from the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,666
and set his sights

5
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,583
on the unprotected
friends atop the Lookout.

6
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,166
[SUPER BUU] No more talk.
I've heard too much of that.

7
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,833
Now, let's just eat.

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,958
[NARRATOR]
With the same horrific method

9
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,041
he used to wipe out
the people of planet Earth,

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,000
Buu transformed the remaining
crew into chocolate,

11
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,666
and devoured them.

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,333
[SUPER BUU yells]

13
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,750
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile,

14
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,208
trapped inside the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

15
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,125
Gotenks ascended
to Super Saiyan 3.

16
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,041
And using his newfound powers,

17
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,916
he forged his own amazing
escape back to the Lookout.

18
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,666
Buu, you'll pay for each one!

19
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,083
[NARRATOR] And it's there
that the battle raged on!

20
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,166
Piccolo could
only watch in shock

21
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,208
as the hallowed Lookout
was smashed into pieces.

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
[GOTENKS] Hold on to
your socks, Majin Buu!

23
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,333
[NARRATOR]
And Gotenks,

24
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,041
using the incredible
powers of Super Saiyan 3,

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,125
was able to subdue the monster

26
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,375
with another
peculiar technique.

27
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
[NARRATOR] But a giant
blast of energy now shows

28
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,916
that the true struggle
is only beginning.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,750
Can the two best fighters
left on Earth prevail?

30
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,958
[GOTENKS yells]

[PICCOLO yells]

32
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,541
[GOTENKS] Wow, check
that out. Some light show!

33
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,541
Don't drop your guard
just yet, Gotenks.

34
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,416
There's going to be
more where that came from.

35
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,083
Arrogant jerk.

36
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,041
I'll give you
something to smile about!

37
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,291
Try this.

[yells, grunts]

39
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,125
[PICCOLO]
Slow down, Gotenks!

40
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,875
You'll destroy
the entire planet!

41
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,333
Make up your mind.

42
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,125
Do you want me to get
rid of this guy or not?

43
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,958
[PICCOLO] Of course,
but not at the expense

44
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,333
of the planet
you're trying to save!

45
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,041
The Dragon Balls
are scattered all over.

46
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,541
Destroy even one of them
and we can wish nothing back.

47
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,583
Oh, I forgot.

48
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,000
[GOTENKS] You know,
I don't wanna

49
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,083
toot my own horn or anything,

50
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,166
but look at
the size of that hole!

51
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,833
If he can still walk after that,
I'll be really surprised.

52

[GOTENKS chuckles]

[SUPER BUU growls]

56
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,333
The guy's barely even bruised.
Man, this is getting old!

[SUPER BUU grunting]

58
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,791
[PICCOLO]
No, Gotenks, look at him.

59
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,083
You did hurt him, but it's not
his body that's suffering.

60
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,916
You've damaged his ego.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,125
As a fighter,
you're his equal.

62
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,000
He's never fought anyone
as strong as himself.

63
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,208
[PICCOLO] This creature has
never faced a true challenge,

64
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,875
and I suspect he doesn't
know how to handle it.

You mean Majin Buu
is a little scaredy-cat!

67
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,000
But how can you blame him?

68
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,000
He's up against the
best fighter in the world,

69
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,333
don't you think?

70
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,291
Give me five more minutes
with him and he's toast!

71
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,583
Do you even have five minutes?

72
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,083
Your fusion will not
last forever.

73
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,541
Then he'll attack
with unrelenting force!

74
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,041
I really doubt that!

75
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,666

He's so resilient.

00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,416
Eeh!

165
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,250
[ALL gasp]

166
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,666
Okay, I will.
But we've got to hurry!

167
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,416
[whimpers]

168
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,666
[GOTENKS]
Hhheeeh!

169
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,125
[thinking] I guess when
things get this desperate,

170
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,625
anything will do.

171
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
Here goes nothing!

172
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
Hmmm?

173
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:45,625
A Super Ghost
Kamikaze Attack!

174
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,791
[SUPERGHOSTS laughing]

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,250
[chuckles]

176
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,625
Just when you
thought you were safe,

177
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,666
the superghosts
come back even stronger!

178
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,375
Now! Superghosts!
Get over there

179
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,791
and turn that guy inside out!

180
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,833
[SUPERGHOSTS]
Huh?

181
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,208
[GOTENKS]
Uh...

182
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:22,666
[SUPERGHOSTS chattering]

183
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,916
Stop flapping your lips!
Get over there and attack!

184
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,958
[ALL holler, chuckle]

185
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,250
[ALL chuckle]

186
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,291
[SUPERGHOSTS yelling]

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,750
All right, it's time to run.

188
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,458
[GOTENKS groans]

189
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,375
[gasps nervously]

190
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,583
[exhales]

191
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,750
[gasps nervously]

192
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,166
[GOHAN] Now that
my training is over,

193
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,458
how do I make sure
what you did

194
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,958
comes through in my fighting?

195
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,583
Well, you just do
that Super Saiyan thing

196
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,625
you always do
and stop worrying.

197
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,333
It'll happen.
Just make sure you let it.

198
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,708
All I have to do is become
a Super Saiyan and believe.

199
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,625
Try believing someplace else!

200
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:46,583
[GOHAN yelling]

201
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:59,250
[bellows]

202
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,666
[yells]

203
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:23,625
[GOHAN bellows]

204
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:46,416
Take a look at that.

205
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,666
[panting]

206
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,708
I can't believe he couldn't have
waited for me to move first.

207
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,250
This is awesome.

208
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,750
Hey Dad, are you
checking this out?

209
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,500
[GOKU] I sure am!
That's incredible, Gohan!

210
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,166
I'm so proud of you!

211
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:21,208
Perfect, Gohan has ascended
past his previous limitations.

212
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,000
But look at him,
he's... normal.

213
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,583
Incredible! He's stronger than
he ever was as a Super Saiyan,

214
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,000
but he looks like
he hasn't changed a bit.

215
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,500
I didn't know sitting
still for a long time

216
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,875
could do that for you.

217
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,000
Hm, I'm the one who
works hard and trains the boy,

218
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,458
and no one even
bothers to help me up.

219
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,125
We should leave
here immediately.

220
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,458
Gotenks can only stall Majin Buu
for a short period of time,

221
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,541
so we have to get to Earth
quickly for this to work!

222
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:53,000
Not us. Gohan will make his
journey to Earth alone.

223
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,416
Huh?

224
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,541
What about my obligations?

225
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,291
I am completely responsible
for that planet's fate!

226
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,291
Your going with him
will not help his chances

227
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,750
of defeating Majin Buu, master.

228
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,750
Your presence would
only present a danger

229
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,791
and impede his concentration.

230
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,500
I will take him back

231
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,958
and then return here
to wait for the good news.

232
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,750
So what's the plan?

233
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,583
Time to go. And you will
be traveling without me.

234
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
Kibito's right.

235
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,583
Good luck, Gohan.

236
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,208
I wish there was a way
I could go with you.

237
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,625
But I belong here now.

238
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,125
Make your father proud, son.

239
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,875
I have faith that
you can beat this guy.

240
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,250
Thanks, Dad.

241
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,625
This is the last time
I'll get to see you,

242
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,375
until you make your
journey over to this world.

243
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,833
[gasps]

244
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,958
You ready? Show him
what a Saiyan's made of!

245
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,541
Yeah!

246
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,291
Okay, go be a hero.

247
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,916
I'm gonna do my best, Dad!

248
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,916
[OLD KAI] He left
without saying a word.

249
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,666
Not a goodbye,
not a thank you,

250
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,291
after all the work
I did for him.

251
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,750
That's kids these days.
No respect!

252
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,708
Now, you're on your own.
The lone Saiyan.

253
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,208
[GOHAN]
Hey, Kibito?

254
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,708
Yes?

255
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,708
I need your help.
I wanna change clothes

256
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,666
but I don't have
exactly what I want.

257
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,416
My father is the
greatest fighter ever.

258
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,458
And I wanna fight in
the same clothing as him.

259
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,375
Of course.
You're quite respectful.

260
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,125
Now, explain to me exactly
what the outfit looked like.

261
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,750
What color was it?

262
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,208
Uh, how 'bout the one
he was just wearing.

263
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,000
That's the one.
Thanks, Kibito.

264
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,875
Anything for a savior.

265
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,208
We anticipate great things
to come from you, Gohan.

266
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Please don't leave us,
and the world, disappointed.

267
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,666
No way. I'm not gonna start
disappointing people now.

268
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,208
All right, this is it.

269
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,958
Aah-uh!

270
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,000
[yells]

271
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,875
Let's not be too hasty!

272
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,708
[BOTH]
You're dead! Huh?

273
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,000
Hey, wait! You're there!

274
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,416
The Fusion must be over!

275
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,083
[NARRATOR] It looks
like Gotenks' powerful

276
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,000
fusion technique has come
to an untimely end.

277
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,416
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

278
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,916
[NARRATOR]
Now separated,

279
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,458
Goten and Trunks are no match
for the fury of Majin Buu!

280
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,166
[NARRATOR]
Their only hope,

281
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,166
and the only hope
for all of planet Earth,

282
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,166
lies in the newfound
abilities of Gohan.

283
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,708
After raising his powers
to unheard-of levels,

284
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,083
he returns to his home
planet as its hero once again.

285
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,041
But will he arrive in time
to save Goten and Trunks

286
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,458
from the impending
wrath of Majin Buu?

287
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:51,000
Find out, when
Dragon Ball Z continues.
