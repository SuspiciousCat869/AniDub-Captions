00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,125
The tables were turned
on the demon king Dabura.

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,500
With the monster Majin
Buu at his bidding,

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,666
Babidi no longer had need
for his former right-hand man.

5
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,541
And the evil wizard was most
eager to see his new pet

6
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,041
cause some
delicious destruction!

7
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,250
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

8
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
[NARRATOR] Quick to recognize
Buu's awesome potential,

9
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,291
Dabura was determined
to put a stop

10
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,291
to the seemingly
simple-minded creature

11
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,625
before he became too powerful
for Babidi to control.

12
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,333
[laughs]

13
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,166
Aaaaarrgh!!

14
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,041
[NARRATOR] But even
his mightiest efforts proved

15
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,916
to be in vain.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Me eat you up! Me eat you up!

17
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,541
Ah ha ha!

18
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,166
You turn into a cookie!

19
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] A flick of
Majin Buu's pink antenna

20
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,583
revealed one of the monster's
most uncanny abilities.

21
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,750
In an electrifying
display of power,

22
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,708
Dabura was reduced to
a harmless foodstuff.

23
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,875
[NARRATOR] And Buu
made good on his promise

24
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,250
to devour the King
of the Demon World.

25
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,250
[NARRATOR] Once again, Majin Buu
enjoyed the taste of victory.

26
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,500
But his delight
would not last long.

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,833
In a fiery blast that
sent Babidi reeling,

28
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,291
another fighter arrived
on the battlefield,

29
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,583
ready to challenge
the bloated beast.

30
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,916
[NARRATOR]
When the smoke cleared,

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,625
the wizard was shocked to
find his spaceship in ruins,

32
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,708
and the man responsible--Vegeta!

33
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,208
Hmph! Yes!

34
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,250
[NARRATOR] For what this
terrifying creature has done

35
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,541
to Gohan and the others,
Vegeta has sworn revenge!

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,583
And with Babidi's
magic augmenting

37
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,958
his already incredible
Super Saiyan strength,

38
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,250
it seems nothing will
stop him from having it!

39
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,625
[GOKU grunts]

40
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,250
Ve... Vege... ta...

41
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:36,500
No! Majin Buu? What's going
on? He's beating you?!

42
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,291
Why can't you do to him
what you did to the others?!

43
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,291
[VEGETA] Is this the best
your monster can do, Babidi?

44
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:49,333
The "terror of the universe"?
Hah! Pathetic.

45
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,375
Uh, wow. And here I thought
he couldn't get any cockier.

46
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,916
Haha haha haha.

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,083
[TRUNKS]
Yeah!

48
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,166
All right! Go for it, Dad!
You can do it!

49
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,625
You got him right where you
want him, now finish him off!

50
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,333
Haha! Yeah go get him!

51
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
[PICCOLO thinking]
Something's happened to Vegeta.

52
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,791
Even for a Super Saiyan,
he seems unnaturally strong!

53
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,375
[gasps]

54
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,416
[VEGETA chuckles]

55
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,875
[PICCOLO thinking] Amazing!
His energy, it's enormous!

56
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,166
I haven't sensed
anything like this since..

57
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,250
since Gohan fought Cell!

58
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,166
But Majin Buu was
able to take Gohan down.

59
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,458
He killed him! I only hope
Vegeta can avoid the same fate.

60
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,458
He's the last chance we've got.

61
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:54,666
And if he fails. No!
Vegeta, you can't fail!

62
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,458
Unless Goku reappears,

63
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,500
all of our lives--this whole
world--depends on you!

64
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,041
[BUU]
Hmm?

65
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,125
Majin Buu!
Don't let him do this to you.

66
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,375
Just eat him or
squash him or something.

67
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,750
Oh... Uh...

68
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,291
Whoa...

69
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:10,583
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
I knew my dad could beat him!

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,250
All right! Goten!
Victory is ours! Heh!

71
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,000
Trunks! Your dad's the best!

72
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,166
Well, of course! I guess you
could say it runs in the family!

73
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
[GOTEN laughs]

74
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,041
[BUU]
Oof!

75
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,833
Huh?!

76
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:56,125
Aahhh! Ooo!

77
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,583
Heehee!

78
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:06,000
[BUU grunts]

79
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,125
What the...?

80
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,750
[cackles loudly]

81
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,916
Buu! You are positively
wonderful! I love you!

82
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,375
Now go and destroy him!

83
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:35,083
[BUU hums]

84
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
[BABIDI]
Buu, what are you waiting for?

85
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,458
Finish him!

86
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,541
Tear him to ribbons!

87
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,666
Do you hear me? Ribbons!

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,041
I don't want there to
be anything left of him

89
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,541
when you're through!

90
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,208
Show him what happens to people
who blow up my spaceship!

91
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,000
[BABIDI]
Are you even listening to me?

92
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
I'm giving you an order!

93
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,041
Do something!

94
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,458
Do you want me to put
you back in your ball?

95
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,000
Because I wil!!

96
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,541
If he's not die by the
time I count to three...

97
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
One, two...

98
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,083
Get him, Dad!

99
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,083
[BABIDI]
Three!

00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,416
Aaah!

Oh...

103
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah!

104
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,416
Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray!

105
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,791
He did it! All right!

106
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,708
[snickers]

107
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,208
[BABIDI]
No.. No.. How could this happen?

108
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:24,916
My pet is gone...
My beautiful pet is gone! Ah!

109
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,625
Huh?!

110
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,750
Yay, Dad! Hahaha!

111
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,958
Huh?

00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,750
[grunts]

113
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,833
[snickers] No, no!
Buu no drop dead.

114

What is he? Immortal?

00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,833
[BABIDI]
Oh ho, yes, victory! Hahahaha!

116
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,750
Go Majin Buu! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

117
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,916
Isn't that right, Buu!

"Drop him dead!"
or whatever it is you say.

119

Big power.

[KRILLIN] Uh, guys, this
looks like our cue to leave.

[TRUNKS] But, we can't!
We can't just leave my dad!

knows how to handle himself!

Ohh! Hohoho! Haaaa!

00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,833
Curse that thing!

145
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,833
How can I beat him if he's
able to regenerate himself

146
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,625
after every attack? Darn him!

147
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,833
That fool thought he was so
tough but just look at him now.

148
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:11,291
He's nothing compared to you
Majin Buu! He's nothing at all!

149
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,666
Too bad he had to go
and disobey me.

150
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,333
He would have made
such a fine subordinate!

Father...

152
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
[PICCOLO] I don't think
even Vegeta will be able

153
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,458
to do this on his own.

154
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:38,916
And Gohan, Goku, the Supreme
Kai, all of them are gone!

155

If Majin Buu wins now.. there
will be no one left to stop him.

Hold on! My dad is
way too strong to lose

00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,666
[VEGETA thinking] I have to try
harder. He must have a weakness!

163
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,916
If this thing can be given life,
he can also have it taken away!

164
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,041
[gasps]

165
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,750
[KRILLIN]
Euggh! Eww!

166
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:04,083
Oooooohhhh!

167
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:09,041
Ugh! What a disgusting
creature. What is he up to now?

168
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,791
Oh, come on!

169
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:21,916
[BUU hums]

170
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,541
Huh?!

171
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,166
So! Are you going to fight me,
or are you just going to spit?

172
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,708
Aaaaaaaaa!

173
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,750
What?!

174
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,083
[snickers]

175
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,541
Ah!

176
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,333
Buu-hoohoo!

177
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,958
[VEGETA grunts]

178
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:07,625
[BUU hums]

179
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,750
Oh no!

180
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,708
Hahaha!

181
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,875
Augh!!

182
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,583
[laughs]

183
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,333
[KRILLIN]
Vegeta's a goner!

184
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,083
Man I wish Goku
and Gohan were here!

185
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,000
Where the heck are
those guys anyway?

186
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,666
Hey! They'll be here,
Krillin! Just wait!

187
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,625
[PICCOLO]
Stay where you are Trunks!

188
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,250
We don't want to lose you too!
There's nothing you can do now!

189
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,333
You'll just cause Vegeta
more pain if you get involved!

190
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:10,958
[laughs]
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

191
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,208
Hyaaaa!!

192
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,750
Trunks wait up!

193
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:25,500
[BUU]
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

194
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,625
Ha!!

195
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,166
[NARRATOR]
To Babidi's great amusement,

196
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,875
Vegeta is getting the beating
of his life from Majin Buu.

197
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,625
The Saiyan Prince is strong,

198
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,291
but unable to defend himself

199
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,458
how much of this
pounding can he withstand?

200
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,875
[BUU laughs]

201
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,583
[NARRATOR] Can the two young
Super Saiyans, Trunks and Goten,

202
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,708
save Vegeta
before it's too late?

203
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,375
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
