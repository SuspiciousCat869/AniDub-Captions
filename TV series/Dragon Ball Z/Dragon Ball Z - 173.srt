Hey, King Kai!

165
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,458
I made it to the Namek's planet

166
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,291
and everything worked
out great okay! Gotta go!

home for dinner, everybody!

Huh? Dende?!

Is he our new guardian?

Yep!

Are you sure it's not too
much for him? He's just a boy!

Hey, don't worry!

Aren't you worried,
Mr. Satan? Even a little?

This was all just a cheap trick!

Cell planted bombs just
before the Military came.

193

He might be an
expert with explosives,

194
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,375
but as you can see, from
a Martial Arts standpoint,

195
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,791
he's an amateur!

Are you
absolutely certain

you're ready to handle
the Dragon Balls?

225
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,166
Lighten up, Piccolo. After all,
the old guy told me that Dende

226
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,541
was one of the most talented
Nameks on their planet!

He's talking
about our Elder Moori.

That's right!

230
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,083
That old guy said Dende had

231
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,750
everything it takes to make
a good guardian for Earth!

232
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,708
I'm pretty sure
I should be able to make

within 100 days!

Hold on, if you still
have the old Dragon Balls

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
and the model
of the Dragon,

239
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,916
then I should be able
to do it right away!

240

Alright!

241

scattered across the Earth,

Oh, hey, Dende,
what about wishes?

247
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,250
Can you make it grant
three just like on Namek?

248
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,000
Sure!

249
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,500
What about its power?

250
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,125
This isn't Namek,

251
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,458
and with three wishes
the Dragon might be weakened!

252
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,208
Now think, can you
make it bring back

253
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,875
all those killed
by Cell with one wish?

254
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
[DENDE gasps]

255
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,041
Well, all I have to do is
re-channel some of its energy

256
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
into its wishing power,

257
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,833
but that way it can only
grant two wishes each time.

258
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,666
Wow! You can really do all that?

259
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,833
Uh-huh!

260
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,166
Good enough, make
the dragon like that.

261
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,125
Yes, I'll try.
So, should I start?

262
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,416
[PICCOLO] Mr. Popo,
bring us the model please.

[MR. POPO] Here we are.

265

this dragon myself.

interesting shape.

267
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,291

behind ya all the way!

00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
The Dragon can
be summoned as soon

275
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,208
as the Dragon Balls
are collected.

276
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,416
Already?

277
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,458
So fast!

278
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,708
[PICCOLO &amp; NAIL thinking]
Good work, Dende!

279
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,333
I always knew you
would be something great.

280
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,375
Now, I'll borrow Bulma's
Dragon Ball Radar

281
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
and go collect them right away!

282
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,125
Good luck, Goku.

283
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,708
Yeah, thanks!

284
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,416
Hey, Gohan, why
don't you stay here

285
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,041
and have fun with Dende
until the tournament begins?

286
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
Uh, are you sure?

287
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,333
I'm positive,
just have a good time!

288
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,666
[TRUNKS] Goku! Uh, can
I ask you one thing?

289
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,250
What's that?

290
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,875
It's because you've discovered
some sort of weak point to Cell

291
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,041
that you're acting so calm
and confident, isn't it?

292
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, I'm afraid Cell
doesn't have a weak point.

293
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,833
Alright, see you later!

294
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,958
Goku! You really do just pop
in and out of places, don't you?

295
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,458
You should take a look
at the circuits on this guy!

296
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,208
Dr. Gero was a genius.

297
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,916
Huh. Well, Bulma,
I'm kinda in a hurry.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,125
See, I got the Earth
some new Dragon Balls

299
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,500
and I was hoping I could
borrow your radar for a while?

300
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,958
Oh, sure!

301
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,000
The radar should be right
there in the second drawer.

302
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,458
Gee, thanks!

303
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,333
Great! Seems to be working!

304
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,875
I should be able to find the
Dragon Balls in no time at all!

305
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,958
Well, see ya!

306
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:51,958
Hey, Goku!

307
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,583
Huh! Oh well!

308
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,375
I was just going to ask him
how Trunks is doing up there,

309
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,500
but... I'm sure he's fine!

310
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,958
Must be close!

311
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,375
Alright, it's right here!

312
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,458
Huh! Well?

313
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,833
[GOKU chuckles]

314
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,291
I don't see it...

315
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,833
Gohan, did your
father tell you anything?

316
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,666
We've all heard Goku say that
Cell is stronger than he is

317
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,916
and that Cell has no weaknesses.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,125
So why is he acting so cheerful?

319
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,666
I've asked my dad and he
hasn't told me anything.

320
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,625
All he says is, "Don't worry".

321
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,500
"Don't worry"?

322
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,375
I don't know. I mean,
if that's what he said,

323
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,250
maybe he really does
have some plan to defeat Cell.

324
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,041
Or maybe he's in denial...

325
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,625
What's up?

326
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,666
It says it's here, but it's not!

327
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
[MAN] Hey! You there!

328
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,375
Hey! Watch out!
There's a sandstorm coming!

329
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,416
Better shut your eyes!

330
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,250
[GOKU] ...Ohhh!

331
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,875
Of course! These heavy winds
must have buried

332
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,625
the Dragon Ball
underneath the sand!

333
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,958
Thank you!

334
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,250
Now!

335
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,375
Here goes nothin!

336
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,541
[GOKU yells]

337
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,458
This one's bad! I feel
sorry for that guy!

338
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,833
[MAN gasps]

339
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:30,000
Aw yeah! I can't believe Dende
really brought them back!

340
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,875
[NARRATOR] The Dragon Balls
have been restored...

341
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,166
But the clock
continues to tick,

342
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,833
with each fighter
passing the time

343
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,291
in their own way.

344
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,875
[NARRATOR] Some train...

345
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,666
--[GOHAN] So that's what we did.
--[NARRATOR] Some talk...

346
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,291
[KRILLIN] So, you're
always a Super Saiyan?

347
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,208
[GOHAN] Except for
when I sleep.

348
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,125
[NARRATOR] And others
seek to make sense

349
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,375
out of the days
that lie ahead.

350
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,791
[birds chirping,
wings flapping]

351
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:01,833
[elephants trumpet]

352
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,208
[GOKU mumbles]

353
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,208
[GOKU screams]

354
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,041
Only five more.

355
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,625
[NARRATOR] And alone
on the battleground,

356
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,750
the mighty Cell is waiting.

357
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:47,041
How boring, I should not
have given them this long.
