1
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,375
Think again!

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,458
[NARRATOR] After a long
and grueling battle,

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,875
Vegeta was
finally defeated.

5
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,333
But, at Goku's request,
he was allowed to escape.

6
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,625
The Saiyan Prince
promised that one day,

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,458
he would return
for his revenge...

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,791
[NARRATOR] Though the day
had been won,

9
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,000
it wasn't without
its casualties.

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,708
As his fallen friends were
gathered from the battlefield,

11
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,875
Krillin thought of a way
to wish them back...

12
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,041
The Namekian
Dragon Balls!

13
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,875
Yeah, that's
a great idea!

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,250
And if Piccolo comes back,
then so will Kami!

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,000
And that means we'll have
all the Dragon Balls

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
on Earth back
here again, too!

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh, it's that easy.
Well, I've got news for you!

18
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,125
I've done all the calculations,
and the numbers don't lie!

19
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,708
Your little cruise
to Planet Namek

20
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,500
is going to
take 4339 years!

21
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,666
Okay. But,
hypothetically speaking,

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,125
what would happen if we used,
say, a Saiyan spaceship?

23
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,541
[laughter]

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,333
[NARRATOR] So now, with a new
plan and restored hope,

25
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,666
Bulma, Krillin
and the others

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,916
prepare for the voyage
to the Planet Namek.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,833
The quest begins today,
on Dragon Ball Z!

28
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,833
[INVESTIGATOR] Come on! Let's
get this thing outta here!

29
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,833
The sooner we do, the
sooner we can go home!

30
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:59,375
[GOKU screaming]

31
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,458
[KRILLIN whimpering]

32
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:08,083
[GOHAN whimpering]

33
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,458
Gohan, you've got to catch
up on your homework!

34
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,625
Keep studying!

35
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:21,625
[GOKU screaming]

36
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,000
[KRILLIN whimpering]

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,458
Why are you shaking
like that, Krillin?

38
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,041
Uh, because I'm cold!

39
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,166
[DOCTOR] Stop squirming! You're
only making it take longer!

40
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
All we're doing is
changing the bandages.

41
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,708
What is this
guy's problem anyway?

42
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,916
[GOKU screaming]

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,791
I just can't
take it anymore!

44
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,416
I've got to
do something!

45
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,541
I'm gonna find that
Saiyan spaceship!

46
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,500
Just leave that to Bulma.
You need your rest, Krillin!

47
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,541
Yeah, but...

48
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,708
Vegeta could return to attack
the Earth at any time.

49
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,500
You boys need to be
healthy and ready!

50
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,333
You just leave my little
Gohan out of this!

51
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,958
His fighting
days are over!

52
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
Next patient, please...

53
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,291
Don't worry about me!
I think I've recovered!

54
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
Me, too!

55
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,625
[CHICHI and ROSHI growling]

56
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,208
[KRILLIN] See ya!

57
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,083
[ROSHI] Oh, no you don't!

58
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,916
[CHICHI] Get back here!

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,875
[CHICHI] You've got to let
the doctor check you over!

60
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,875
[laughing]

61
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah... But the good news is
there's no serious injuries

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,750
and we'll be outta
here in no time!

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,166
Ohhh... Lucky you, but I
think I'm going to be stuck

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,083
in this contraption
for a good while...

65
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,291
But the worst
thing is,

66
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,375
this is going to slow
down my training...

67
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,875
Don't you worry, Goku.

68
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,166
I'll see if I can
grow some Senzu Beans

69
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,916
to help speed your
recovery up a bit.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Heh, heh. Hey Goku, you should
have seen Yajirobe fight...

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,916
Well, I didn't see you guys
doing any better...

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,458
It's hard to see
when you're hiding...

73
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:13,541
Yeah, he really showed
Vegeta. He was so brave...

74
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,833
I wasn't trying
to hurt you!

75
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,750
I was just playing around!

76
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,166
Ha... Nice one!

77
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,500
Heh, heh, heh. It was strategy!
I was distracting him!

78
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,375
[ALL laughing]

79
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,250
Well, I'm just so
glad that everyone here's

80
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,750
going to be
all right!

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,083
But I just hope that real soon
we can say the same thing

82
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,416
about all of
our friends...

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,708
Heh. We just gotta get the
Namekian Dragon Balls.

84
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,416
They'll be fine.
You'll see...

85
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,583
Hey, guys! Quick!
Turn on the TV!

86
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:55,166
Oh, it's Bulma! I thought
it was a hot new nurse!

87
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Can't you be serious
for a change?

88
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,166
[ROSHI]
I was serious!

89
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,500
I am now standing in front
of the alien spacecraft

90
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,166
that was recovered
from the ruins

91
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,250
of East City
late last night!

92
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,958
For our safety,
it has been placed

93
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,583
inside this
isolation chamber!

94
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,000
The Saiyan
spaceship!

95
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:12,791
Right!

96
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,208
[GOKU] I can't see!

97
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,708
[MALE REPORTER]
Eyewitnesses at the scene

98
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,625
reported a second spacecraft
that mysteriously lifted off

99
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,791
and flew away during the
recovery operation...

100
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,458
What do we do now?

101
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,791
They've got that ship
under lock and key!

102
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,708
But, we need it!

103
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,541
And we'll
have it...

104
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,916
I'll fly it
out of there

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
using this remote control
that Vegeta left behind!

106
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,666
We'll be on
Namek in no time!

107
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,083
You know how that
thing works?

108
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,750
You've gotta be kidding me!
I can work anything!

109
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll just take this and aim
it at the TV... No sweat!

110
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,416
[BULMA] It's just like something
my dad would make!

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,708
All I have to do is punch
in a few coordinates...

112
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,791
Here, these ought
to do nicely...

113
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,375
And then...
We watch...

114
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:01,916
[beeping]

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,208
[GOKU] Watch what?

116
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,416
I can't see anything!
What's going on?

[REPORTER screaming]

118

The spaceship
has exploded!

119
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,333
It powered up and went
into some sort of

120
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,708
self-destruct mode!

121

The building around
me is in shambles!

It can't be! Nooo!

What happened? How could
it just blow up like that?

125
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,250
The remote was supposed to
bring it here, not destroy it!

126
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,000
Now what are we
supposed to do?!

127
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,875
We'll never make it to
Namek now! Never! Never!

128
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,916
Sure seems that way...

remote, Bulma...

C'mon, think, Bulma!

another way...

up with something, Bulma.

If we don't do
something soon,

00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,875
we'll never get
our friends back!

Maybe we should ask Mr. Popo
and see what he thinks...

not quite sure what it is...

not from this planet...

take one of you with me

where it is...

this is the place?

this spaceship, anyway?

talk much, do you?

think you're lost!

[BULMA gasps]

216
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,791
What do you think?

217
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,916
It's a ship,
alright...

218
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,458
What is this? It's not
metal... How weird...

219
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,041
All right!
I've had it!

220
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,500
What exactly do you
know about this thing?

221
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,791
Well, I only know what
Kami told me about it

222
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,416
from the stories of when
he was very young...

223
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,958
It's hard
to remember...

224
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,083
The last time he mentioned
it was over 100 years ago,

225
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,250
but I'll do my best
to recall what I can...

226
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,416
One day, not too
long after lunch,

227
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,291
Kami began telling me about
his mysterious past...

228
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,833
You see, Mr. Popo,
when I was a child,

229
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,291
I used to live in a place
called Yunzabit Heights.

230
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,291
It was very
cold and lonely...

231
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,125
Why would you
live there?

232
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,583
I'm not sure... I was
in a strange accident

233
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,166
and somehow
lost my memory...

234
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,333
How awful...
Then what happened next?

235
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,500
He told me that
he remained here,

236
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,166
waiting for his
parents to return...

237
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,250
Staring out into
the distant skies...

238
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,791
[KAMI] I was certain
that someone

239
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,333
would come
looking for me...

240
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,458
I thought that if I wandered
too far from where I awoke,

241
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,333
no one would be
able to find me.

242
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,916
So there I stayed,

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,125
patiently awaiting the
arrival of my salvation...

244
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,458
But my light of hope
grew more and more dim

245
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,125
as the days
passed me by...

246
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,500
Days led into weeks,
weeks led into months,

247
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,500
and months
led to years...

248
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,416
Finally, after more years
than I care to remember,

249
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,708
I left Yunzabit
Heights behind me...

250
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,583
Sometimes I would
return there,

251
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,500
but I never found any
sign of my people...

252
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,416
Sad, but what does your story
have to do with this ship?

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,666
Because during his time
here, he found this ship.

254
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,291
One day, I discovered 
something very strange...

255
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,458
It was round
and had four legs.

256
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,708
It looked like some kind
of giant alien insect...

257
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,458
As I examined the
strange sphere...

258
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,041
a word seemed to
appear in my head...

259
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,708
I found that if I spoke this
word aloud, a door would open.

260
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,083
Pic-co-lo...

261
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,791
What in
the world?

262
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
What are you
waiting for? Go.

263
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,916
So how do we
get up there?

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,625
You just say the
word again... Piccolo!

265
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,291
[BULMA] Wow...
Look at this place!

266
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,208
If this is some
sort of spaceship,

267
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,791
then how did
it get here?

268
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,833
I got it!
Kami was a Namekian!

269
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,125
King Kai told us
that a long time ago,

270
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,583
Planet Namek was in great
danger of being destroyed...

271
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,083
Yes, I believe I've heard
that story before as well!

272
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,166
They thought their
planet was done for,

273
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,500
so they started
evacuating everyone

274
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,583
on Namek to
other worlds!

275
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,333
If this ship really is
from the Planet Namek...

276
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,000
It kinda makes everything
fall into place!

277
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,416
When their planet
was in danger,

278
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,291
Kami's parents must have
put him on board and

279
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,916
sent him here to
save his life...

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,041
I'm sure they intended
to join him here later

281
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,166
but for some reason,
something happened

282
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,041
and they never made it...
The poor little fella...

283
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,333
Popo! If we can just get
this old thing working,

284
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,333
then maybe we can...
Hey, wait a minute!

285
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,500
If the door opened,
it is working!

286
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,333
But I don't know how
these controls work...

287
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,708
It's alien technology,

288
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,041
so I don't even know
where to start...

289
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,750
Well, uh,
when in doubt...

290
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,875
Just start pressing
some buttons...

291
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,750
[BULMA growling]

292
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,750
It's no use...
It... It won't work!

293
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,166
It must be
missing something...

294
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,833
Spaceship Expert...
Yeah, whatever!

295
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,250
I don't have the faintest
idea what I'm doing!

296
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,666
But I've got to keep trying.
Everyone's counting on me!

297
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,958
Man, I really hope they've
found that spaceship...

298
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,958
[ROSHI] If it's
a spaceship...

299
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,041
[ROSHI sighs]

300
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,166
[GOKU thinking] Please,
Bulma... Hurry!

301
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,208
[BULMA] Move,
you hunk of junk!

302
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,916
What will I
say to everyone?

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,291
Hmm?!

304
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,333
What is it?

305
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,291
It's what we say
that makes it work!

306
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,625
I don't think
I understand...

307
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,583
It must be run by
voice command,

308
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,958
just like before when you
opened the entry hatch.

309
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,500
But, that would mean all of
the commands are in Namekian!

310
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,750
[BULMA screaming furiously]

311
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:08,041
That's just great! Unless you
speak Namekian, we're stuck...

312
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,875
Wait a minute.

313
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm pretty sure I remember
hearing some Namekian

314
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,416
back at the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

315
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,125
Did you really think
you could fool me

316
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,500
with that fragile
disguise?

317
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,166
Your skills
have improved!

318
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,208
But I don't remember
it enough to speak it...

319
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,125
Well, I don't speak
the entire language,

320
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958
but I think I know
a word or two...

321
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,125
You do?

322
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,041
Sometimes Kami would
mix in strange words

323
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,166
when he would
speak to me.

324
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,125
I learned their meanings
by what context

325
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,416
he would
say them in.

326
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,625
Well, let's
try some of them!

327
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,166
If we can just figure out
one or two simple commands,

328
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,291
we'll be out of this
place in no time!

329
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,333
Can you think of any words that
might make this thing move?

330
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,791
[MR. POPO]
I can say fly.

331
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's try it...

332
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,708
See if you can tell it
to fly us to Jupiter.

333
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,166
Topurukuppa Jupe!

334
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,958
[BULMA] Something's happening!

335
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:02,875
[MR. POPO] What's that sound?

336
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,291
[COMPUTER]
Topurukuppa Jupe.

337
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,000
[whimpering]

338
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,166
[whimpering continues]

339
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,791
Just hang on! We don't
have any safety belts!

340
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,583
[beeps]

341
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,750
[COMPUTER]
Sefte Bette.

342
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,250
Just what in the
world is that?

343
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,916
A toilet! You asked
for one in Namekian!

344
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,000
That's what sefte
bette means!

345
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,333
I didn't say that! I just
need a chair to buckle into!

346
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,791
[COMPUTER]
Juznee Achur.

347
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,666
Juznee Achur
means bedtime!

348
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,416
[BOTH] Huh?

349
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:29,750
We're here! We're already
at Jupiter? All right!

350
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,500
It works! We did it!
We did it!

351
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,958
Now we can fly this
thing to Namek!

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, Kami... Soon you'll
be with us again!

353
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,416
[NARRATOR] Now that
Bulma and Mr. Popo

354
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,833
have discovered Kami's
long-lost spaceship,

355
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,458
a universe of possibility
has opened up!

356
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,041
The search for Planet
Namek continues,

357
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,416
next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
