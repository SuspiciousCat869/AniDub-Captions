1
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,625
You make Buu house!

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,833
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,666
the town folk were
going nowhere fast

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,541
as they tried
in vain to escape

5
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,791
the evil clutches
of Majin Buu!

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,458
[BUU]
Buu put you people to use!

7
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,916
[NARRATOR] It was a bad day
for the helpless citizens,

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,833
who were transformed
into giant lumps of clay!

9
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,750
And what did the diabolical
Buu intend to do

10
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,666
with this great
ball of humanity?

11
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,708
Why construct a
dwelling, of course!

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,250
The proud new neighbor
was moving in!

13
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,958
Meanwhile, in the
safety of the Lookout,

14
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,916
Goku was teaching Trunks and
Goten the Fusion Technique!

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,333
[GOKU] That's it! Oh.
But Goten, your left arm

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,375
is a little bit low!

17
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,750
[NARRATOR] A mastery of the
Fusion Technique would allow

18
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,500
Goten and Trunks to unite
and become one super being!

19
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,750
But before Goku could
complete their training,

20
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,333
it was time for
him to depart

21
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,916
and return to
the Other World!

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,291
[GOKU] Hey, there's nothin'
to be ashamed of, son.

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,625
Goten, gonna take
care of Mom for me?

24
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,500
Goku, you can't put
it off any longer!

25
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,958
Gotcha.

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,208
[NARRATOR] And so,
Goku's magical day on Earth

27
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,875
came to an end!

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,458
It was a time of both
joy and sorrow

29
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,000
for his family and friends!

30
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,083
[GOKU] I'll see you
all sooner or later!

31
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,583
Huh? Wow!
Look at that line!

32
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,666
There must be millions of them!

of dead folks, Baba!

35

[BABA] Yep, they're dying
like flies down there.

[GOKU grunts]

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,875
[GOKU]
What's that thing made out of?

38
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,750
I almost bit my tongue off!

39
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,291
Why'd you put the brakes
on like that? What's up?

40
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,708
[BABA] I'm having second
thoughts, that's all.

41
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,541
[GOKU]
Huh?

42
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, look! I don't
want to be a worrywart!

43
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,666
But I don't feel
comfortable leaving

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,583
Trunks and Goten
to fight Buu alone!

45
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,750
Oh, so that's what's
buggin' you, is it?

46
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,375
Well, if the two boys
learn the Fusion Technique,

47
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,916
there won't be
anything to worry about!

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,125
Are you kidding?

49
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,958
Do you really think
that those little tykes

50
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,041
can defeat a powerful
monster like Majin Buu?

51
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,250
[GOKU]
Mm-hm!

Hmm! All right, then! Let's go!

You're not going to
cut in line, are you?

But don't tell!

the great day, Baba!

destruction in his wake!

Goten and Trunks are trying to
perfect the Fusion Technique,

but in the meantime,

Huh? Oh. Yeah!
Sorry, Dad! Here!

167

Be careful though.
It's kinda heavy!

It sure is a beauty!

[GOKU]
Woah! You weren't kidding!

171
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,375
Really could hurt yourself
swinging this thing around!

Yeah!

00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,875
[GOKU] Now, that's a...
a little easier.

[KIBITO thinking]
First Gohan, now him!

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
How can he wield the
Z Sword in such a manner

179
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,125
without any previous training?

180
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,583
This is truly remarkable!

Nice sword!

Hey, do you mind if I
stay here with Gohan?

184
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,250
Just until he's ready
to fight Majin Buu?

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,166
Yes, of course! That would
be a very big help!

186
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,000
I do have one more request!

187
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,625
It has to do with optimizing
our training regimen!

188

Do you think you could give
us something good to eat?

[SUPREME KAI]
Uh, yes! Why not?

Shall we take a
little break, Gohan?

Sure!

Follow me, then!
We'll round something up!

[GOTEN] So, Dad! What's it like
becoming a Super Saiyan 3?

It is! It's great!

00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,958
You're the first
person I've ever seen!

314
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,500
But, hey! I know you're
beautiful on the inside!

315
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:15,583
Oh? Buu like you!
Buu like you! Ahhhh!

316
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, hey! I have
something for you!

317
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
For Buu?

318
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,125
[TOMMY] Yeah, to pay you
back for helping me to see!

319
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,500
I was gonna buy milk with it,

320
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:30,250
but I'd rather give it to you!
Oh, here it is! Ahh!

321
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,791
No like!

322
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,000
Bleh! Bad!

323
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,833
Boy stay! Buu come back!

324
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,541
[TOMMY]
Oh! He can fly!

325
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:57,541
Wow! That means he's
a superhero! Awesome!

326
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,083
Aha!

327
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,333
[PRODUCE MAN]
Ho, diddley!

328
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,333
It looks like I might actually
make it home on time tonight!

329
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,708
Let's see! Yep!
This one goes-- Hmm?

330
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,250
[yelps] It's you!

331
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,333
Turn into milk!

332
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,416

Yes! Boy why not!
Buu got milk! Give boy!

337

[TOMMY]
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

339
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,708
Don't leave me, Buu!
Please! Come back!

340
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,958
All I had to eat
today was an onion.

341
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,208
No hideous! Buu beautiful!
No hideous! Buu beautiful!

346
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,458
Yay! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

347
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,958
[GOHAN grunting]

348
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,791
That's much better!
Now, let's do it one more time!

349
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:35,791
All right?

350
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,041
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Yes, sir!

351
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,916
[NARRATOR] As Majin Buu

352
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,083
of the Earth, Trunks and
Goten further their quest

353
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,166
to perfect the
Fusion Technique!

354
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,416
But will the boys be able to
master the technique in time?

355
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,666
