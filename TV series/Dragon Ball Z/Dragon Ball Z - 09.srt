1
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR] Last
time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,125
As the two evil Saiyans
hurtled through space

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,791
on their quest to
destroy the Earth,

4
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,541
Gohan was giving
Piccolo a brief preview

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,833
of what would happen
upon their arrival!

6
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,541
Gohan underwent
a horrifying change

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,875
as he unconsciously discovered
the Saiyans' secret power...

8
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,500
their ability to transform
at the full moon.

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,500
And while Goku sought
the Other-Worldly training

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,750
he needs to defend his
home against the Saiyans

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,291
in one year's time,

12
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,791
Piccolo was busy ensuring he
would have a home to return to.

13
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,250
Powerless to fight
the giant ape head on,

14
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,333
Piccolo put a stop to
Gohan's devastating rampage

15
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,541
the only way
he knew how!

16
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,416
[PICCOLO] That tail gives them
the ability to transform. There!

17
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,166
[NARRATOR] After removing
the possibility of

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,791
another monstrous relapse,

19
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,250
Piccolo equipped Gohan with
the tools he would need

20
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,458
to survive his
wilderness training.

21
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,541
And with that,
the mighty green warrior

22
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,833
took his leave to begin some
intense training of his own.

23
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:19,541
What new trials await our
heroes? Find out today!

24
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,541
[GOHAN] Wow... How did I
get down from that cliff?

25
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,500
I can't remember
anything...

26
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,666
Oh, well.
At least I'm down...

27
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,333
Ahh...

28
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,708
Time for
breakfast!

29
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,875
Oh yeah. I should
wash my face first...

30
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,166
[stammers]

31
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,833
[growls]

32
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,416
Uh, hey, what's going on?

33
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,333
Something...
Something's wrong...

34
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,958
Aaahhh!
My tail is gone!

35
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,958
What happened?
Where'd it go?

36
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,333
What the...

37
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,166
These aren't
my clothes! Huh?

38
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,500
[GOHAN thinking]
This is weird...

39
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,125
Aaaahhhh!

40
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,500
Aahh! Ah!

41
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,500
Stay back! Aahh!

42
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,416
Aahhh!
Get away from me!

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,666
Uhh...

44
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,416
Aaahhh!

45
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,375
Stop it! I said
leave me alone!

46
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,416
[growling]

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,708
Huh?! Aaahh!

48
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,916
You don't want me
for breakfast!

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,041
Wouldn't you rather have a
bowl of cereal or something?

50
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,375
Bad kitty!
Bad kitty!

51
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,625
[screeching]

52
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,750
[GOHAN]
Hey! What are you doing?

53
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,875
Let go! Put me down!

54
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,125
[GOHAN screams]

55
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,791
[squawks]

56
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,916
[GOHAN screams]

57
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,958
Help! Somebody!
Help me please! Help!

58
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,875
[GOKU thinking] I need
to find some food...

59
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,375
What's a guy gotta do to
get a burger around here?

60
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,625
[GOHAN yells]

61
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,958
[GOHAN] This sure
is a weird place,

62
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,625
and those pictures
on the wall...

63
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,125
They look like...

64
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,375
They look just like something
I saw in my history book.

65
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,375
Aaahh!

66
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,541
Huh?

67
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,625
A-Aaahhh!

68
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,125
[GOHAN]
What is that thing?

69
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,333
And what's it doing way out
here in the middle of nowhere?

70
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,416
Hmm...

71
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:45,291
[beeping and whirring]

72
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,583
[ROBOT]
Who's there?

73
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,291
Who took me out
of stand-by mode?

74
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,416
Stand-by--Whoa!
It's talking!

75
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,458
[ROBOT] Who are you?
What do you want?

76
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,958
[GOHAN]
I'm, uh...

77
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,166
My name is Gohan, sir!

78
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,500
[ROBOT] Well, Gohan.
Keep your voice down!

79
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,875
What are you trying to do,
bury us under tons of sand?

80
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,958
[GOHAN whispers]
My name is Gohan!

81
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,083
[ROBOT] 
I heard you.

82
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,583
[GOHAN] What are you doing
out here in this place?

83
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,458
[ROBOT] That's none
of your business!

84
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:19,208
Just put me back in stand-by
mode and get out of here!

85
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,041
But there's
no way out...

86
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,875
[ROBOT] Except for that
trail right behind me.

87
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,375
[GOHAN]
What? Uhh!

88
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,250
[GOHAN laughs]

89
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,166
Ah! All right!

90
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,375
[ROBOT] Wait...

91
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,541
[GOHAN] Huh?

92
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,000
[ROBOT]
Stand-by mode?

93
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,875
[GOHAN]
Oh yeah...

94
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,458
[powers down]

95
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,916
Thanks for
everything!

96
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,291
Ha, ha, ha...

97
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,416
Aaahh!

98
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,041
I can't even
see the bottom!

99
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,708
Mr. Robot!
Mr. Robot, I can't...

100
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,083
[ROBOT]
Stop yelling!

101
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,125
Don't you remember
what I told you?

102
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,208
I said I can't make it
down from way up here.

103
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,375
[ROBOT]
That's not my problem.

104
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,708
Uh, but...

105
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,875
[ROBOT] Now put me
back in stand-by mode

106
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,041
and get out of here.

107
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,458
Thanks and have
a nice day!

108
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,583
Nope! Don't
think so...

109
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:32,041
But I can't get out of here
all by myself! I can't!

110
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,666
[ROBOT]
Stop yelling!

111
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,166
Now cut that out, or
you'll bury us both!

112
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,541
Look, I told you how to get out
of here. What's your problem?

113
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,583
What are you, some
kind of cry-baby?

114
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,500
Don't you realize that if
you don't leave right now,

115
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,208
you might be trapped
here forever?

116
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,583
Now get
out of here!

117
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,833
Did you leave?

118
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,625
Gohan! Come back!

119
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,958
You forgot to put me
back in stand-by mode!

120
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:05,458
He's gone. Now I'm stuck
here forever, wide awake.

121
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,500
I can already feel my power
cells draining away...

122
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
Uh, hello?

123
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,500
[ROBOT] You...
You're still here?

124
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,916
I get it! You can't see.
You're eyes are turned off!

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,333
Heh, heh, heh. I'll fix 'em!

126
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,083
[ROBOT]
No, wait! Stop that!

127
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,750
I don't want your help!
Stop... Stop touching that!

128
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,916
What do you think you're doing?

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,083
Don't plug that in!

130
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,708
I don't need to see
anything down here.

131
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,375
You're wasting
precious power!

132
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,250
That's better.

133
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,708
[ROBOT]
Why you meddlesome little...

134
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,041
Hey, you really are little...

135
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,000
What's a kid like you
doing way out here

136
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,125
in my neck
of the woods?

137
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,916
This place
is dangerous!

138
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,083
I know and this
cave is so high.

139
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,500
There's no way
I can jump down!

140
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,166
[ROBOT] Well...
You're just going to have to,

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,125
if you want to
stay alive, that is.

142
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,208
But you could help me
get out of here, right?

143
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,375
Couldn't you?

144
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,791
[ROBOT] Of course,
but I'm not going to!

145
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,250
[rumbling]

146
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,041
You're going to have to learn
how to take care of yourself.

147
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,250
Now stop
bothering me!

148
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,250
[ROBOT] Now put me back in
stand-by mode and leave...

149
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,041
I've already wasted
too much power

150
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,041
dealing with you
and your problems.

this is a buffet?

Wake up!

Please, help me!

[ROBOT] What-what?!
What is it this time?

161
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,041
There's a scorpion!

00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,500
[ROBOT] Well, this is a cave.
Caves have scorpions.

163
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,458
[GOHAN]
But I'm scared...

164
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,166
[ROBOT] They also have snakes,
and bats, and spiders.

165
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,000
Now stop being such a baby
and put me back into stand-by.

166
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,541
[powers down]

167
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,166
[whimpers]

168
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,041
[GOKU thinking] I'm so hungry,
I could eat a, a, a...

169
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,458
Hey, I wonder what
cloud tastes like...

170
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,250
[beeping and whirring]

171
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:49,083
Me again... Do you
have anything to eat?

172
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,291
[ROBOT] Oh, yes!

173
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,458
Being a robot, I always
keep plenty of food

174
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,208
just lying around.
What do you think?

175
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,458
Hungry...

176
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,833
[ROBOT] You could
always make yourself

177
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,125
a nice snake and
scorpion sandwich...

178
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,541
[GOHAN sobs]

179
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,916
[ROBOT]
Now, for the last time,

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,875
put me back in stand-by mode
and stop bothering me!

181
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,166
[GOHAN sobs]

182
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,166
[ROBOT]
Keep it down!

183
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,958
But I'm starving!

184
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,250
[GOHAN cries loudly]

185
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,083
[ROBOT] Look, if you just
stop crying, I'll help you.

186
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,500
But you've got to learn
to control yourself, alright?

187
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,083
[GOHAN] Mm-hm.

188
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
[ROBOT] At this time of year,
the sun shines through a hole

189
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,000
in the far right
corner of the cave.

190
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,958
If you go there and
look very carefully,

191
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,416
you might find
some vegetation.

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,000
That way.

193
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,500
[GOHAN laughs]

194
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,625
Whew!
That was great!

195
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,166
Ahh!

196
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,416
[GOHAN] Look what I found!
Right where you said they'd be!

197
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,083
[ROBOT] Great!
Glad to have helped.

198
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,875
Well, I guess it's time
for stand-by mode again.

199
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,541
But... I can't
eat these raw.

200
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,541
[ROBOT] You're never
going to survive out here

201
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,208
with that kind
of attitude.

202
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:06,250
Hey, wait... Aren't you
a Capsule Corp. robot?

203
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,125
Yeah, I recognize some
of your markings, now.

204
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,875
If you're a Capsule
Corp. robot,

205
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,166
that means you should
have some sort of

206
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,291
built-in cooking system.

207
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,791
Capsule Corp. robots are
supposed to be the best robots

208
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,875
in the whole world!

209
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,875
[ROBOT] Well, I, uh...
I suppose that is true.

210
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,791
Hey! Let's see how that
cooking system works!

211
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,083
[GOHAN] Right!

212
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,208
[ROBOT] How would you
like them prepared?

213
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,416
[GOHAN]
Steamed, please.

214
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,958
[ROBOT]
You've got it!

215
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,625
[GOHAN giggles]

216
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,291
[ROBOT] Would you
like any seasoning?

217
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,333
Something spicy or mild?

218
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:44,000
[GOHAN] Hmm... Can you make them
the same way that my mom does?

219
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,333
[ROBOT]
Uh, well, I, uh... [ding]

220
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,625
Oh, look.
They're done!

221
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,416
[GOHAN]
Ahh...

222
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,208
These sure
taste weird...

223
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,291
[ROBOT] You're welcome.
Hey, wait a minute!

224
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,958
Well, if you don't
like it, then I guess--

225
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,375
It's good.
I'm sorry!

226
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
It's just not mom's...

227
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,625
I miss her so much
and I have no idea

228
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,041
where I am or how
to get back home.

229
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,250
[ROBOT] Yes, that
must be difficult...

230
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,000
And traveling through
this endless desert

231
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,625
to get back there seems
nearly impossible.

232
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,875
Yeah...

233
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,291
[ROBOT] Even if
you knew the way,

234
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,291
everything else is
still against you...

235
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,500
The sun, the wind,
no food or water...

236
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,041
Mr. Robot...
Why are you here?

237
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,208
[ROBOT]
An accident...

238
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,000
Accident?

239
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,250
[ROBOT] I was here to
excavate these ruins.

240
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,916
While I was examining
the ancient hieroglyphics,

241
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,666
there was an
earthquake...

242
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,083
The walls of this
cave were unstable,

243
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,416
and they collapsed
all around me...

244
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I've been stuck down
here ever since.

245
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,208
Wait! Now I remember!
The pictures on the wall!

246
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,833
[ROBOT] What are
you talking about?

247
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,291
They were in my
history book!

248
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,375
That means that the next
time someone comes here

249
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,375
to study them,
they can rescue us!

250
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,458
[ROBOT] But, you're the first
person I've seen in 30 years.

251
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,625
Hey! What are you
doing? Answer me!

252
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,500
[GOHAN] I'm going to
get you out of here!

253
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,958
[ROBOT] Stop that!
I don't need your help...

254
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,125
I'll leave
when I'm ready!

255
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,958
Haven't you heard a word
I've said? Stop digging!

256
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,541
You're almost free, then
we can leave here together!

257
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,666
[ROBOT] I'm storing
up my energy...

258
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,750
Then I can jump out of here on
my own without anyone's help!

259
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,666
Wait! You're
causing a cave-in!

260
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,250
Aaahhhh!

261
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:39,291
[GOHAN whimpers]

262
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,125
[ROBOT] Get out of here!
I can't hold this thing forever!

263
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
Huh? But you're...

264
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,000
[ROBOT] You must leave now!
Use the path I showed you!

265
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,166
[GOHAN] I can't leave
you here! I can't!

266
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
[ROBOT]
You have to!

267
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,333
If you don't, you'll
be buried here forever.

268
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,750
Get moving! I can
take care of myself!

269
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,583
Gohan, please!
This is your last chance.

270
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,625
Climb over me to the pathway
and leave this place! Quickly!

271
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,041
Alright...

272
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:15,333
[ROBOT] Now jump!
Jump out as far as you can!

273
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,041
What are you waiting for?

274
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,875
Do it! Now!

275
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,625
Right!

276
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,875
[rumbling]

277
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,541
I... can't do it!

278
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,333
[ROBOT] Have you
lost your mind?

279
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,958
[hissing]

280
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,291
[GOHAN screams]

281
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,500
[ROBOT]
Gohan...

282
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,375
I stopped this pillar
from crushing us...

283
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,250
But now you are cut off
from the only way out...

284
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,250
Now listen to me
very carefully...

285
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,625
Reach inside my head

286
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,583
and connect the blue
wire to the red one.

287
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,750
They are
right up front.

288
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,208
[GOHAN]
Connect the...

289
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,583
--[ROBOT] Quickly!
--[GOHAN] Right!

290
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,500
[ROBOT] This will route
all of my reserve energy

291
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,833
into my power cells...

292
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,458
Hurry! This place
is coming down fast!

293
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,875
Got it!

294
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:30,291
[ROBOT grunts]

295
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,875
[ROBOT]
Full Power!

296
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:51,375
[grunting continues]

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,916
[GOHAN quivers]

298
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,041
[ROBOT]
Ready, Gohan?

299
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,500
Ready for what?

300
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:23,083
[GOHAN yells]

301
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:43,291
[GOHAN]
Mr. Robot!

302
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,083
Mr. Robot?

303
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,291
Aahh!

304
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,666
Mr. Robot!

305
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,666
It's my fault.

306
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,875
All my fault...

307
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,083
I'm so sorry...

308
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,166
[ROBOT]
Gohan?

309
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,625
I'm here! I thought
you'd left me.

310
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,333
[ROBOT] Not just yet,
but soon...

311
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,083
Throwing that pillar
drained all of the energy

312
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:30,000
in my power cells.
Even my reserves...

313
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,625
[ROBOT] Come now, Gohan...
That won't do any good.

314
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
[GOHAN]
Don't go...

315
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,791
[ROBOT] Remember what
I told you, Gohan.

316
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:48,291
You have to learn to take care
of yourself. Be strong...

317
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,791
[GOHAN sobs]

318
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,583
[GOHAN]
Please!

319
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,833
[ROBOT] No more
stand-by mode.

320
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,291
It's time to shut down...

321
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,625
[voice deepens]
Time to shut down.

322
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,000
Uh?! Mr. Robot?

323
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,708
Wake up!

324
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,625
Come on! Wake up!
Please don't leave me!

325
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,125
Let me help you, the
same way you helped me!

326
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,750
You can't go!
Please! Mr. Robot!

327
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,416
[sobs]

328
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,916
[GOHAN thinks] I don't
know if I can make it

329
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
on my own out here...

330
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,875
But I'll try...

331
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,291
I will try...

332
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,500
[NARRATOR] What awaits
young Gohan as he continues

333
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,208
his life-changing
training?

334
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,583
And what will
Goku find

335
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,500
down this long and winding
path in the clouds?

336
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,666
With every moment they
spend finding out,

337
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,416
the Saiyans move a
moment closer to Earth.

338
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,416
The story continues next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
