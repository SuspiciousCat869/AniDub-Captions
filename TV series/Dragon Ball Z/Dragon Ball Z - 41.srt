1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,250
Gohan, Bulma and Krillin were
on their way to Planet Namek,

3
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,791
when they were taken hostage by
a militant group of refugees.

4
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,916
These heavily armed soldiers
believed our three heroes

5
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,583
to be allies
of Frieza,

6
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,083
who had recently
destroyed their home planet.

7
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,000
[BULMA whimpering]

8
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,458
[NARRATOR] After a few
tense moments,

9
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,458
the case of mistaken
identity was cleared,

10
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,708
and the leader of the group
told the horrifying tale

11
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,333
of his planet's
destruction.

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,625
Frieza's henchmen had
descended upon his world

13
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,666
and destroyed
everything in their path.

14
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,375
They were cruel and merciless,
with a power even more terrible

15
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,000
than that of
the Saiyans!

16
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,083
[NARRATOR] But as awful as
this story was,

17
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,083
there was little time
for our heroes to ponder

18
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,250
the identity of these
mysterious marauders.

19
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,500
For as soon as they resumed
their journey to Namek,

20
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,791
they had problems of
their own to worry about!

21
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,666
[NARRATOR] Bulma's travel
plans landed the ship

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,083
right in the middle of a
fierce interstellar storm

23
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,750
caused by a recently
exploded nebula!

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:21,041
Then, as the ship was thrown
clear of the turbulence...

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,791
[BULMA] Yes! It's Namek!
We finally made it!

26
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,458
Are you
sure that's...

27
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,000
[GOHAN]
Planet Namek?

28
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,791
[BULMA] Trust me,
it's the right planet.

29
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,625
Now, let's go and find
those Dragon Balls!

30
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,958
We're about to
start our descent.

31
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,583
Strap yourselves
in nice and tight.

32
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,958
It's gonna be
a rough landing.

33
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,125
[GOHAN] Right.

34
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,458
Brace yourselves!

35
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,250
It looks like we've got
a rough ride ahead of us!

36
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,041
[GOHAN and KRILLIN yelling]

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,166
[ALL whimpering]

38
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,250
[BULMA] We made it!
And in one piece!

39
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,375
[GOHAN] Great! I can't
wait to see how it looks!

40
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,416
But, there's a lot
of fog right now.

41
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
[KRILLIN] Yeah.

42
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,291
Are you sure this
is Planet Namek?

43
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,250
It better be.

44
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,583
Yeah, but...

45
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,250
Oh, are you trying to
say that I don't know how

46
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,750
to navigate a
spaceship? Is that it?!

47
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,500
No, Bulma. I just
want to be sure!

48
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,875
Come on!
Spit it out!

49
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,375
The Dragon Radar
could tell us

50
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,833
what planet
we're on, you know.

51
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,125
He's right!

52
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,666
Fine... I can't believe
you don't trust me.

53
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,041
[BULMA gasps]

54
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:52,291
[ALL screaming]

55
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,083
Uh, hello.

56
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,125
[laughing]

57
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,958
Looks like
she's awake now.

58
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:22,958
Who are you?

59
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,333
[RAITI] I'm Raiti.

60
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,750
You're looking at the worst
doctor on this planet.

61
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,416
Very funny... Pay no
attention to Zaacro.

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
He's been a thorn in my side
for three hundred years.

63
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,125
What? Three
hundred years?!

64
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,500
[ZAACRO] Nice to
meet you, Miss.

65
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,250
Heh, heh, heh, heh...

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,083
That's the greeting
on this planet.

67
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh... Likewise.

68
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,250
You know... You should
feel very lucky

69
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,375
that we happened to
find you when we did...

70
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,916
I was able to treat your
injuries in time to save you,

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,833
but it was close.

72
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,291
All three of you
were near death.

73
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,625
Thanks for saving us.

74
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,041
Hey, come on guys. Time to wake
up. We've got to get going.

75
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,041
Uh, hey!

76
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,375
[KRILLIN]
Nice to meet you.

77
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,500
[BULMA] This is
Planet Namek, right?

78
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,458
[RAITI]
Sure is.

79
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,708
You guys look very
familiar to me...

80
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,541
Have you ever been
to Earth before?

81
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,250
No, Krillin... They just
happen to look like Piccolo.

82
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,083
You know we'd like to help
you find your Dragon Balls.

83
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,250
[gasping]

84
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,291
How'd you
know that?

85
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,708
[RAITI chuckling]

86
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,250
[ALL gasping]

87
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,375
[ALL gasping]

88
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,958
We know just
about everything

89
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,958
there is to know
about you guys.

90
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,041
Well, if there's one species
capable of doing that...

91
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,791
It would
definitely be a Namek.

92
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,916
Don't worry,
you can trust us.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,875
We won't take
advantage of you.

94
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,458
Do you know what happened
to our spaceship?

95
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes. It's safe. We put
it in our storage garage.

96
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,916
[ZAACRO]
Here it is.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,083
[BULMA] Oh, look
how banged up it is!

98
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,291
I'm glad it's
still in one piece.

99
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,791
[ZAACRO] Me, too.

100
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,458
[GOHAN] Are you always this
nice to complete strangers?

101
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,208
[RAITI] Only with
the ones we like.

102
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,291
Heh. Then I guess
it's a wonderful thing

103
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,166
that we're on your good side,
eh? Thanks for your help.

104
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,666
[RAITI and ZAACRO chuckling]

105
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,750
Look, guys!
I got a signal!

106
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,083
[KRILLIN] Oh, that's great!

107
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,708
[GOHAN and KRILLIN laughing]

108
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,208
Check this out!

109
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,166
It looks like we've got
three Dragon Balls

110
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,916
in the
immediate area.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,375
[KRILLIN] Lucky us!

112
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,875
[GOHAN] Let's start
looking now!

113
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,583
If we hurry, we could find
them all by the end of the day.

114
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,041
[KRILLIN] Yeah! Let's do it!

115
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,208
[BULMA] You gotta
love Capsule Corp.!

116
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,500
[GOHAN] Yeah!

117
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
[RAITI] I wouldn't take
that if I were you.

118
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,666
[BULMA] What?

119
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,416
The outlying territories are
teeming with hundred foot tall,

120
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,916
five hundred ton monsters,

121
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,041
that wouldn't think twice of
stepping on your little car.

122
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,833
It's highly recommended that
everyone travel by air.

123
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,708
Trust me!

124
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,708
Monsters?

125
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,416
[roaring]

126
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
[KRILLIN whimpering]

127
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,625
Uh... Bulma?

128
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
Well, I'm in
a good mood.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,458
I'll take you there
myself in the Wukong.

130
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,916
[BULMA] Wukong?

131
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:15,291
[engine puttering]

132
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:23,333
[puttering continues]

133
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,291
[whimpering]

134
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,833
Now, be honest...
What do you think?

135
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,125
Isn't my Wukong one
beast of a ship?

136
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
[BULMA]
Jackpot!

137
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,708
Excuse me!
The Radar--

138
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,625
It says the Dragon Ball
is right below us!

139
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,250
No problem. Wukong,
start your descent right now!

140
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,250
[ALL screaming]

141
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,291
[hammer clanking]

142
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,833
It's gonna take a miracle to
get this ship fully repaired.

143
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,333
Any luck?

144
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,041
[GOHAN]
Not yet.

145
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,416
[BULMA] Keep searching. It's got
to be around here somewhere!

146
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,500
You can rest
if you want...

147
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,291
You've helped
us out enough already.

148
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,625
No worries.

149
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,750
I really have nothing
better to do now, anyway.

150
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,958
Well, thank you...

151
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,041
Back on earth we're
having a bit of a crisis

152
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,000
without the Dragon Balls
in our possession.

153
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,625
But you already
know that, right?

154
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,083
Yup.

155
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,750
The Radar is telling
me the Dragon Ball

156
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,833
should be ten yards
out that way.

157
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,791
You find it?

158
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,375
[KRILLIN] Uh-uh, uh-uhh.

159
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,833
We're having trouble holding
our breath long enough.

160
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,875
[GOHAN] It's not easy.
The river is really deep.

161
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,375
Well, the Dragon
Radar has never given

162
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,583
a false reading yet.
Hey... Where's Raiti?

163
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:11,833
[RAITI] Got it!

164
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,541
[KRILLIN] Ha-haa!

165
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,958
[GOHAN] Yeah!

166
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,416
Here it is!

167
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,958
Ha, ha, ha! All right!

168
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,375
What happened?!

169
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,083
[SUBORDINATE] Uh, well,
sir, we don't know!

170
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,333
All his readings
are in the green.

171
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,583
[SUBORDINATE] He's fully
conscious now!

172
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,666
[VEGETA] Kakarot!

173
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,958
[APE GOHAN roaring]

174
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,541
[VEGETA thinking]
I don't get it.

175
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,583
I'm much stronger
than him in battle!

176
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,125
Yet, I'm the one taking
on all the damage!

177
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,625
It's as if his power
has increased ten-fold!

178
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,208
[GOKU] Haah!

179
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:48,958
[CHICHI screams]

180
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,708
[PATIENT yells]

181
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,333
Uh?

182
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,416
What are you doing?!
You almost hit me!

183
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Ouch, that hurt.

184
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,166
Why can't you
just lay there

185
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,541
and sleep like a
normal patient?!

186
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,166
You're bothering
everyone!

187
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,666
Because I'm not a
normal patient!

188
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,458
I'm a fighter! I need
to get out of this place!

189
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,125
Oh, Goku. Stop talking
like such a tough guy!

190
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,208
You're injured, and the only
way you're gonna get better

191
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,875
is if you just lay
here and stay quiet.

192
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,916
Is that gonna
be for me?

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,416
Goku, do you
really think

194
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,291
you'll be able
to fit into this?

195
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,250
I could at
least try.

196
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,250
[RAITI] These are ruins
from a city that existed

197
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,625
five thousand
years ago.

198
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,541
[KRILLIN]
That's amazing!

199
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,291
Okay, according
to the Radar,

200
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,916
the second Dragon Ball should
be fifty meters from us.

201
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,291
Bulma, look.
There.

202
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,750
You see it?

203
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,625
[KRILLIN] There're some
stairs leading below.

204
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,208
[BULMA] Yeah, the signal's
getting stronger.

205
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,041
Let's check
it out, then.

206
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,208
[BULMA] Come on,
let's follow him.

207
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,166
[KRILLIN]
Right behind you.

208
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,208
[GOHAN] Wow. These
drawings must be from

209
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,875
the ancient
Namek people.

210
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,291
[KRILLIN]
Are you sure?

211
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,666
Because these drawings don't
look like normal Nameks,

212
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,833
unless they've changed over
the years. Could that be?

213
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,666
Well, no two
Nameks look alike.

214
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,375
[KRILLIN] We're inside
of a tomb, aren't we?

215
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,875
[GOHAN] There may be
a treasure down here!

216
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,208
We're getting really
close now, guys.

217
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,666
[BULMA]
Here it is.

218
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,125
Ah! Be careful!

219
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,000
[stammering in fear]

220
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,833
[BULMA screaming]

221
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,500
Okay! Two down and one
Dragon Ball to go!

222
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,125
He's really
nice, isn't he?

223
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,833
Yeah, you don't see
that much on Earth...

224
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,625
Someone willing to help
a complete stranger.

225
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,416
But that's exactly what
I find suspicious.

226
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,208
We should be careful,
because for all we know,

227
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,750
he's just using us so that once
we get all seven Dragon Balls,

228
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,166
he can steal them!

229
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,208
No way.

230
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,791
It's below
us now.

231
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,875
Could you set the ship
down softly, please?

232
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,416
Setting down!

233
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,625
[BULMA squealing]

234
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,166
[BULMA]
That's strange.

235
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,333
[RAITI]
What's the matter?

236
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,083
Somehow the Dragon
Ball is moving.

237
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,041
[BULMA] Woah!

238
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,750
Are you
okay, Bulma?

239
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,500
[BULMA] I'm okay,
but my Radar is telling--

240
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,041
Huh?

241
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,458
[BULMA screams]

242
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,708
Can I have
that, please?

243
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,041
[BULMA whimpering]

244
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,583
[BULMA] Wait!
Come back!

245
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,041
[KRILLIN] Bulma!

246
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,083
[BULMA] Give me back
that Dragon Ball!

247
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,916
It can't understand
a word you're saying!

248
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,166
[RAITI] Wait, stop!

249
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,875
[BULMA]
What are you doing?!

250
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,916
We mustn't go any
further into the forest!

251
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,208
We have to hurry!
He's getting away!

252
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,250
Why did you stop me?
We lost him!

253
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,000
It's much too dangerous
to go on foot from here.

254
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,458
Huh?

255
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh, that's
just great!

256
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,166
Why did you let
him get away?!

257
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,041
You're planning on stealing
the Dragon Balls

258
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,416
from us, aren't you?!
Tell me the truth!

259
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,708
I-I wouldn't think
of such a thing.

260
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,541
I'm keeping my
eye on you.

261
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,166
Something funny's
going on here,

262
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,791
and I'm gonna
figure it out.

263
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,250
[distant roaring]

264
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,750
That didn't sound normal... 
Something's happened to it.

265
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,458
[RAITI] Let's find out.

266
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,250
[RAITI] The sound we heard most
likely came from here.

267
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,916
[KRILLIN] Whoa!
Is that a skeleton?

268
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,958
[RAITI] It must be the
monster we just saw.

269
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,458
This swamp can melt any
living creature in seconds.

270
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,208
Why, I've heard tales
that even the fumes

271
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,833
can kill a Namek
from a single breath!

272
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,416
Is that right? Now I see why
you stopped me before.

273
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,125
I'm sorry I yelled at
you. I had no idea.

274
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,458
[RAITI] I just didn't want
you to get hurt.

275
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,666
You're too nice!

276
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,333
[KRILLIN] Hey guys,
we've got a problem here.

277
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,416
Since the monster is
obviously dead in the swamp...

278
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,208
Then that means 
the Dragon Ball

279
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,041
must be somewhere
on the bottom!

280
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,750
And if that swamp
melts us instantly,

281
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,958
then how are we
gonna get it back?

282
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,416
It's impossible.

283
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,583
Are you sure?

284
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,458
We do have a
protective body suit

285
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,041
we use for
underwater operations.

286
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,375
But the material
it's made of

287
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,041
is not strong enough
to handle the swamp.

288
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,666
After about 20 seconds,
it begins to rapidly melt.

289
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,958
I'm gonna do it.

290
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,333
[ALL] What?

291
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,875
We have to retrieve
the Dragon Ball

292
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,083
at all costs,
isn't that right?

293
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,875
Well, yeah, I guess
so, but I--

294
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,708
So, all I have to do is surface
within 20 seconds to be safe.

295
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,250
Come on, it's at
least worth a try!

296
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,500
Oh, I know!

297
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,375
We'll tie a special rope
to him and pull him out

298
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,875
before twenty
seconds is up.

299
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
Then we can be sure 
you get out safely.

300
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,833
That's a
good idea.

301
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,541
Okay, then
let's get to it.

302
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,291
It says the Dragon Ball
is directly below us...

303
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,708
Just be quick.

304
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
We'll start pulling you up
at thirteen seconds, okay?

305
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,833
Right.

306
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,416
[ALL] Three...

307
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,083
Four... Five...

308
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,666
Oh no!

309
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,166
I underestimated how potent
the water was going to be!

310
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
[BULMA] Gohan!

311
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,041
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

312
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,958
[thinking] That was
easier than I thought.

313
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,791
All right, pull
me up, Raiti...

314
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,375
Oh no, the rope!

315
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm gonna
have to hurry!

316
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,375
[thinking] I'm running
out of time!

317
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,875
It's gonna eat right
through the suit!

318
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,750
[thinking] I can't
hold on any longer!

319
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,666
Flashing Attack!

320
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,458
Haah!

321
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,958
Gohan...

322
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,541
[GOHAN grunting]

323
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,500
[BOTH] Gohan!

324
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,625
Got it!

325
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,625
Yeah!

326
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,083
Awesome!

327
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,250
Easy! You're
squeezing too hard.

328
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,583
[NARRATOR]
Though they have found three

329
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,833
of the seven Dragon Balls,

330
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,041
each one has been more
difficult to retrieve.

331
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,500
And far away,
Vegeta slowly awakens

332
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,375
from his
recuperating slumber.

333
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,375
Will revenge
be on his mind?

334
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,458

Dragon Ball Z!
