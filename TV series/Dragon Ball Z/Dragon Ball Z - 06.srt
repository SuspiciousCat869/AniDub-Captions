1
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,041
In order to stop
the evil Raditz

3
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,000
and save the
life of his son,

4
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,791
Goku made the
ultimate sacrifice!

5
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,208
And in the battle's
shocking climax,

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,291
both villain
and hero alike,

7
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,500
fell before the might of
Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon.

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,416
Though the battle
has been won,

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,541
a dark threat still
looms over the Earth.

10
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,250
With his final breath,
Raditz revealed that

11
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,250
two more Saiyans,
even more powerful,

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,958
were now on their way.

13
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,458
And for the time being,

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,083
the world has lost its
greatest defender...

15
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:55,500
Take care of
G-Gohan... 'Kay?

16
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,333
I'll wish you
back, Goku.

17
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,708
We already have
three Dragon Balls.

18
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,750
See... you... soon...

19
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,708
Goku?

20
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,166
Goku!

21
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,708
[NARRATOR]
But hope is not lost.

22
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,333
Though Goku has left
this world for now,

23
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,000
Kami, the Guardian
of the Earth,

24
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,000
has plans for
him in the next!

25
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,708
A new adventure
begins today!

26
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,250
Kami took him?

27
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,208
[PICCOLO] That's right.
That meddling old fool.

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,625
[BULMA] Huh?

29
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,791
I don't know why,
and to be honest...

30
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,041
I really don't care.
Goku's dead, either way.

31
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,625
[KRILLIN] What do you think,
Master Roshi?

32
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,916
[ROSHI] Hmm... Kami is
the guardian of the Earth.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,333
Whatever he's doing,

34
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,250
we can at least take
comfort in knowing

35
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,250
his intentions are good.

36
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,625
Yeah, well, I for one will
take a lot more comfort

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,375
once we find the rest
of the Dragon Balls

38
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,458
and wish Goku back!

39
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,791
Ugh! We could really use
Yamcha's help right now.

40
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,125
But as usual,
he's never around.

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,875
'Cause you dumped
him, right?

42
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,791
Hey, how was this Raditz
guy able to find Goku?

43
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,333
I mean, the world's
a big place,

44
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,083
but he came
right to him!

45
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,916
[PICCOLO] That device on his
face is some kind of sensor.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,083
[BULMA] Huh?

47
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,541
[PICCOLO] It detects
strong power levels

48
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,708
and tracks
their location.

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,833
Come here, Krillin.

50
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,375
[KRILLIN] Here...

51
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,375
Okay... What?

52
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,666
Alright, now
reach down there

53
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,041
and pull that
off his face.

54
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
Ugh. You gotta
be kidding...

55
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,333
If I'd known that
was what you wanted...

56
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,166
Here!

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,416
[BULMA]
Now, let's see here...

58
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,375
[beeping]

59
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,500
There we go!

60
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,458
Hmm...

61
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,458
[KRILLIN]
Does it work?

62
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,958
[BULMA] I think
it's been damaged.

63
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,541
I'm going to check
the circuitry.

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,916
Wow... This is
pretty cool stuff.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
There's definitely
a short in here,

66
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,000
but I think
I can fix it.

67
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,083
I'll reprogram it, too.

68
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,791
I think I can get it to display
numbers in our own language.

69
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,500
Wow, Bulma...
You're a genius.

70
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,208
Don't worry, I know.

71
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,083
Now, let's get back
to Master Roshi's.

72
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,500
Once I fix this,
we can find Yamcha,

73
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,625
and maybe Tien too!

74
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,000
[ROSHI] Well, let's
get going then!

75
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,041
We have a lot
of work to do.

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,166
Okay, but we should take
Gohan home on the way.

77
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,625
Yeah, and while
we're at it,

78
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
we can pick up the other two
Dragon Balls that Goku found.

79
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,250
Piccolo, I guess
we'll be seeing you.

80
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,625
Eh...?!

81
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,500
[PICCOLO grunts]

82
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,625
[GROUP yells]

83
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:56,541
[PICCOLO grunts]

84
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,500
[yells]

85
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,625
Aahhh!

86
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,291
[ROSHI and BULMA whimper]

87
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,541
That's a
handy trick.

88
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,250
Before you leave,
I have a request to make.

89
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:19,291
This'll sound strange, but try
to put your emotions aside.

90
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,541
I want Goku's son to come
with me for special training.

91
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,791
[ROSHI] What?

92
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,791
[KRILLIN] No way!
You can't fool me, mister.

93
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,000
Special training...

94
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,125
[PICCOLO scoffs]

95
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,125
You just want to
gobble him up!

96
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,291
I do not!

97
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,083
Then tell us why.

98
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,333
Earlier today this
boy showed signs

99
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,666
that he might be the most
powerful person on this planet.

100
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,291
I think I can teach him
to control his power,

101
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,416
so he can use it to help
us defend the Earth

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,166
when the other
Saiyans arrive.

103
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,916
[ROSHI] Hmm...

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,791
It is a long shot. He might
still be too young. We'll see.

105
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,041
Yeah, he's probably
too young!

106
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,500
Right, I wouldn't
chance it if I were you!

107
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,208
[laughs]

108
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,000
Hm. At any rate, I'd say you'd
have to ask the boy's mother!

109
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,083
I'm not asking,
I'm telling!

110
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,791
[GROUP]
Eh...?!

111
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,833
Look, nothing else
matters right now

112
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,458
except beating the other
Saiyans in one year.

113
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,916
The boy's in good hands.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,791
[chuckles]

115
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,125
[GROUP] Aahh!

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,416
When you wish
Goku back,

117
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,291
tell him he can look
forward to seeing his son

118
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,791
one year from now.

119
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,125
I'll do what I can with
this pampered kid...

120
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,833
Hopefully our work
will bear fruit...

121
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,666
Remember, tell
him one year!

122
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,208
I never was a
good babysitter...

123
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:48,666
Now we're done for...
So who's gonna tell ChiChi?

124
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
[ROSHI]
Oh, right...

125
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,083
I couldn't do it...

126
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,625
Goku, where are you?

127
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,375
We really need
you, buddy.

128
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,375
[DIRECTOR] Please approach
the check-in station

129
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,000
in an orderly fashion!

130
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,125
Alright, behave
you ingrates!

131
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,416
Hey! You right there!
That's enough!

132
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,833
Get back in
line right now!

133
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,875
That's right...
Move along!

134
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,375
Proceed in an
orderly fashion!

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,166
No cutting!

136
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,291
[KAMI] And that's where
we stand, Great King Yemma.

137
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,333
The other two Saiyans are on
their way to Earth right now.

138
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,625
For this reason we humbly
ask that you allow Goku

139
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,916
to seek training from
King Kai himself.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,125
With your permission
of course...

141
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,250
There is no hope for
our planet if Goku

142
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,916
doesn't receive
King Kai's training.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
[YEMMA]
Hmm, Goku...

144
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,791
Well, you certainly have
a service record that merits

145
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,958
letting you attempt
to reach King Kai,

146
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,583
but are you truly prepared
to travel along Snake Way

147
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,458
and risk the hardships
that lay ahead?

148
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,458
[KAMI]
Yes, King Yemma. He is.

149
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,083
Hey! Does everyone end up
here when they die, Kami?

150
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:03,833
[KAMI whispers]
That's right!

151
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,250
Did Raditz?

152
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,916
[KAMI] Yes. Everyone comes
to this Check-In Station,

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,083
and King Yemma decides what
to do with them after that.

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,708
Hey! Did a guy named Raditz
come here not too long ago?

155
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,083
[YEMMA] Hmm?

156
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,833
[KAMI] Goku, you must address
him as 'King Yemma'!

157
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:23,333
Uh... Hm. Yes, let me see.
Oh, yes, your brother...

158
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,833
I sent him below...
What a case.

159
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,666
Did he fight you?

160
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,958
[YEMMA]
Well, he tried!

161
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,791
But I got him in my patented

162
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,083
'Yemma Lock' and
overpowered him!

163
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,166
Ahh! Incredible!
You must be really strong!

164
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,916
[YEMMA chuckles]

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,333
Hey! Forget King Kai,
I want to train here!

166
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,666
Oh, yes, well, King Yemma's
too busy to take pupils.

167
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,083
Oh.

168
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,875
Be quiet! King Kai is much
stronger than King Yemma!

169
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,500
[YEMMA] Kami!

170
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,750
I heard that,
you little weasel!

171
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,250
Ah!

172
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,250
I'll remember that when
I'm passing sentence on you!

173
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,625
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

174
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,916
Forgive me! I didn't know
your ears were so big!

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,625
I mean so good!

176
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,000
[KAMI laughs nervously]

177
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,000
[YEMMA growls]

178
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,750
[KAMI]
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir!

179
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,958
What I meant
to say was...

180
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,791
Uh, well, what I meant was...

181
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,833
Kami... You're
starting to annoy me.

182
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,791
[KAMI laughs nervously]

183
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,541
Sorry!

184
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,166
Well, I forgive
you this time!

185
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,583
Goku can try to make
it to King Kai's

186
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,916
if he really wants to.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,625
[KAMI]
Thank you!

188
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll call a guide for you.
Now go wait outside.

189
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,875
Thanks!

190
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,708
[YEMMA] Oh, and Goku?

191
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,583
[GOKU]
Yes, King Yemma?

192
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,458
You need to be
very careful

193
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,666
that you don't fall
from Snake Way.

194
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,791
Should you fall off,
there's no coming back.

195
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,291
--Goku...
--Mm-hm?

196
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,583
Stick to it now... Don't let
Snake Way wear on your mind!

197
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,583
Well... I'm not really
sure what to expect,

198
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,666
but I promise I'll
try my very best

199
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,458
to make it to
King Kai's place.

200
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,583
Mm.

201
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,583
So long! I guess I'll
see you in about a year!

202
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,250
[sighs]

203
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,000
[KAMI thinking]
I hope so my friend.

204
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,750
I'm afraid you're in much
more danger than you realize.

205
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,583
The journey down Snake Way
is a perilous one.

206
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,958
But I had no choice.

207
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,958
These Saiyans are a
most fearsome race...

208
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,875
And those on their
way to Earth now

209
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,125
are even more powerful
than the last...

210
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,833
Unless you can make
it to King Kai's

211
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,083
and receive his training,
we have little hope

212
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,416
of defeating them
when they arrive.

213
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,958
Even if Piccolo succeeds
in training your son,

214
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,250
if he is left to fight
the Saiyans alone,

215
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,875
then I'm afraid... we will
all stand before King Yemma.

216
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,416
[YEMMA]
Kami!

217
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,166
You slug!
Get out now!

218
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Yeah, move it!
Who do you think you are?

219
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,583
[KAMI stammers]

220
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,375
[KAMI] Forgive me, King Yemma!
I'll be going now!

221
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,875
[YEMMA growls]

222
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,958
[GUIDE] Yes, I could tell right
away from your cool suit!

223
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Oh, you Kung Fu
guys are so buff.

224
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,875
I mean like
macho-supremo!

225
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,291
You might even have a chance
of making it to King Kai's!

226
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,166
But tell me, do you think a guy
like me could learn Kung Fu?

227
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, I've always wanted
to, I just don't know...

228
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,625
Well sure. It's not
Kung Fu though.

229
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,625
It's the Kamesennin
Style of Martial Arts.

230
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,916
Hey, so what's this 'King Kai'
like? Have you met him?

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,041
Who me? I'm flattered
you think that.

232
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,625
No, I haven't met King Kai
and I don't know of anyone

233
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,291
who has except
for King Yemma!

234
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,250
Wow, and I get to
meet him? For real?

235
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,958
[GUIDE] Well, maybe.

236

[KRILLIN sighs]

237
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,333
[KRILLIN] I guess one of us is
going to have to tell ChiChi

238
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,875
about Goku
and Gohan, huh?

239
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,708
Krillin... You and Goku have
always been best friends.

240
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,625
You tell her!

241
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:10,416
Me? No,
I'd rather die!

242
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,666
I agree, Krillin.

243
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,500
You're definitely the
best man for the job.

[On phone] Hello!

00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,791
Hello?
Master Roshi?

[On phone] This is Master
Roshi. I'm not home right now,

but if you leave your name

please leave a detailed

I hope Gohan
makes it back soon.

I think these batteries
are running low...

You know what they're
doing don't you?

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,791
All those karate-bums

257
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,208
are trying to teach
my son martial arts!

259

Gohan's gonna' train with
Master Roshi? Good for him!

260
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,166
[CHICHI]
No, Dad!

261
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,333
Not 'good for him'!

262
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,666
Gohan's going to be
a scientist! Period!

263
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,083
If you say so...

264
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,083
Oh, Dad. You know how
Master Rohsi's training is.

265
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,041
It's too dangerous
for my little boy!

266
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,250
Not to mention the time
it'll take from his studies.

267
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,833
He'll throw Gohan
into the ocean

268
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,250
and make him swim for miles,
chased by man-eating sharks!

269
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,875
Then he'll leave him
stranded all alone

270
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,416
on some deserted
island somewhere,

271
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,250
and force him to
fend for himself!

272
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,666
And when Gohan climbs
a tree looking for food,

273
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,958
he could be bitten by a snake
and it could poison his brain!

274
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,458
Oh, he'll never be able
to do math again!

the road to King Kai's place.

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know why they put that
big ugly snake head there.

It always gives
me the goosebumps.

[GUIDE] Oh! We must have a
psychic connection or something,

00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:18,166
because I say the same thing
to myself every time I see it.

286
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,958
How long is it?

287
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,750
Well, they say it's over
ten thousand miles,

288
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,625
but nobody really
knows for sure!

Ten thousand miles?!

00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,041
Has anyone ever
made it to the end?

291

Just one person...
King Yemma!

292
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,166
But he made that
tremendous journey

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,041
many, many
centuries ago!

294

Centuries ago?

Wow. If I'd known
Snake Way was this long,

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,791
I would have packed
a lunch or something.

[GUIDE] Oh, I wouldn't
worry about food.

298

You've got a very long way
to go and believe you me,

299
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,250
a lot more important
things to worry about...

Oh, right...

don't fall off Snake Way.

00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,666
Yes, of course!

316
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,541
Okay, great! Can you give
her a message for me?

317
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,208
Tell her I need her to let
Master Roshi and the others

318
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,250
know not to wish me back with
the Dragon Balls for one year!

319
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,583
Tell her I'll
owe her one!

320
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:37,875
Master Roshi...
No Dragon Balls, one year...

321
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,708
And I'll owe you one.

322
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,041
Okay. I've got it!

323
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,416
Well, I better
get started.

324
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,958
Thanks for all your help!
I really appreciate it.

325
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,375
Sure! It's my job!

326
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,333
Here I go!

327
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,958
[GOKU laughs]

328
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,500
He can fly...

329
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,083
You've slept long enough.
Now wake up, kid!

330
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,916
It's time to start
your training.

331
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,041
[PICCOLO grunts]

332
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,875
[GOHAN gasps and coughs]

333
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,625
[PICCOLO] Come on. Get up.
There's no time to waste.

334
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:43,833
Ah! Where am I?
Where's my dad?

335
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,791
Dad? Daddy!
Help me!

336
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,083
The bad Piccolo man has me!
Daddy? Where are you?

337
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,208
[GOHAN sobs]

338
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:59,000
Waahh! Daddy! Help
me, please! Waaahh!

339
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,208
Okay,
that's enough.

340
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,875
We don't have
time for this!

341
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:15,333
[GOHAN sobs]

342
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,875
Shut up!

343
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,625
One more sound, and I'll give
you something to cry about!

344
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:25,041
That's good. Now listen
to me carefully...

345
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,166
Your... Your father is dead.

346
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,458
[gasps]

347
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,791
[PICCOLO] While you
were unconscious,

348
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,416
he died trying to defeat
the man who kidnapped you.

349
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,458
He gave his life
to save yours.

350
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,458
Gohan, quick...
Run! Run now!

351
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,958
D-Daddy...

352
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,708
Don't you dare cry!

353
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,041
I'm not going to warn
you again, got it?

354
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,833
You'll see your
father again.

355
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,416
I'm sure he's told you
about the Dragon Balls?

356
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,916
Even now, his friends are
probably searching for them

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,333
so they can wish him back.

358
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,083
In the meantime, you will stay
here and undergo my training.

359
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,208
You're going to
learn how to fight.

360
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,208
Your father and I barely
managed to defeat

361
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,625
the Saiyan who
kidnapped you today...

362
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,583
And we've learned that two
more Saiyans, even stronger,

363
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,000
are on their way to Earth.
They'll be here in one year.

364
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,875
We won't be able to
beat them alone...

365
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,416
That's why you're
going to train.

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,625
So you can fight
by our side!

367
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,125
What? But I...
But I can't!

368
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,666
I'm just a kid! I can't
fight with grown-ups!

369
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,291
You may not be
aware of it now,

370
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,916
but there is an incredible
power sleeping within you,

371
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,958
waiting to be
unlocked...

372
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,833
If you can
control it...

373
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,833
You could be one of the
strongest fighters on Earth.

374
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,125
No, you're wrong!
I don't have any power!

375
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,000
Heh. Let me show you!

376
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
[GOHAN whimpers]

377
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,500
[GOHAN] Hey, what
are you doing! No!

378
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,708
Put me down! I don't wanna
see my power! Put me down!

379
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:06,250
Waaah-ahh-ahh!
Please! Let me go! Waaah!

380
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,791
[GOHAN yells]

381
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,208
[PICCOLO] Huh?

382
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,375
Ah?! What the...

383
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
[PICCOLO thinking]
I don't believe it...

384
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,041
His power is even
greater than I imagined!

385
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,916
[PICCOLO thinking] How ironic...
To defeat the Saiyans,

386
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
I must now teach
the son of my enemy

387
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,708
to harness a power that could
one day be used to defeat me.

388
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,416
[GOHAN] Wow...
Did I do that?

389
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,583
[PICCOLO]
That's right...

390
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,541
So are you finally
beginning to understand?

391
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,750
This is how
you were able

392
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,583
to help your father,
earlier today.

393
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,500
It's very rare to have
such power at your age.

394
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,333
But to use it, you have
to learn to control it.

395
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,375
That's why we're here.

396
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,583
I'm going to help you
unlock your potential,

397
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,458
so you can grow to
be a true fighter

398
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,541
like your
father and me.

399
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,166
But, I don't want
to be a fighter.

400
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,000
I want to be an orthopedist
when I grow up!

401
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,541
Heh. Is that so?
Well, you still can.

402
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,083
But first, you have
to help us defeat

403
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,875
the Saiyans
when they arrive.

404
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,875
If we can't stop them, they'll
wipe out everyone on Earth.

405
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,041
Then you won't grow
up to be anything...

406
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,208
But I'm afraid...

407
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,583
You'll be far
more afraid of me

408
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,041
if you don't do
exactly what I say!

409
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,125
No more whining!
It's time to train!

410
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,958
Now take off
that coat!

411
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,625
[GOHAN whimpers]

412
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,375
Why? Why do I have
to train with you?

413
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,208
Why can't I train with
my dad when he gets back?

414
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, first of all,
there's no telling how long

415
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,041
it'll take the others
to find the Dragon Balls.

416
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,791
Second, you're gonna
have to learn fast, kid,

417
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,000
and I don't plan on going
easy on you like Goku would.

418
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,083
Achoo!

419
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,916
Oh man, I don't have
enough energy to fly.

420
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,250
But I've gotta
keep going.

421
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,125
[NARRATOR] As Gohan
prepares to undergo

422
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,083
Piccolo's severe
training back on Earth,

423
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:44,625
Goku struggles to overcome his
own trial in the next world.

424
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,666
But can our hero
survive the perils

425
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,125
of the seemingly
endless Snake Way

426
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,000
long enough to reach
the legendary King Kai?

427
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:55,375
The clock is ticking,
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
