Well, five Dragon Balls...

3
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,291
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

4
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,958
Vegeta found the Dragon
Balls Frieza had collected

5
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,458
and threw them
into hiding...

6
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,666
Then, the sinister Saiyan
made his own daring escape...

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,000
[VEGETA} There now.
That ought to do it.

8
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,041
[FRIEZA] My Dragon Balls!
Where are my Dragon Balls?!

[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on the
other side of Planet Namek,

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,583
Krillin returned
with the Dragon Ball

13
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,625
bestowed on
him by Guru.

14
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,541
But it wasn't long
before others

15
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,916
were able to
track it down.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,458
[BOTH] It's Vegeta!

17
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,958
[NARRATOR] And Zarbon,
sent to bring Vegeta

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,583
and the Dragon Balls
back to Frieza...

19
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,208
[Bulma] He's here
to rescue us!

20
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,458
Not even close!

21
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,250
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, Goku
had problems of his own,

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
as a magnetic
storm played havoc

23
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,000
with the gravity
inside his ship,

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,625
leaving him
helpless and weak,

25
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,416
trapped on a
training chain...

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,291
Can our hero withstand
this interstellar onslaught?

27

The magnetic storm!

There's no way Goku can
take another hour in there!

It's killing him!

40

Doctor,
do something!

41
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,541

of yours for something! Please!

I've figured it out!

Bulma, I... I really don't
think he's here for a date!

64
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,541
You think he'd go
on a date with me?

Come on! Snap
out of it already.

66
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,500
I wonder if
he's noticed me?

67
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,916
He has, but not in the
way that you're thinking...

68
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,416
Vegeta, did you really
think that you could

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,625
escape me for long?

Ahh... Another
Dragon Ball.

you've joined forces with them?

[BULMA] Yoo-hoo!

76
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,875
Thank you for
coming to rescue me!

Those two don't
concern me.

80
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,958
All I want to know
is what you did

81
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,958
with the rest of
the Dragon Balls.

82
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,250
You can either tell me
or you can tell Frieza.

83
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,708
Your choice!

84
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,000

me talk!

With pleasure...

87
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:42,041
Well, get on with your
little transformation then.

88
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,458
You know perfectly well that
you can't possibly defeat me

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,041
unless you change into
that hideous creature.

Alright...
Now you've done it!

91
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,416
No one insults me
like that, Vegeta!

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,625
And for someone who
looks like you,

93
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,041
you have no right
to call me hideous!

94
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,625
I'd kill you
where you stand,

95
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,541
but Frieza wants me
to take you alive.

Consider
yourself lucky...

97

Ha! The only thing I'm going
to consider is how much pain

I make you endure before I end
your pathetic little life.

the villagers

threw this Dragon
Ball in the lake...

146

Maybe they knew that
Vegeta was coming

00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,375
so they hid it
down there!
