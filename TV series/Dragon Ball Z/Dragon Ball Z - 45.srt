1
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,375
more visitors arrived
on Planet Namek.

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,416
[KRILLIN] It looks
like a Saiyan ship!

4
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,583
[BULMA whimpering]

5
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,291
It's Vegeta!
It's gotta be.

6
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
Rrrgh... Raagh!

7
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,416
[NARRATOR]
Vegeta landed on Namek

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
with only one thing
on his mind:

9
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,166
Revenge.

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,958
[VEGETA] My time
has finally come.

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm about to remove the only
obstacle standing in my way.

12
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
[BULMA squealing]

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,625
W-Was that Vegeta's
ship again?

14
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,125
[FRIEZA laughing]

15
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,875
Heh, heh...

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,041
[NARRATOR] The young
adventurers have no idea

17
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,666
that the mighty Frieza
is also on the planet

18
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,208
and in possession of four
of the Dragon Balls.

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,541
Now, their simple mission
is moving quickly

20
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,166
into messy territory.

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,875
Stay tuned for
Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,083
[BULMA sighing heavily]

23
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,708
This may be the most
depressing day of my life...

24
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,875
Yeah, today isn't
starting off too well.

25
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
So, what do
you think, huh?

26
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,958
[KRILLIN] Who could have been
in that second ship?

27
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,708
[GOHAN] Hmm...

28
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
[HENCHMAN]
For you, Lord Frieza.

29
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,125
Very good.
Only three more to go.

30
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,791
[chuckling]

31
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,458
Guard them
carefully, Dodoria.

32
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,833
Vegeta wants them,
and I'd rather not

33
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,416
waste any time hunting
them down again.

34
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,333
Lord Frieza,
Cui has just arrived.

35
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,958
He's been
tracking Vegeta,

36
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,458
so we should know his exact
whereabouts soon enough.

37
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,333
Also, those small power
levels we noticed earlier

38
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,750
appear to
have vanished.

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,000
However, it's unlikely
they've traveled far

40
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,000
from their last
known position.

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,750
I've already sent out two
scouts to search the area.

42
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,666
Whoever it is, they won't be
able to hide from us for long.

43
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,875
Fine. But I don't want my
scouts chasing apparitions

44
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,625
when they could be helping
to search for Vegeta.

45
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,458
Yes, I understand your
concern, Lord Frieza.

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,291
And I would agree,
if I didn't believe Cui

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,458
was more than capable of
handling the job on his own.

48
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,708
His power level is much
higher than Vegeta's.

49
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,583
I don't think you'll
have to worry about seeing

50
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,416
that monkey-tailed
abomination again.

51
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,166
Ahh... There you are.

52
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,375
[CUI laughing]

53
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,083
Hello, Vegeta.

54
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,458
Do you read me?
Fair warning...

55
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm coming for you.

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,750
And I'm brining a little
message from Lord Frieza!

57
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,750
So, you've been following
me, have you Cui?

58
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,041
Well, I have a message
you can take to Frieza.

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
His days are numbered,
as are yours!

60
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,833
[CUI laughing]

61
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,750
[CUI] Take a good look
at your scouter.

62
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,583
My power level is way
higher than yours!

63
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,583
[CUI chuckling]

64
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,375
[CUI] You arrogant Saiyan.

65
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,875
It's about time someone
put you in your place.

66
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,708
[GOHAN] What are we
supposed to do now?!

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,125
Well, it's not doing us any
good just sitting here.

68
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,625
So it's settled! We'll
stick to the original plan!

69
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,791
I'll hurry back to
Earth and get Goku!

70
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,291
You guys
have the radar,

71
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,000
so you shouldn't
have any trouble!

72
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,791
See you in
two months!

73
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,750
Hold on, Bulma. 
Give us a second.

74
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,208
Ahh...

75
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,708
Ah?!

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,875
[KRILLIN] Uhh...

77
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,875
So, um, Gohan.

78
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,875
Hmm?

79
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,875
Whaddaya say you and me,
well, maybe we should go, too?

80
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,583
Wha--?

81
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,041
Hmm?

82
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,208
Hey, c'mon! Two enemy
ships have already landed.

83
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,708
Even with the Dragon Radar,
the odds are stacked against us.

84
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,583
It might be best
to cut our losses.

85
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,916
I'm not saying I'm
scared or anything,

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,541
I'm just lookin'
out for Gohan!

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,041
ChiChi would kill me
if I let him get hurt!

88
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,375
But, we can't
just leave now.

89
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,875
If we do, then Vegeta will
get all of the Dragon Balls.

90
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,125
Uhh. Yeah, well, uh... Maybe
we should let him have 'em.

91
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,875
I mean, we can always
try again next year!

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,250
That's not funny,
Krillin.

93
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,458
You know what kind of
damage he can do with them.

94
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
We're talking
about Vegeta.

95
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,041
Krillin, look!
Someone's coming!

96
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,916
Hmm?

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,625
Ahh!

98
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,416
[BULMA squeals]

99
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,666
Is it...
Vegeta?

100
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,916
Don't think so...

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,833
This energy level feels
way too low to be his.

102
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,791
Keep your
eyes peeled.

103
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,875
They should be right
around here somewhere.

104
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,416
I bet it
was a native.

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,250
[BULMA]
Who are they?

106
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,833
Let's hope
they're Namekians.

107
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,166
[BOTH scream]

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,625
Those are definitely
not Namekians!

109
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,916
Hey, who's that?

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,791
Whoever they are,
they're not from around here.

111
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,666
Looks like we get to
have ourselves some fun.

112
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,583
Zarbon said if
they're not Nameks,

113
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,208
we don't even have to question
'em before we kill 'em.

114
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,916
[laughing]

115
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,416
Check out what
they're wearing!

116
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,833
That's weird, it
looks like they're

117
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,833
wearing Saiyan
battle uniforms.

118
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,583
But they
aren't Saiyans.

119
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,375
What are they?

120
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,458
I guess they're hired
muscle or something, but...

121
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,791
Either way,
it's not good.

122
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,375
They sure don't
look friendly.

123
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,333
Aren't you two
gonna do something?

124
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,166
You've gotta
protect me!

125
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,458
Gohan. Keep your
energy suppressed

126
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,125
until we know what
we're dealing with here.

127
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,666
All right.

128
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,250
[SCOUT B laughing]

129
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,708
This will be easy.

130
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,000
Their power levels
are almost non-existent.

131
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,875
They're
probably tourists.

132
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,416
Heh, heh, heh. Let's attack
their ship first.

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,125
It would be a shame
for them to get away

134
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,875
before we
have our fun.

135
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,375
Sounds good!

136
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,791
[BULMA screams]

137
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,000
No! Not
the ship!

138
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,833
[SCOUT A laughing]

139
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,000
[SCOUT B] Did I destroy
your precious ship?

140
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
Please forgive me!

141
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,666
Well, I think
I've seen enough.

142
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,333
Time for us to do some
serious powering up!

143
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,125
Hmm!

144
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
[GOHAN growls]

145
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,458
Hey, take a
look at that.

146
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,583
Looks like
the little one

147
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,708
is having stomach
cramps or something!

148
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,458
[SCOUT B] Huh?

149
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:39,625
[BOTH laughing]

150
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,333
[SCOUT B] Huh?

151
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,875
Wait! Hold on!

152
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,166
Their power reading
just skyrocketed!

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,375
[BOTH whimpering]

154
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,666
Let's do it!

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,125
Yeah!

156
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,958
[SCOUTS yelling]

157
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,416
[GOHAN] Haah!

158
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,208
[KRILLIN] Raah!

159
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,750
[GOHAN] Ha-ha!

160
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,333
[KRILLIN laughing]

161
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,333
That was easy
enough, huh?

162
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,875
Don't look
so happy!

163
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,000
[BULMA quietly sobbing]

164
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,416
--[BULMA] Our poor ship.
--[KRILLIN] What's wrong?

165
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,125
[BULMA] How are we
supposed to get home now?

166
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:34,166
Zarbon, what is it?
Something's troubling you.

167
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,875
It's the search
party we sent out.

168
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,750
Both of our scouts stopped
transmitting at the same time.

169
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,041
I realize those scouts
weren't the best that we had,

170
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,791
but it still worries me that
they were defeated so quickly.

171
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,375
Whoever is responsible
for this attack

172
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,541
knows what they're doing, and
they seem to have the ability

173
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,916
to suppress their power.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,875
Well. That's
very interesting.

175
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,750
But why are you wasting my
time with these things?

176
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,208
The two unknown power levels
came in at fifteen hundred.

177
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,583
It's possible Vegeta has brought
with him some extra help.

178
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,458
Only fifteen hundred?

179
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,583
That means nothing to me,
nor should it to you.

180
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,666
Just concentrate on
retrieving the Dragon Balls

181
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,541
and we'll be on our way.

182
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,583
They'll be dealt with when
I destroy this puny planet.

183
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:52,708
[GOKU quietly grunting]

184
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,041
[thinking] Yes...
Just a little more.

185
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,666
[grunting continues]

186
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,791
[water bubbling]

187
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,666
[GOKU] Ngh!

188
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,458
[CHICHI] Goku?

189
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,416
Uh... ChiChi?

190
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,375
Honey, what
are you doing?

191
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,208
[GOKU chuckling sheepishly]

192
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,166
Well, I was bored,
so I started to, uh--

193
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,791
Goku, really.

194
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,083
Why can't you understand
that you're badly wounded?

195
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,041
You need to
stay in bed.

196
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,791
Look at you.
Your hair is all wet.

197
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,291
You don't want to catch
a cold now, do you?

198
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:46,666
[GOKU wailing]

199
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,708
I hope Gohan is taking
good care of his hair

200
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,791
like I
asked him to.

201
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,041
That boy's
hair is so fine

202
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,875
that he has to keep up
with washing it daily.

203
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,541
I wonder if he's
using the conditioner

204
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,000
I gave him
before he left?

205
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,250
I don't want him
coming back to Earth

206
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,333
with a frizzy mop
on top of his head.

207
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,083
And he better not be
using his hair dryer,

208
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,541
because that will
only make it worse.

209
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,500
His scalp is already
dry enough as it is.

210
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,666
[thinking] Gohan, I sure
hope you're doing okay.

211
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,458
[BULMA whimpering]

212
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,416
It's no use! We'll never
get back to Earth!

213
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,583
We'll be stuck on this
planet for eternity!

214
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,583
[KRILLIN] Come on, Bulma.
We need to get out of here.

215
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,500
Whoever is sending those
scouts knows our location now,

216
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,291
and there's bound to
be more on the way.

217
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,333
Don't worry, Bulma.

218
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,833
I'll bet if we find
some Namekians

219
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,666
they can help us
repair the ship.

220
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,958
We're not going to be
stuck here. I promise.

221
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,666
We'll make it back
to Earth somehow.

222
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,791
Okay.

223
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,791
He's right.
We'll find a way.

224
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,375
We just have to
keep our cool.

225
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,166
That was the first
thing Piccolo taught me:

226
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,750
Never panic!

227
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,125
Oh, sure...
Easy for you to say!

228
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,000
[BULMA crying]

229
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,458

Hah!
It's about time.

long enough.

So nice to
see you, Vegeta.

You have no
idea how much

235

I've looked
forward to this.

The day when I
would get to wipe

that smug little smirk
off your face forever.

You should have never
defied Lord Frieza.

Oh, we'll
see about that.

don't get it, do you?

I'm through
taking orders.

It's time Lord Frieza
started bowing to me.

[CUI] You're old news, Vegeta.

You turned on Frieza and you'll
pay for it with your life.

but not today.

[growling continues]

250
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,958
That's right! I've been
suppressing my power.

251
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,541
It's a little trick
I learned on Earth.

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,541
Impossible! Your power level
was never anywhere near mine!

Idiot! Do you really believe
that you can keep up

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,875
with my experience
in battle?

255
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,458
I am constantly fighting
on the front lines.

I have been to the brink
of death and back again!

Meanwhile,
you've been hiding

never seen a reading that high!

[shouting continues]

262
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,458
Zarbon. What happened?

263
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,500
I don't know. It must be
some kind of malfunction.

264
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,916
For a second there,
it registered

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,708
Vegeta's power level at 22,000,
and then it shorted out.

22,000? You've got
to be kidding me.

It must be that older
scouter model you're using.

Let me check
it on mine.

The number?

270
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,041
It... doesn't make
any sense.

271
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,458
This stupid thing
can't be right!

272
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,750
Now it's reading
twenty-four thousand!

273
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,041
Twenty-four?

274
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
Are you sure you're
reading that thing right?

275
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,208
It would mean Vegeta's power
level is even higher than ours!

276
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,583
I'm sure! It must be
some kind of a trick.

277
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,541
He's never been
above 18,000...

278
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,791
[FRIEZA] Is it really
so surprising?

279
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,125
Don't forget
that Vegeta

280
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,708
has been in heavy
combat for a while now.

281
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,416
With all the
fighting he's done,

282
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,666
especially on Earth,

283
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,833
he must have picked up
some new techniques.

284
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, but...

285
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,083
But nothing. There's
no need for concern.

286
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,916
It's only 24,000.

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,125
And while that may seem
impressive to some,

288
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,541
compared to me,
it's still insignificant.

289

[FRIEZA laughing]

290
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,916
[FRIEZA] Why do you think
Vegeta is so desperate

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,458
for the
Dragon Balls?

292
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,625
Hmm? I'll tell you.
He knows that without them,

293
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,791
he doesn't stand a
chance against me.

294
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,750
That's why he went to
Earth against my orders.

295
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,583
And that's why he's come
to this wretched planet.

296
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,958
He's been secretly
plotting to overthrow me,

297
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,583
biding his time, waiting for
his opportunity to strike.

298
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,041
And now, with the hope of
the Dragon Balls in sight,

299
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,583
he dares to
oppose me openly.

300
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,791
That stupid,
arrogant fool...

301
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,625
I am going to enjoy making
an example out of him.

302
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,291
Wait! Hold on, Vegeta!
I thought of a great idea!

303
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:43,041
I could join forces with you!
I never liked Frieza anyway...

304
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,750
And with both of us
working together,

305
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,666
we can take Zarbon and
Dodoria, no problem!

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,833
Think about it, Vegeta!

307
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,416
We've fought so much that we
know each other's moves

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
like the back
of our hands.

309
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,875
We'd make a
fantastic team!

like a pathetic fool, Cui.

makes me sick.

317
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
Huh? What?

318
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,625
Idiot!

319
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,208
[CUI] Ah-ha!

320
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,958
Rraaagh!

321
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,708
Huh...?

322
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:52,333
[CUI laughing]

323
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,375
He should've taken my
advice back on Planet Frieza.

324
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
I tried talking
some sense into him,

325
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,541
but, oh well...

326
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,583
[VEGETA] Is that so?

327
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,166
Huh?! Aaah!

328
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,833
Apparently your idea of advice
is to submit to my adversary,

329
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,500
and you know
I won't do that.

330
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,166
How'd you
escape that?!

331
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,416
Once again you've
underestimated your enemy,

332
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Cui, and you won't be walking
away from this mistake.

333
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,500
But--! I--Aah!

334
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,041
What happened to
all that confidence

335
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,541
you had built up
for yourself?

336
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,541
It doesn't seem to
be working anymore.

337
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,791
[CUI whimpering]

338
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,250
[CUI] Aah!

339
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,708
[VEGETA growling]

340
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,083
[CUI screams]

341
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,541
[VEGETA] Rrrgh...

342
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,000
Raah!

343
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,500
[VEGETA] Heh, heh...

344
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,250
Goodbye.

345
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,958
See you in hell, Cui.

346
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,875
It looks like Zarbon
was right after all.

347
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,500
We really underestimated
Vegeta's power level.

348
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,625
He destroyed Cui in
a matter of seconds!

349
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,000
[FRIEZA] There's still nothing
to be concerned about.

350
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,833
Continue your search
for the Dragon Balls.

351
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,541
That's all
that matters.

352
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,250
[thinking] I'm sure
they've sensed my energy

353
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,625
through their scouters,

354
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,833
so they know I'm here. I can
take Zarbon and Dodoria,

355
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,791
I'm confident of that.
But Frieza...

356
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,416
Frieza is still
much too powerful.

357
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,833
I can't risk a
direct confrontation

358
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,875
until I've collected
all seven Dragon Balls.

359
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,083
Wait, of course! Without
all seven, they're useless.

360
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,833
Which means, if I
can find just one,

361
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,625
Frieza won't be able
to make his wish.

362
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,125
[VEGETA chuckling]

363
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
And then, after
he and his goons

364
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,375
have gone to all the trouble
of collecting all six,

365
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,750
I'll sneak in
and take them

366
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,000
right from under
their noses...

367
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,041
[laughing]

368
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,250
[thinking] Ah, yes...

369
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,125
I can almost feel my
immortality already.

370
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,875
Lord Frieza, we've
detected a group of Nameks,

371
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,500
not far in
that direction.

372
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,416
Well, that's good news.

373
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,791
And with any luck, they'll
have the fifth Dragon Ball

374
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,041
in their possession.

375
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,625
I'm sure we can convince
them to part with it.

376
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,083
But stay on
your guard.

377
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,000
We have a few troublesome
little pests lurking about.

378
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,708
Yes. Right.

379
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,833
[FRIEZA]
Very well. Let's go.

380
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,375
That's it, Frieza. Find
those Dragon Balls for me.

381
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,083
Each one you gather brings you
one step closer to your doom!

382
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,500
[VEGETA laughing]

383
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
Come on, Bulma.
Let's pick up the pace.

384
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,625
They'll catch us if we
don't find a place to hide.

385
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,208
[BULMA panting]

386
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,625
You guys can fly, can't you?
Why don't you just carry me?

387
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,250
Well, you know
we would, Bulma,

388
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,833
but, when we fly, it puts
out way too much energy.

389
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
Sorry, but they'd pick
up our power levels

390
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,416
on their scouters
for sure,

391
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,083
and then they'd know
exactly where to find us!

392
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,416
[BULMA screams]

393
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,791
[KRILLIN] Hey, look!

394
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,125
I found a cave.

395
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,291
It should be a great spot
to lie low for a while.

396
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,041
You're kidding,
right, Krillin?

397
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,208
You can't expect me
to live in that hole.

398
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,916
[BULMA sobbing]

399
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:24,875
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin...?

400
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:25,958
Huh?

401
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,375
Are you sensing that?
That energy...

402
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,666
Think so.
It feels pretty strong,

403
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,416
and it's
still rising.

404
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,875
I don't know.
Whoever that is, it's--

405
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,375
Hmm! Ah!

406
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,166
Trouble! Everyone get into
the cave and hide, right now!

407
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,875
[NARRATOR] Once again,
our heroes find themselves

408
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,166
standing directly
in danger's path.

409
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,083
But for now, they are
still in the dark

410
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,541
as to the identity of
the approaching foe...

411
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,333
Could it be Vegeta? Or is it
someone far more sinister?

412
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,916
Find out...
Next Dragon Ball Z!
