00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,625
As the two evil Saiyan
warriors hurtled towards Earth

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,208
in their space pods,

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,708
the Z warriors
were busy

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,041
beefing up their
martial arts skills.

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,500
Goku had made it to
King Kai's planet

7
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,916
but he was finding the gravity
a little tough to take.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,333
And it didn't
help matters

9
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,958
when he mistook the
King's pet ape Bubbles

10
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,708
for the mythical
martial master...

11
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,666
Once the proper
introductions were made,

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,166
Goku was put to the test to
see if he was worthy enough

13
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,625
to train with the
legendary King Kai...

14
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,708
His first assignment,
catch Bubbles,

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,375
and then he would be
permitted to move on

16
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,166
to the next phase
of his training...

17
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,208
It all seemed easy
enough at first,

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,916
but it proved to be a lot
harder than Goku imagined.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,250
That little monkey
sure could move!

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
And don't forget the intense
gravity of King Kai's planet.

21
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,875
It can really
bring a guy down!

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,708
While King Kai watched with
amusement from the sidelines,

23
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,541
Goku did his best to grab
the speedy little monkey!

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,916
Time and time again they
traveled around the planet

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,583
and before long they
were going in circles!

26
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,375
Then Goku made one
last leap of faith

27
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,500
and managed to get
a grip on Bubbles!

28
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
[GOKU] Heh. Gotcha! Yeah!

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,666
[NARRATOR] It was then that
King Kai realized that Goku

30
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,625
could indeed be
a worthy student.

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,958
But things are only going to
get harder from here on in...

32
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,791
And one question
remains...

33
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,750
What kind of
bizarre training

34
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,333
does the King have in
store for Goku now?

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,625
[GOKU] Woo-hoo! I did it!
I caught him! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

36
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,916
Look King Kai!
I caught the monkey!

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,958
[BUBBLES chatters]

38
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,458
I'm ready for the next phase
of my training King Kai!

39
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
Okay... If you say so.

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,625
Let's see now...
Phase two, huh?

41
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,625
Yeah!

42
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,500
No more
monkey business!

43
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,625
[snickers]

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,250
Heh!

45
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,125
[kissing sounds]

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,041
Can I do my next training
session without Bubbles?

47
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,708
He'll just
get in the way!

48
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,208
Hey! Don't be so rude!

49
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,166
All right then!
Let's start training!

50
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,125
Yeah! Let's get to work!

51
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,541
[long inhale]

[intense yelling]

53
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,000
Hm?

54
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,833
What did you do?

55
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,750
I yelled at the
top of my lungs!

56
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,166
Yeah, I'll say...

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,333
Um... Am I missing
something here?

58
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,458
Why did you do that, King Kai?

59
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,958
You'll see...

60
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,916
[GOKU] Uh...

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,416
[intense yelling]

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,166
That, my boy, is a
long distance call!

63
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,666
[snickers]

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
Don't you get it?

65
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,208
He can't be a
martial arts master!

66
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,916
[GREGORY]
Hey! I heard that!

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,083
Huh?

[GOKU yells]

69
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,625
What is it?

70
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,958
[GREGORY] I'm not an
it, you lunk-head!

71
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,458
Hey! It's a little
grasshopper man!

72
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,083
Yeah! So what?

73
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,875
Little grasshopper man?

[KING KAI snickers]

75
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,083
Be quiet!
And listen up!

76
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,333
My name's Gregory!

77
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,791
And I'm King Kai's most
trusted attendant!

78
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,208
So you watch
yourself!

79
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,250
Uhh...

80
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,083
That's right!
I'm also a fearless

81
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,500
martial arts master
with no equal!

82
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,875
Except for King Kai!

[KING KAI snickers]

84
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,500
[KING KAI] I think it's
your ego that has no equal!

85
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,750
A-hem. Yes, now
where was I?

86
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,958
Right! Who do you
think you are?

87
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,250
I heard what you
said about King Kai!

88
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,000
So you don't think
he's for real, huh?

89
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,250
No! His methods
just bug me!

90
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,625
[KING KAI growls]

91
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,500
[KING KAI] Heh! Oh, I get it!
My methods bug him!

[KING KAI snickers]

93
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,958
King Kai? Please! It's hard to
concentrate with you laughing!

94
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,291
Yes, of course!
Sorry about that!

95
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,750
Goku, Gregory will be your
next test! Are you ready?

96
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,291
The bug?

97
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,416
Hey, buddy,
I'm a grasshopper!

98
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,666
But King Kai...

99
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,666
I thought you were going
to train me personally?

100
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,833
You'll take on just about
anyone these days, won't you?

101
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,875
How am I supposed to work
with a guy like this

102
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,041
who doesn't know
the first thing

103
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,916
about showing respect
for his elders?!

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,333
You'll manage!

105
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,291
Now let's
get started!

106
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,875
What's that for?

107
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:50,416
That's kinda big! Are you sure
you're not overdoing it, sir?

108
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,375
Of course not!

Now Goku.
Take that hammer

114
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,833
and see if you can
hit Gregory with it!

115
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,458
Hit him? Uhh...

116
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,333
And if you can
complete this task

117

I will allow you to
train under me directly!

Don't get your
hopes up, buddy!

There's no way I'm gonna let
you hit me with that hammer!

about them, King Kai?

does he know about them?

am I correct?

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,833
Huh?!

227
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,333
Yeah! But I don't know
anything about the Saiyans...

228
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,416
You see, they sent me to
Earth when I was just a baby!

229
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,416
Ah, well then... I can probably
tell you a few things

230
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,125
about the Saiyans
that you don't know!

231

[GOKU]

00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,875
[GOKU] Mm-hm...

237
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:13,166
Mm. Yes... Now a long time ago,
before you were born...

238
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,125
There were two tribes
that lived on Planet Vegeta.

239
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,416
There were your
ancestors, the Saiyans...

240
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,166
And the other tribe was
known as the Tuffles.

241
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,833
[GOKU] The Saiyans
and the Tuffles, huh?

242
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,375
[KING KAI] That's correct.
Now, the Tuffles

243
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,875
were a so-called
advanced civilization...

244
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,083
They had cities much
like the ones on Earth

245
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,000
and enjoyed all of
the modern conveniences

246
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,416
such as air-travel
and mini malls.

247
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,958
They had long ago
outgrown energy sources

248
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,125
which polluted
their planet

249
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,250
and were enjoying
health and prosperity.

250
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,125
Not far from the big cities, in
the arid wastelands of Vegeta,

251
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,541
the Saiyans lived in
primitive fashion.

252
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,125
They were much larger in
size than the Tuffles

253
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,791
but much smaller
in number.

254
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
One thing all Saiyans
had in common

255
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,500
was that they
all had tails.

256
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,250
Another was their brutal
and violent nature...

257
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,708
They loved to fight.

258
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,000
But because they were
so few in number,

259
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,500
the Tuffles never worried
about the Saiyans.

260
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,208
That is until the day...

261
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,916
...they attacked!

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,583
And so the great war for
planet Vegeta began.

263
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,583
With the element of
surprise in their favor,

264
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,708
the Saiyans quickly
gained a strong foothold

265
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,708
in the war against
the Tuffles.

266
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
The Tuffles had
technology on their side.

267
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,500
They had devices that measured
their enemies fighting power

268
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,708
and advanced
weaponry

269
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,708
which they used to hold
the Saiyans at bay.

270
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Though few in number,

271
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,416
the Saiyans strength
was so incredible

272
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,333
that they too won their
fair share of the battles.

273
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,833
[SAIYAN #2 laughs]

274
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,541
[KING KAI] And just when it
seemed that there was

275
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,708
no end in sight to
this horrible war,

276
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,333
something
happened on Vegeta

277
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,875
that only happens there
once every eight years.

278
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,333
There was a full moon!

279
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,583
A decisive factor in the
war for planet Vegeta!

280
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,666
As you must know, Saiyans
have the ability to transform

281
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,875
into huge ape-like creatures
when the moon is full.

282
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,083
[roaring]

283
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
[TUFFLE #2]
Let's get out of here!

284
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,458
[roaring]

285
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,458
[KING KAI] It didn't take long
for these monsters to destroy

286
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,791
the Tuffles and their
advanced civilization...

287
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,791
But then a new problem
began for the Saiyans.

288
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,916
Without the technology
of the Tuffles,

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,125
the Saiyans couldn't
travel in space.

290
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,666
This meant they couldn't
satisfy the one desire

291
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,666
that they all shared,
the desire to fight.

292
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,958
I'm sure you've
heard the joke,

293
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,458
how many Saiyans does it
take to build a rocket-ship?

294
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
[GOKU] Uh? No...

295
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,000
[KING KAI chuckles]

296
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,125
It's a really good one!

297
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,458
[GOKU]
Later King Kai!

298
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,958
[KING KAI] Fine!
Well, not far away,

299
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,958
the Saiyans met
the Archosians...

300
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,750
Now, the Archosians had
money and technology,

301
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,541
but the planet
Archos was a dump.

302
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,041
So they hired the Saiyans to
conquer a planet for them!

303
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,500
An unholy partnership
was formed.

304
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,166
With Saiyan might and
Archosian ingenuity combined,

305
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,833
they formed a fleet
of planet pirates.

306
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,625
The plan that these
two sinister races

307
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,166
hatched meant that
there was nothing

308
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,958
they wouldn't do to
achieve their goals...

309
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,458
An armada of space pods
was designed to travel

310
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,708
the vast distances
of the universe.

311
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,666
They even sent babies like
yourself to distant planets.

312
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,458
The Saiyan leaders were more
than happy to send specimens

313
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
of their race into
the great unknown.

314
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,458
They knew that when
the babies grew up

315
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
they would extinguish
any and all inhabitants

316
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,125
of the planet
they landed on.

317
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,333
I'd like to
extinguish them!

318
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,791
Well, all misdeeds gather
their just rewards.

319
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,416
You see, like Earth, the planet
Vegeta also had a guardian.

320
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,416
This good man
used his power

321
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,333
to attract a vast system
of meteors to the planet.

322
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,416
He could no longer tolerate
the horrible burden

323
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,291
of the Saiyans'
dark deeds.

324
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,750
So he brought destruction
upon the planet,

325
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,208
which was plagued by the weight
of its inhabitants' evil.

326
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,875
Planet Vegeta
was demolished!

327
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,500
It kind of got a major
spanking you could say,

328
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
except with meteors.

329
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,625
Only four Saiyans
survived the destruction

330
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
of planet Vegeta,

331
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,833
and you are
one of them.

332
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,333
No!

333
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm not one of them!
I'll never be!

334
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,291
[KING KAI]
Easy now...

335
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,625
Listen you might despise your
heritage, but at this point

336
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,833
the fact that you are a
Saiyan is a great asset!

337
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,833
Channel your anger. Use it
to enhance your training.

338
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,791
You're right! I can't wait
to start training again.

339
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,208
I'm in! If it's okay
with King Kai of course!

340
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,875
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

341
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,625
[GOKU] I am really
anxious to get started,

342
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,041
but uh, let me wolf
this down first!

343
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,291
[eating noises]

344
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,375
[GOKU thinking]
C'mon... C'mon...

345
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,416
[GREGORY] Huh?!

346
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,458
[GOKU thinking]
Missed him!

347
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,708
[KAMI] Gentlemen, Mr. Popo
and I are both very pleased

348
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,625
with the progress
you have made here.

349
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,416
Each of you has
reached a new level

350
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,375
of strength
and technique.

351
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,833
But the time has come for you
to go back down to Earth.

352
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,875
The future of the planet
is in your hands.

353
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,625
May you fight
with honor!

354
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,000
[ALL] Right!

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,375
Kami, can I take these
weighted clothes off now?

356
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,041
You may do
as you please.

357
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,500
So what are you guys
going to do down below?

358
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,416
Well, I say we go somewhere
and continue training.

359
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,916
That's a
good idea.

360
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,708
[thinking] Hm. I wonder how
much Goku has improved...

361
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,250
[GOKU]
Ha, ha, ha! I got you now!

362
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,500
[GREGORY]
Oh, no you don't!

363
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
[clanking]

364
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,166
[KING KAI]
What a mess!

365
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,750
I hope my insurance covers this!

366
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
[GREGORY laughs]

367
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,333
[thinking]
I almost got him!

368
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,875
Hm. That was a close one!

369
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,958
Yeah!

370
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,208
That oughta do it!

371
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,083
Aahh!

372
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,000
Aahh!

373
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
All right!
Here goes!

374
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,833
Gotcha!

375
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,333
[BUBBLES chatters]

376
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,916
That wasn't too bad
now was it, Gregory?

377
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,250
What is that, a joke? Come on
my body is in super condition!

378
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,666
You couldn't hurt me with
that thing if you tried!

379
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,583
Really? Well, is
that a lump I see?

380
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,041
Oh! What did
you do to me?

381
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,666
[GOKU laughs]

382
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,875
[thinking] Goku is
indeed a rare man.

383
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,500
Perhaps he
is the one!

384
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,958
There are seventy days left.
He could do it!

385
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,541
He could master Kaio-Ken and
defeat those Saiyan warriors!

386
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,458
No one's ever been able
to master Kaio-Ken.

387
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,166
It's been like a
dream in my head.

388
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,875
Like a horse that's
too wild to ride!

389
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,458
But now,
there is a chance!

390
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,375
King Kai you
promised remember?

391
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,250
Do you really think
you're ready to learn

392
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,416
the mystic art of Kaio-Ken
from me as you are?

393
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, do you?

394
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,625
Yes, I do!

395
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,416
All right, first I want
you to visualize yourself

396
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,666
at your very best! Both in
body and in spirit! Got it?

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,208
Got it!

398
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Now that you understand, uh...
let's go take a lunch break!

399
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,958
[ROSHI] Well sis, I should
know better then to ask but,

400
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,250
can you tell us what
your crystal ball says

401
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,625
about the future?

402

Who's future?
Be specific!

403
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,541
Our planet's future...
Mother Earth's!

Hm. What's up?
You heard something?

405
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,250
No matter!

406
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,666
If it's going to
happen, I'll see it!

407
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,333

[NARRATOR] While our heroes
push themselves to the limit

416
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,166
with their
martial arts training,

417
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,500
on the outer edge
of the solar system,

418
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,375
a great evil
approaches.

00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,125
The Saiyans, who are intent
on destroying Earth,

420
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,625
are already
passing by Jupiter.

Only one day remains
until their arrival.

422
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,375
Have the Z warriors properly
prepared themselves

423
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,541
to face
their wrath?

424
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
And will Goku make
it back in time

425
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,375
to fight side by side
with his son Gohan?

All these questions and
more will be answered

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
