1
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,750
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,750
Gohan endured his most
severe training session yet!

3
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,458
And though the young fighter
showed vast improvement,

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
Piccolo wasn't
about to let up!

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,375
So you figured out how to
dodge my punches and kicks...

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,083
Now try this!

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,583
[GOHAN yells]

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,666
[NARRATOR] But Piccolo's seeming
cruelty was not without purpose.

9
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,333
For the veteran warrior
understood all too well...

10
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,583
The enemy they were
both preparing to face

11
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,666
would employ tactics
far more ruthless.

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,583
It's a lesson the rest
of the Z-Fighters

13
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,250
had also
taken to heart!

14
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,250
To survive the battle
against the Saiyans,

15
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,375
they knew they would have to
hone their fighting skills

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,125
to their highest
levels ever.

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:00,291
And under the watchful eye
of Kami, they did just that!

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,000
Meanwhile, far away
in Other World,

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,958
Goku continued
to sail through

20
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,166
King Kai's tests of strength
with flying colors!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,208
And after months of
difficult training,

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:16,333
it seems the student has
finally surpassed the teacher!

23
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,250
Goku's strength
and speed

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,916
may have him running
circles around King Kai,

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,625
but the
question is:

26
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:29,083
Will his newfound powers be
enough to stop the Saiyans?

27
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,500
The time to find out
is drawing near.

28
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,791
The two evil Saiyans are on
their final approach to Earth!

29
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,583
The invasion begins...
Today!

30
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,000
[KING KAI]
Goku, this will be

31
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,166
the last day of your
training with me.

32
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
You've done well,

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,375
but I'm afraid you're
lacking in one area...

34
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,791
You still can't seem
to deliver a good joke

35
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,708
when the
pressure's on!

36
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,125
Everything else is good...

37
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,458
Let's review!

38
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,125
[GOKU] Hm!

39
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,916
[KING KAI]
'Kay... Bubbles, you're up!

second! A new record!

[GOKU chuckles]

46

Next...

47

Alright! Ha, ha!

A-Astounding!

Hey, thanks!

55
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:20,500
Well, okay! Now it's time
to test the Spirit Bomb!

56
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,583
I've been
waiting for this!

57

[BUBBLES chatters lightly]

[KING KAI] Excellent.
Now form it into a ball.

00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,291
Hm. Alright! Here goes!

Remember, Goku! Don't use
your eyes, feel it out!

00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,250
[GOKU]
Right!

Oohhh!

00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,083
Yahh!

70
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,833
[yelling]

71
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,083
[GOKU chuckles]

72
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:25,333
Ohhh! I can't
believe it!

73
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,458
Well done, Goku!

74
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,625
To be perfectly honest,

75
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,291
I didn't think you'd
be able to handle

76
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,416
the Spirit Bomb
so skillfully!

77
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,000
It wasn't easy.

78
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,166
Mm. Goku, you
mustn't forget...

79
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,333
The energy used to
form the Spirit Bomb

80
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,708
is gathered from
all forms of life.

81
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,958
From trees... From
animals... From plants...

82
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,375
Even the particles of energy
that make up the air

83
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,291
in the atmosphere contribute
a small share of energy

84
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,916
to the bomb. Therefore,
you must be very careful.

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,416
You see, you have
mastered the Spirit Bomb

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,583
here on this
small planet.

87
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
But the Spirit Bomb that
you will form on Earth,

88
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,208
with its innumerable
life forms,

89
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,666
will have immense power
compared to this small one.

90
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,500
And if the sun
happens to be up

91
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,166
when you form
the Spirit Bomb,

92
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,750
you will be harnessing and
trying to control a power

93
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,125
of indescribable
magnitude

94
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,666
that could easily
destroy the Earth

95
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,875
if even the slightest error
is made in handling it.

96
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,875
[GOKU] Hm.

97
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,833
[KING KAI] If possible,
I'd like you to refrain

98
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,458
from using
the Spirit Bomb...

99
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,875
But if you must, use
it only once. Understand?

100
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,166
Mm. Got it! I'll stick to
the Kaio-Ken Technique.

101
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,750
That should do it!

102
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,583
Well, I'm afraid the
time has finally come

103
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,583
for us to say
our goodbyes...

104
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,500
The Saiyans will be
arriving on Earth tomorrow.

105
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,000
[GOKU] Mm.

106
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,125
Baahh!

107
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,541
Oh, no!

108
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,458
Wh-What? What's wrong?

109
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
[KING KAI] I forgot to
include in my calculations

110
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,750
the time it's
going to take you

111
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,333
to get back to
Earth on Snake Way!

112
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,875
What?! But King Kai,

113
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,791
I thought that you were just
going to zap me back to Earth!

[KING KAI grunts]

115
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,208
What?! You've got to
be kidding me! Right?

116
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,833
It took me nearly a year
to get here, you know!

117
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,083
[KING KAI]
Yes! But, um...

118
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,750
After your training,
you'll be much faster!

119
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,875
You should be able to
make it back on Snake Way

120
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,750
within two days if
you go all out!

121
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,291
No! But that means I'll
get there a day late!

122
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,333
It'll all be over by then!
I can't do that!

123
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,666
That's enough, Goku!

124
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,375
I'm not perfect, now am I?
Even I make mistakes!

125
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,416
Now! Let's keep our cool so we
can take the next step! Alright?

126
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,416
You need to
tell your friends

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,250
to wish you
back to life!

128
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,541
What? Tell them?
But, they're not here!

129
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,125
Just put your
arm on my back!

130
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,041
Then speak to them
with your mind...

131
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,250
Your thoughts will get
through, don't worry!

132

Uh? Uh... Uh...

133
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,333
Uh... There?

134
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,125
[KING KAI]
Yes, yes, get on with it!

[GOKU telepathically]
Master Roshi?

136
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,166
Master Roshi, it's me, Goku.

137

Eh? Goku! It's you!
But where are you?

141

[GOKU telepathically] Well,
it's sort of a long story.

142
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,875
But I'm still dead,
if that's what you mean.

143
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm talking to you with my
mind from King Kai's planet.

144

Can you
hear me okay?

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,166
Yes, I can.

manage to collect all

Sure did! We're
ready when you are!

149

I understand that
you've been undergoing

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,458
some sort of
new training?

151
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,791
[GOKU telepathically]
Yeah, that's right!

152
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,375
And it's been going great!

153
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,625
But I've learned
all I can here,

154
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,041
and it's time
to come home.

155
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,791
I need you to wish me back
to life right away, okay?

156
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
Those two Saiyans
are going to arrive

on Earth
sometime tomorrow!

What?! When?!

But that can't be!

00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,666
I mean, has it been a year
already? Oh, this is bad...

And I won't be getting there

until the day
after tomorrow!

163

Somehow the others are going
to have to hold them off

164
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,208
until I get there!

[KING KAI grunts]

00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,000
Goku!
Ease up!

167
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,416
[GOKU] Huh?

168
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,666
I-I'm gonna pop!

169
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,416
Ah! Oh, sorry!

170
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,041
Hey, uh,
now listen...

171
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not sure how this
all going to turn out.

172
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,458
But I have a feeling it's going
to be some messy business.

I hope you're ready.

[GOKU telepathically]
I am. Don't worry.

00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:35,083
[ROSHI] Ahhh...
Well, that is a huge relief.

ya' what...

I, uh, I change
my mind, Bulma.

You can go next
if you want.

That's okay.

[toilet flushes]

00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,625
Hey, gang! Get the Dragon Balls!
I just talked to Goku!

[GROUP] Huh?!

King Kai! That was great!
I could hear him perfectly!

Heh, heh. Well, of course.

186

They're going
to wish me back.

Ah, good! Well,
while you're waiting,

188
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,416
I have a present
I'd like to give you.

189
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,416
We can't exactly have
you going into battle

looking all ragged
out now can we?

191
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,416
Wow! New clothes?

Hey! These clothes
are light as a feather!

195
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Yes, I thought
you'd like that...

196
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,708
The material is light,
but it's marvelously tough!

197
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
[GOKU]
It's incredible!

198
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,875
Those clothes repel
attacks, too... Small ones.

199
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,083
Thank you so much,
King Kai!

200
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,958
Ahh! Check it out! You left
the turtle emblem! Neat.

Although I was
hoping that since

I've been training
under you,

203

I'd get to wear your
symbol now. Y'know?

204
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,625
Look on the back!

205
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,041
Ahh! The back!

206
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,291
Heh, heh.
What's there? I can't see it!

207

Your old master's
emblem is on the front,

one on the back!

[snickers]

210
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,958
Great!

Go ahead! Don't just
dodge! Get inside!

[PICCOLO thinking] Darn it!
He surprised me...

218
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,333
That was a
reflex shot.

219
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,291
I didn't mean to
hit him so hard...

You said no eye-lasers.

And what if I did?!

You should never believe
anything the enemy tells you!

Yeah! But, I mean...
You're not the enemy.

Here goes!

tell me about it!

seen anything like it!

Yes, uh... 'Scuse me,
Mister Dragon,

destroy the Saiyans

Earth right about now?

Hey, Oolong!
That's not the wish!

What about Goku,
you little pig?

248
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,291
What? We could
wish Goku back!

249
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,958
But why not wish
him back next time

250
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:06,125
and have the Dragon
save the world now?

Your wish cannot
be granted.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,208
Because the guardian of
the Earth created me,

253
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,750
I cannot grant a wish
that exceeds his power.

Then I wish for Goku to
be brought back to life!

has been granted!

Ah!

are going to be here

those two Saiyans

to give you
a fair fight!

guard at all times!

kick 'em in the tail and run!

That Goku truly does have
some incredible powers...

Not only that, but his heart
is as pure as gold!

he was living down on Earth.

00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,208
took over the city?

320
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,750
[MAN 1]
Someone call the cops!

321
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
[MAN 2] Yeah, right!
What are they gonna do?

322
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,750
They'll just say it's
a weather balloon!

323
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,208
[WOMAN] There could be thousands
of tiny aliens in there!

324
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,791
[MAN 3] There's another
pod over here!

325
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,833
[WORKER]
Stay calm!

326
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,500
[MAN 1] Forget that!
I'm outta here!

327
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,708
Alien!

328
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,541
[screams and gasps]

329
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,458
[MAN 2]
He's getting out!

330
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,125
No! It can't be!

331
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,166
What do they want?

332
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,250
[NAPPA groans]

333
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,916
[NAPPA] My neck
is killing me...

334
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,083
So, the Saiyans
are here.

335
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,541
That means my Dad's gonna be
back soon, too... Doesn't it?

336
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,500
Uh?!

337
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,333
[CHIAOTZU]
Wow... You feel that?

338
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,541
Yeah. It's them...
Without a doubt!

339
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,166
[NAPPA chuckles]

340
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,500
[gasps and yells]

341
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,791
[gasps and yells]

342
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:37,208
Heh!

343
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,666
[NARRATOR]
After a year of waiting,

344
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,791
the countdown to doomsday
has finally expired!

345
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,458
The Saiyans have landed!

346
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,875
And unless Goku and his
friends can stop them,

347
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,416
they'll carve a
path of destruction

348
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,375
across the globe in their search
for the seven Dragon Balls!

349
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,750
Don't miss the
explosive confrontation...

350
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,666
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
