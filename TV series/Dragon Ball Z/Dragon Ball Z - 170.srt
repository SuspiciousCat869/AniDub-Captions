00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,708
Goku and Gohan headed home
after completing their training

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,958
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,500
Elsewhere, Cell was
doing his own training

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,541
to prepare for the approaching
Martial Arts Tournament.

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,000
As Vegeta quarreled
with the others over who

7
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,333
would get to train in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,041
Goku decided to take
a different approach!

9
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,833
[GOKU] Let's get your
Mom and go on home.

10
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,333
We'll have time to relax there.

11
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,833
I figure we'll have
three days of rest,

12
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,375
plus three days of training,

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,541
and then three more days of
rest before the tournament.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,166
[GOHAN] Hey, Dad. Can
I ask you something?!

15
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,875
--[GOKU] Hm?
--Well, I just wanna know...

16
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,125
Do you think we have
a chance to beat Cell?

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,875
[GOKU] Hey, let's not worry
about all that right now!

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,541
We've got nine days!
Let's kick back for a while!

19
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,125
[NARRATOR] And so Goku's
unusual training program began!

20
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,541
[GOHAN] Gosh! How nice!

21
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,125
[NARRATOR] The Super Saiyans'
stomachs have been filled,

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,000
and now it's time for
Gohan to do his chores!

23
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,125
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

24
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,833
[GIRL] Ahh! I see you!

25
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,500
[GIRL] C'mon!
Just a little closer!

26
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,208
[GIRL] You little rascal!

27
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,625
[GIRL screams]

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,416
[coughing, gasping]

29
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,375
Are you okay?

30
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,750
[GIRL screams]

31
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,708
How dare you?! You fiend!

32
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,583
What? For saving you?

33
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,833
[GIRL growls]

34
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,458
You!

35
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,250
Neeh!

36
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,375
[GIRL] Go back where
you came from!

37
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,833
Uh?

38
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,583
[GOHAN] Huh?

39
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,500
Oh, wow! Cool!

40
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,666
I don't remember
that being there!

41
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,916
[GOHAN] Oh, man! Shoot!

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,041
Don't tell me this
village is deserted too!

43
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,291
Gosh!

44
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,416
At this rate, I'll never
get Mom's shopping done!

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
This is the fourth
village I've been to!

46
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,166
Cell has really put
a scare into people.

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,291
I wonder where
they've all gone?

48
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,125
[GOHAN] Oh!

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,208
Great! Someone's still here.

50
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,666
Now what do you need
money for, you fool?!

51
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,291
The world's ending!

52
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,000
Perhaps. But no one
knows that for sure.

53
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,541
Especially not you.

54
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,750
Ahh! Shut your face, old man!
We're just gonna take it!

55
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,875
Look! We'll trade ya for it!

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,625
You can have free lodging
in the shelter with us!

57
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,708
You dig?

58
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,875
--That shelter is a bad idea!
--Huh?!

59
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,250
I've said that from the start!

60
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,708
--[GOHAN] Excuse me?
--Huh?

61
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,500
[MAN 2] What do you think
you're doing, small fry?!

62
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,166
Well, just picking a few
things up for my mom.

63
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,458
Hey, leave him be, Birdwell!
He's just a young punk!

64
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,250
Buzz off, kid!
We're sold out!

65
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,791
[GOHAN] Huh?!
But what's all this!

66
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,125
The Bourbon family
bought it! For the shelter!

67
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
Stop your nonsense! Now!

68
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,666
Hey, young man! Just tell me
what you need, okay?

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,125
Sure!

70
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
Let's see... One bag of--

71
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,625
Listen! What's your
problem, old man?!

72
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,666
Are you deaf?!
We need this! To survive!

73
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,291
Not just us! Everyone!

74
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,916
All of the villagers
are counting on you!

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,791
Give us the food!

76
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,291
Why should I?!

77
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,750
So the Bourbon family can
make the villagers work for it?!

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,666
Kasdan! Hey! I don't
think he's getting it!

79
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,833
I think he needs a
little persuasion!

80
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,958
--[GOHAN growls]
--Hey! Stop that!

81
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,833
What are you doing?!

82
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,916
[BIRDWELL chuckles]

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
[BIRDWELL]
This oughta do the trick!

84
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,500
[BIRDWELL chuckles

85
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,916
[GIRL screams]

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,208
--[GIRL] Cell! It's Cell!
--What?! He came back?!

87
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,125
--He's back!
--What?! Cell's been here?!

88
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,041
[KASDAN] Darn right!
I knew he'd come back!

89
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,708
Let's get to
the shelter, Birdwell!

90
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,500
See?! You should have taken us
up on our offer, you old coot!

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,250
[BIRDWELL screams]

92
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,875
[thinking] What the heck
is Cell doing out here?!

93
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:51,083
[GIRL] Oh, my gosh! Run!
Run! It's Cell! Cell's here!

94
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,875
--Heh?!
--Huh?

95
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,291
[GIRL] Run everybody! Run!

96
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,708
Hey! I know you!

97
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,125
[GIRL gasps]

98
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,458
Well, Miss Lime! Where's Cell?!

99
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,333
[LIME screams]

100
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,916
[LIME giggles]

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,250
Now, Lime! How many times have
I told you never to lie again?!

102
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,958
Huh?

103
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,791
Cell's not here?

104
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,666
[GOHAN] So that's the shelter
they were talking about!

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,000
[grunting]

106
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes. The villagers have
gone there for protection.

107
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,208
Just in case Cell comes back.

108
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,416
So... Cell was actually here
before in the village?

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,750
[grunting]

110
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,125
That's right.

111
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,500
There weren't a whole lot of
fireworks so to speak,

112
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,458
not in those days. He was still
stalking his victims for energy.

113
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,416
Oh... I see.

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,375
Oh yes. Mind you, he was
comparatively weak back then.

115
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,833
Still gathering lifeforce
to build up his strength.

116
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,291
[MAN screams]

117
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,666
[CELL] Hmmm...
What a waste of time.

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,166
Just a bunch of
weaklings! Pitiful!

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,083
[LIME sobs]

120
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,208

121
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,750
[GOHAN sighs]

122
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,541
Yes, Lime lost her
parents that day.

123
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,541
My gosh!

124
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,791
[LIME sniffles]

125
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,375
If you've seen... seen the
Cell then you know that

126
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,041
there is no use in running
away or building a shelter!

127
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,125
I'm not sure why they're
deluding themselves.

128
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,750
Believing in the shelter
brings them comfort, I guess.

129
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,250
They're a bunch of
fools! That's all!

130
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,041
Anyway, we still
have eight days to live.

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,583
That's not bad!

132
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
So here we are!

133
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,458
Trying to make the most out
of these last peaceful days.

135

It's your back again!

136
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,125
Why can't I do it?!
I'm big enough!

You're still a little
young, child! Thanks!

Hm?

142

Yes, I'd love your help!

forgetting something?

Even I know that you can't
chop wood without an axe!

Here!

H-Hey...

Is it possible we're
taking things too lightly?

that they have together.
