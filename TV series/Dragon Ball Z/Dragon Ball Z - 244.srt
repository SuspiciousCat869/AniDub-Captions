[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,208
Gohan summoned all
of his strength

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,083
to remove the legendary Z Sword

4
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,916
from its sacred resting place.

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,833
[GOHAN grunts]

6
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,208
[NARRATOR] If what Kibito and
the Supreme Kai say is true,

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,958
this mythical weapon
may give Gohan

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,041
the power he needs
to defeat Majin Buu.

9
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,333
Meanwhile, the
pudgy pink monster

10
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,208
prepared himself a feast
of unsuspecting victims.

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,333
[BUU]
Chocolate!

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,208
[NARRATOR] In an instant,
another city's population

13
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,041
was transformed into
thousands of tasty treats.

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,125
And this is still
only the beginning.

15
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,208
Buu will have
to devour far more

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,500
before his hunger for
destruction is satisfied.

17
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,125
The entire globe is in
danger of being gobbled up!

18
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,125
But all hope is not lost.

19
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,833
[GOKU] So the two of you should
start practicing fusion.

20
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,291
[NARRATOR] Goten and
Trunks are ready to

21
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,458
begin learning the
fusion technique,

22
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,500
and with Gohan in
training worlds away,

23
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,291
a hero may soon emerge
to defeat Majin Buu!

24
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,416
[GOKU] The fusion technique
is kind of like a dance.

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,208
You have to perform a
specific series of movements,

26
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,375
and your timing
has to be right on.

27
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,416
It's not that
difficult to learn, but...

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,041
It does take a lot of practice.

29
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,833
So, if you're ready,
we'll begin.

30
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,416
[GOKU]
C'mon, guys, what's wrong?

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,875
You know,

32
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,666
I don't think this fusion
stuff's as great as you say.

33
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,666
Why don't you just
give it a shot?

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,250
Okay, but it sounds kinda
stupid if you ask me.

35
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,541
I mean, it's not like
we're gonna beat Majin Buu

36
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,083
by dancing on him.

37
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,625
[GOKU]
That's enough, Trunks.

38
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,583
Now, both of you,
go Super Saiyan.

39
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,250
Fine. Whatever.

40
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,916
[GOKU] Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,958
Next step: raise your levels
as high as they can go.

42
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,291
Well, he asked for it, right?

43
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,541
Yeah. [chuckle]

44
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,791
[BOTH yell]

45
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,708
What is that?

46
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,166
[VIDEL]
What's going on, you guys?

47
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:46,166
Don't worry. That's just Goten
powering up. Trunks, too.

48
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,708
Not surprising. He does
take after his father.

49
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,166
[MR. POPO] Ahh. There's a
sound I recognize.

50
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,791
It's comforting in
a way, isn't it?

51
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,333
It makes me think those
boys can really do this.

52
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,791
Yes.

53
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,666
Amazing and at their age...

54
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,166
Good, now raise
it to your maximums.

55
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,000
[BOTH]
Huh...? We did.

56
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,833
[GOKU]
Oh. Well, in that case,

57
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,416
Trunks, your level's
a little too high.

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,875
Heh, heh.

59
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,375
If you want the fusion to work,

60
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,583
both of your power levels
must be exactly the same.

61
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,083
[GOKU] Trunks, take yours
down a bit to match Goten's.

62
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,125
[TRUNKS]
Right, take it down a bit.

63
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,750
So, something like this?

64
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,750
[GOKU] No. That's too low.
A little bit more...

65
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,666
More...

66
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,416
More!

67
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,125
There! That's perfect!
Remember how that feels.

68
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,500
That's exactly where
you guys want to be.

69
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,833
Great. Now back to normal.

70
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,166
Phew!

71
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,166
That's pretty tough, but why
do I have to do all the work?

72
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,000
Why can't Goten raise
his level to match mine?

73
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,958
I'm sorry, I couldn't.

74
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,250
It's okay, Son.
Trunks is older than you.

75
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,333
So it's only natural that he's
a little bit stronger, too.

76
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,916
[BULMA]
Excuse me, Goku.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,041
But I don't want you
doing anything in here

78
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,958
that's going to hurt my son!

could benefit
from a woman's touch.

again. How about you, Trunks?

I will save the

I'll save the mountains,
the women, and the children.

160
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,166
[IDASA'S MOM] Babidi? Babidi?
Can you hear me?

161
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,166
[BABIDI]
What's that?

162
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,458
I think you should
know that Trunks

163
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,125
lives at the Capsule
Corporation in West City.

164
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,208
Now you can go there
and give that little hoo-hah

165
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,250
what he has coming to him!

166
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,833
Who is this?

167
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,666
Why I'm the head of the
PTA at my son's school,

168
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,666
so it's my duty
to do what I can

169
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,458
to end this whole
silly situation.

170
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,083
Besides, that dirty little
Trunks cheated at the tournament

171
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,916
today and stole the
title from my son Idasa!

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,250
Of course, my boy was feeling
a little under the weather

173
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,666
or I'm sure he would have
pounded that stupid little boy

174
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,083
into mincemeat!

175
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,208
I've told him that's no excuse
I'm raising champions,

176
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,833
not losers, you know!

177
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,333
That's not
important, really.

178
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,166
What is important is that you
go and teach him a lesson!

179
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,208
And I tell you right no--

180
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,708
Shut up!

181
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,708
And thank you for sending me
this wonderful information.

182
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,000
But if I hear your annoying
screech of a voice again.

183
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,500
I will kill you!

184
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,000
[shrieks]

185
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,666
I try to do one nice thing
and this is how I'm treated?!

186
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,291
[growls]

187
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,958
This time, I want you to
power up as much as you can

188
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,583
without actually
going Super Saiyan.

189
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,208
It'll be easier to
concentrate on learning

190
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,125
if you're not under
so much physical strain.

191
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,125
[BABIDI using ESP] Attention,
Earthlings! Attention!

192
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,166
So sorry to bother
you once again,

193
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,625
but I've recently
acquired some information

194
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,916
I couldn't wait to pass along.

195
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,291
You know, Trunks,
I am very eager to meet you.

196
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,791
And if I can't
get you to come to me,

197
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,041
then I'll just have to
come to where you live.

198
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,166
[BABIDI using ESP] It's a place
called Capsule Corporation

199
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,875
and it's located in West City.

200
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,000
I hope that you're
there to see me when I arrive,

201
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,333
because if you're not,

202
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,125
then your friends
and your family

203
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,291
will have to pay the price.

204
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,333
[growls]

205
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:37,125
Darn! Somebody-Somebody
told that creep where I live!

206
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,583
I can't let him get there!

207
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,000
My grandma and grandpa
are still at home!

208
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,666
Are you going?

209
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,083
I just heard everything!

210
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,125
My mother and father
are going to be killed!

211
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,500
Don't worry about it.

212
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,416
We can just bring them
back with the dragon balls.

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,041
And everyone else in the city?
What about them?!

214
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:01,291
We can bring everyone else back
to normal with the second wish.

215
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,291
[PICCOLO]
That's impossible.

216
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,208
Don't forget, we've already
used our first wish

217
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,041
to bring back everyone
from the tournament,

218
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,791
which leaves us one wish

219
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,333
to repair the rest of
Majin Buu's ruin.

220
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,541
Oh, yeah,
I guess you're right there.

221
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,333
[laughs]

222
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,458
[growls]

223
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,083
[GOKU]
Hmmm...

224
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,791
I've got an idea.

225
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll bet you...
if we ask really nice

226
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,750
Shenron will let us wish
for two new wishes!

227
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,875
Would that work?

228
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,333
Sure, why not?

229
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,708
Well, I suppose it wouldn't
hurt anything to ask him.

230
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,166
Listen, if we let Majin Buu get
to the West City and destroy it

231
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,708
then he'll destroy
the Dragon Radar, Goku!

232
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,166
[gasps]

233
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,291
[GOKU] Yeah, that does
pose a problem.

234
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,000
Trunks, listen up.

235
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,375
I need you to go to Capsule Corp
and bring back the radar.

236
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,791
Huh?!

237
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,083
[GOKU] While you do that,
I'll get in front of

238
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,333
Babidi and Majin Buu
and try to slow them down.

239
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you sure about that? Those
guys are pretty tough, you know.

240
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,625
They're going to
wanna fight back.

241
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,375
Yeah, but you let
me worry about them.

242
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,625
I'll be okay. Now, hurry up
before they get ahead of you.

243
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:20,916
[BULMA]
Trunks?

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,083
You gotta promise.
Please come back here

245
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,291
if things get too
dangerous for you.

246
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,458
[TRUNKS]
I promise.

247
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,833
You fly fast and
get back here safe.

248
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,291
You got it!

249
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,166
[GOKU]
Good luck, Trunks!

250
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,375
[thinking]
I wonder if I should even leave?

251
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,958
Nah, they'll be fine.

252
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,166
Right, time to fly!

253
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,166
Don't worry, Bulma.

254
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,208
Trunks is a resourceful
little guy. He'll be all right.

255
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,750
I know.

256
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,833
No, I mean it!

257
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,166
Vegeta isn't the
only one of his parents

258
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,208
he takes after, you know.

259
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,666
Thank you.

260
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,416
[GOKU]
Goten? I want you to stay here

261
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,375
and hold down
the fort for me, okay?

Good.

You're a good boy.

265
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,500
That's it.

266
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,458
[BABIDI] No! Too fast!
I can't hold on! Slow down!

267
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,041
Help me! Please slow down!

268
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,916

[screams]

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,958
Would you quit playing
around like a child

272
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,708
and get me to West City?!

273
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,166
Okay!

What happened? Why did you stop?

00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,750
Hi.

00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,000
[BABIDI]
You're alive...

280
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,541
I was certain you'd been
disposed of by Vegeta,

281
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,958
but it seems you're
still breathing.

282
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,666
Well good, I was afraid
I wouldn't get a chance

283
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,125
to thank you for helping me
bring Majin Buu back to life.

284
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,041
[whistles]

285
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,375
Vegeta and I both
underestimated your monster.

286
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,875
We didn't want to believe
the stories were true.

287
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,500
We never would've
let you succeed

288
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,208
if we knew he'd
be this powerful.

289

[laughs]

290
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,708
So, why did you come?

291
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,833
Did you come to tell us
how powerful we are?

292
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,041
Or... did you come
to join our efforts?

293
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:10,666
Maybe, maybe you came to tell me
where the other two brats are!

294
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,333
[GOKU]
Not in a million years, Babidi!

295
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,291
For your information,
one of those brats is my son.

296
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,083
I'm here to give you a warning.

297
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:21,416
A warning? You came to
warn us? Oh, that's funny!

Now this is something I think
the entire planet should hear.

[giggles]

303
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,333
[GOKU] I want you to
listen very carefully.

304
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,958
The three people you're looking
for will appear soon enough.

305
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,541
That, I promise.

306
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,875
So if I were you,

307
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,375
I wouldn't touch another
thing until they get here.

308

[BABIDI]
Why should we stop?

309
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,708
Are they planning
something special for us?

310
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,125
[GOKU] Yes, and when they've
finished they're training,

311
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,583
they'll destroy you.

[BABIDI, BUU laugh]

315
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,458
They can train all day,

316
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,000
they'll never be stronger
than the two of us!

00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,083
[laughing continues]

318
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,208
Oh, you'll see.

319
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:16,416
[BABIDI, BUU laugh]

320
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,583
I don't think we'll
be waiting for that.

321
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,166
Tell them to show themselves

322
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,250
or we'll continue eliminating
all the people on this planet.

323
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,000
[giggles]

324
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,416
And tell them
that we'll start

325
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,166
with whoever we find at
this Capsule Corporation!

326
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
[giggles]

327
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh well, guess
it was worth a shot.

328
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,791
You know, before you
get to Capsule Corp

329
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,666
your going to have
to go through me!

330
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
[BABIDI laughs]

331
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,708
[BABIDI] That's a good one!
Buu, you heard what he said!

332
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,208
Go through him!

333
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,375
I suppose he wants to end up
just like his friend Vegeta.

334
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,541
[giggles]

335
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,000
What's wrong?

336
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,250
[BUU giggles]

337
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,208
Huh...?

338
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,750
[BUU giggles]

339
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,041
[burps]

340
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,000
[giggles]

341
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,125
You fool!

342
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,583
You're aiming that
stuff the wrong way!

343
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,541
Turn around and aim at him!

344
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,208
You! Show him what you're
made of! Hurry! Do it!

345
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay, I do it.

346
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,875
--[BUU giggles]
--[BABIDI sighs]

347
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,125
[GOKU]
I don't get it.

348
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,125
You're a thousand times
stronger than Babidi.

349
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Why do you let him boss
you around like this?

350
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,375
--[BUU] Huh...?
--[BABIDI gasps]

351
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,416
Don't listen! [growls]

352
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,041
And you'd better
keep your trap shut

353
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,416
if you know what's good for you!

354
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,791
[BABIDI growls]

355
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,166
[BABIDI] I resurrected Majin Buu
so he belongs to me!

356
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,041
Of course he's going
to do what I say!

357
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,291
[BUU growls]

358
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,541
Hey, do you want to
go back inside your ball

359
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,041
for another million years?!

360
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,708
Buu stuck back in ball,
you go bye-bye.

361
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,625
He gonna make you dead.

362
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,625
[thinking] That's the
problem with cronies.

363
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,041
No matter how dumb
they start off,

364
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,041
they all end up trying
to think for themselves.

365
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,166
No worry. Buu make you saved.

366
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,000
Me no like this
guy more than you.

367
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,458
Huh...? [sighs]

368
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,500
Well, so much for talk.

369
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,333
Buu have big fun now.

370
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,125
I'd like all the people of
the world to watch this.

371
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,125
A perfect example of
what will happen to anyone

372
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,333
who tries to stand in our way.

373
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,583
[giggles]

374
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,583
[GOKU growls]

375
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,833
Here we go!

376
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,166
[yells]

377
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,750
[gasps]

378
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,791
I can feel my dad's energy!

379
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,791
I know, your father
is an incredible man, Goten.

380
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,375
Whoa, unreal!

381
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,708
I can sense Goten's dad
from all the way over here!

382
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,958
He must be as strong
as... as my dad!

383
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,625
[laughs]

384
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,291
So, it's this trick again!

385
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,125
What a waste of energy!

386
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:10,083
Vegeta did the same thing and
look at what happened to him!

387
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,750
[BUU laughs

388
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,875
I'm guessing an
ascended Super Saiyan

389
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,666
isn't much of a
challenge for you.

390
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,708
So how about I take it
up to the next level?

391
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,458
The next level of a scented,

392
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:25,083
super something or, or
what? What's that?

393
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,000
Goku, what are you doing?

394
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,291
[NARRATOR]
Can Goku really push his powers

395
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,958
as far as he says he can?

396
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,208
And, if so, will he be able to
stall Majin Buu and Babidi

397
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,625
long enough for Trunks to
find the Dragon Radar?

398
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:45,208
Only one thing is certain,
if he can't, West City,

399
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,458
along with the rest of the
world will be doomed!

400
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,416
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next exciting episode

401
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,166
of Dragon Ball Z!
