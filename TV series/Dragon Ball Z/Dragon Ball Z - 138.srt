00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,625
Krillin was spared
a three-fisted face lift

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,250
when the trio
of evil androids

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,250
decided to go after
larger prey-- Goku!

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,125
And it looks like Vegeta's ego
will take a long time to heal.

6
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,833
[VEGETA] No one makes a fool
of me! They'll pay for this!

7
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,166
They should have finished
me off when they had the chance,

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,958
because I will show
them no mercy!

9
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,916
[NARRATOR] It seems Piccolo has
turned his back on his friends,

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,375
just when they need
his help the most.

11
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,625
[PICCOLO] I'm leaving,

12
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,083
and anyone who tries to
follow me will be sorry!

13
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,083
Don't worry, guys.

14
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,583
Piccolo just has
a lot on his mind...

15
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,375
He's still one
of the good guys!

16
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
Piccolo has gone
to Kami's place

17
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,375
to join with him again!

18
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,666
Together, they'll
be an unstoppable force...

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,875
...a Super Namek!

20
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,916
[NARRATOR] The androids must be
stopped before it's too late.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,666
But can Piccolo convince Kami
to make the ultimate sacrifice?

22
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,666
FInd out today!

23
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,375
[PICCOLO thinking] I know Kami
senses something is wrong...

24
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,333
Why doesn't he say something?

25
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,708
[KAMI thinking] Things must be
more serious than I thought.

26
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,375
Uh? Kami...?

27
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:13,291
This isn't a social call it's
business! I think you know that.

28
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,750
Yes, I know...

29
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,208
Of course, I do.

30
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,208
The bond we share is of the mind
as well as the body, remember?

31
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,708
I know exactly what's
on your mind, Piccolo.

32
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,041
Hmph! Good! That
saves me some time.

33
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,666
What an unexpected
honor this is.

34
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,750
I never thought that you and
I would ever be united again.

35
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
Stop smiling!

36
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,291
I'm not doing this
because I want too.

37
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,583
It's because I need our
combined powers. That's all.

38
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,833
To be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure how

39
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,208
I'm going to tolerate
being so close to you.

40
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,041
Your mere presence sickens me!

41
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,666
Oh... Kami!

42
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,458
[PICCOLO] Trust me,
I'd have preferred it

43
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
if I never had to
look at you again!

44
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,416
[KAMI growls]

45
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
[KAMI thinking] Piccolo's
attitude angers me,

46
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,541
but I can't blame him...

47
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,291
He is a part of me.

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,666
I have watched him fight

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,833
one formidable enemy
after another...

50
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,291
And he has beaten
the odds every time.

51
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,833
[PICCOLO yells]

52
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,833
No! You can't!

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,041

Yes... unite
with me, Piccolo...

00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,916
[PICCOLO grunts]

61
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,041
[KAMI] My power is nothing
compared to Piccolo's...

62
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
He has developed
strength and abilities

63
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,083
far greater than I
could have ever imagined.

64
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,875
[KAMI] Perhaps my time

65
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,666
as guardian of Earth
has come to an end.

66
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,875
No, Kami! You are
still needed...

67
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,541
The people of Earth still
need you to watch over them.

68
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,291
[KAMI] You are too kind,
Mr. Popo...

69
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,791
but I must act for
the good of the Earth.

70
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,708
This is about
the continuing struggle

71
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,958
for power between the
forces of good and evil.

72
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,958
And the danger that
looms over us now

73
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
poses a greater threat

74
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,333
than anything we
have faced in the past.

75
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
Even Vegeta
with all of his strength,

76
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,583
was no match for these androids.

77
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,666
[KAMI]
Super Saiyan or not,

78
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,875
he was tossed
aside like a rag doll!

79
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,750
These androids will
be difficult to beat.

80
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,000
Even if Goku recovers
from his illness,

81
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,583
he will provide
little resistance

82
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,375
against these
powerful new foes.

83
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,541
In our combined form,
Piccolo may be the only one

84
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,000
strong enough to win this fight!

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,791
We agree.

86
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,250
The force that threatens Earth
is bigger than both of us.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,708
But at least when
our powers are united

88
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,708
we still stand a chance.

89
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,041
And no matter how slim that
chance is, we must take it!

90
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
[KAMI] Hold on...

91
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,666
I haven't agreed
to anything yet!

92
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,458
Time may still
be on our side.

93
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
Listen, I would
like to let things

94
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,541
play out further
before I make my decision.

95
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,083
You want to see
how things play out?!

96
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,916
Have you lost your mind?!

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,583
[KAMI] Silence! Sometimes
things are not always

98
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,750
what they appear
to be, Piccolo.

99
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,833
[PICCOLO growls]

100
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,666
[KAMI] And I am
not entirely convinced

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,208
that the aim of these androids
is to destroy the Earth.

102
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,625
Is this a joke?!

103
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,041
You've sat
here and watched

104
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,958
everything that's
gone on below

105
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,250
and you're still going
to let it continue?!

106
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,083
Don't you remember
what Trunks said?!

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,458
The future will be
destroyed by these androids!

108
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,708
Yes, but Trunks
made a mistake.

109
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,125
He told you that the androids
you encountered today

110
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,375
are not the same ones
that he fought in the future.

111
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,958
[PICCOLO chuckles]

112
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,916
Yeah, right. And these androids
are a real great bunch of guys

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
once you get to know them.

114
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm serious.

115
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,666
I know you may
not agree with me,

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,958
all I'm saying is I still need
more time to make up my mind.

117
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,916
[PICCOLO]
Have it your way!

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,458
You're scared! I know...

119
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:30,916
[PICCOLO] If you
need time then take it.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I'll be waiting right here.

121

Hmph.

long as you want.

clock is ticking.

[KRILLIN] Yeah?

126

I think I'm going to
go pick up Chiaotzu

127

so we can get back to training.

Sure! Sounds good!

As soon as things
get dicey again,

how much good we'll do.

Okay, go get Chiaotzu
and meet up with us later.

We're going to move Goku
over to Master Roshi's house.

That should buy us all
a little bit more time.

a good idea, but...

before, Krillin.

Alright! I'm glad you
made it here safe!

So if you guys are here,

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,416
you must have defeated
the androids, right?

I can't explain now...

296
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,666
But we have to
evacuate this place

297
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,541
and transport Goku to
Master Roshi's right away!

00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,791
Huh?

299
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,291
[KRILLIN] We're dealing
with a group of androids

300
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,041
that are a thousand times
more powerful than any of us!

00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,291
[CHICHI] Be careful with him!

304
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,750
[YAMCHA] Boy, I think Goku
has packed on a few pounds.

305
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,333
Give him a break.
He hasn't been himself lately.

306
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,666
[KRILLIN] Hey, Yamcha,
where's Gohan?

307
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,125
[YAMCHA] He should be
getting home any time now.

308
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,250
Look! Gohan's back!

309
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,166
Here he comes!

310
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,416
[GOHAN] Hey, what's going on?

311
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,958
[CHICHI] You've come
home! Oh, my baby!

I'm so happy to see you!

Uh? Hey what are
you guys doing?

314
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,875
No time to talk.
On the plane, Gohan!

315
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,416
[thinking] Something's wrong...
Something I've missed...

316
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,166
[NARRATOR] Goku is on his way
to a safer hiding place

317
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,125
but his trail is warm and the
androids are in hot pursuit.

318
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,708
Krillin and the others can
only hide him for so long

319
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,833
before they are discovered!
