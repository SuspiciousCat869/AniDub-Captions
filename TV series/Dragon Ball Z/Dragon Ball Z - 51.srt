1
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,916
Now what do I do?

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,916
Goku!

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,250
Get outta there!

4
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

5
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,208
Goku took a very wrong turn on
his journey to Planet Namek!

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,875
But as he plummeted into the
fiery heart of a giant star,

7
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,208
it was our hero who
turned up the heat!

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,541
Kaa... Mee...
Haa... Mee... Haaa!

9
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,750
[NARRATOR] With the help of
a powerful Kamehameha Wave,

10
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,166
the ship blasted free
of the star's gravity

11
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
and resumed its
course to Namek!

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,333
It would seem
Goku's intense training

13
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,625
has begun
to pay off...

14
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,666
And he'll need every
ounce of strength

15
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,875
he can get if he
hopes to face Vegeta!

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,375
The evil Saiyan has
become even more powerful

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,541
since their
last meeting...

18
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,083
And he's only too
happy to show it!

19
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,541
Bang.

20
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Can nothing
stand in Vegeta's way?

21

Oh, I see.
Sounds like you guys

32
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,625
had a rough
time out there.

33
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,875
Yeah, I'd say we're
lucky to be alive!

[sighs sadly]

I know it's
not very good,

37
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,500
but you should probably
try to eat something

38
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,166
to get your
strength back.

39
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,375
[BULMA]
Not very good?!

40

[BULMA growls]

41
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,875
Well, that sure
hasn't stopped you

42
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,375
from stuffing
your fat face.

43
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,458
Would it kill
you to show me

44
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,875
a little appreciation
for once?! Huh?!

45
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,125
I... I wasn't
talking about the food!

46
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,291
I swear! It's the
best I ever had!

47
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,208

[laughing continues]

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,875
I'm sure he's just
too upset to eat.

51
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,125
I mean, after
everything that's happened.

52
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:24,208
Please try. It might
make you feel better.

53
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,791
I'm sorry,
but we don't eat.

54
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
We Nameks only
drink water.

55
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,416
Uhh... Really?
But wait a second.

56
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,166
You guys had fields full of
vegetables out by your village.

57
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,500
I saw 'em myself.

58
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,291
The fields you saw
were Ajissa plants.

59
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,666
W-W-Whoa... 
Ajima wha--?

60
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,083
Well, the elders say
that the Planet Namek

61
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,500
used to be a very different
place than it is today.

62
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,166
They say our world was
once lush and beautiful,

63
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
alive with
forests of Ajissa.

64
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,625
But one day, a massive
storm darkened our skies.

65
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,125
Violent winds tore
across the planet,

66
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,166
stripping the Ajissa plants
of their delicate leaves.

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,416
The forests
were destroyed.

68
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,291
In fact,
all life on our planet

69
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,125
was brought to the
brink of extinction.

70
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,125
The Eldest Namek remembers
how the Ajissa plants

71
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,833
brought beauty to our planet,
and helped make the soil rich.

72
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,083
That's why we're trying
to grow more of them.

73
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,416
We hope this will bring our
world back to life.

you haven't told

Did they find us?
Is someone coming?

It's... it's Vegeta! He's
attacking one of the villages!

That bastard! Those Nameks
never even had a chance!

Why, he's just an
animal, isn't he!

110
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,333
Yeah, and from
the looks of it,

111
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,166
now he knows how to sense
power levels without a scouter.

112
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,166
So we're stuck. 'Cause if
we try to fly anywhere

he'll find us!

I don't know if he's
working with Frieza or not.

We may not be able to
fight them directly,

120

but if we can manage to find
just one of the Dragon Balls

121
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,250
and hide it, we can stop
them from making a wish.

[GOHAN] No.
That's not enough.

It won't stop them
from looking for it.

00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,458
But he'll never suspect
it's hidden so close to home.

163
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,750
[VEGETA] So... six of the Dragon
Balls are now accounted for.

164
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,500
Only one
left to find.

165
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,250
It's been
too long.

166
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,083
Dodoria should have
been back by now.

167
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,125
Something must
have happened.

168
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe I'd better
go look for him.

169
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,000
[FRIEZA] Forget him.

170
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,916
If he isn't
capable of dealing

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,875
with two puny pests
and a baby Namek,

172
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,666
then I don't
want him back.

173
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,916
Continue your search for
the last two Dragon Balls.

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,208
[HENCHMAN] But, how will we find

175
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,000
the Namek villages
without our scouters?

176
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,791
We'll have to search
this entire planet!

177
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,458
And that's exactly
what we'll do.

178
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,166
Don't worry, Lord Frieza.
We'll find them.

179
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,625
[FRIEZA] I expect nothing
less from you Zarbon.

180
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,625
Now, leave all the
Dragon Balls with me.

181
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,625
I'll wait for you
back at the ship.

182
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,375
Come to me when you
have the final two.

183
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,625
And do hurry...

184
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,541
I'd like to make my wish
before I die of old age.

185
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,000
[BOTH] Lord.

186
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,333
[ZARBON] I want you to
search in that direction.

187
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,875
If you find
any villages,

188
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,250
note the position and
come get me at once.

189
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,291
Don't try and take on
the Nameks by yourself.

190
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,541
They're way too
strong. Understand?

191
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,041
Sir.

192
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,250
Otherwise, meet me back at
the spaceship in three hours.

193
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,708
Now, head out!

194
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,208
If Vegeta tries to
interfere with my plans

195
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,750
for getting all
the Dragon Balls,

196
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,583
he will soon
regret it.

197
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,958
I refuse to stop until I've
collected all seven of them.

198
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,333
But I imagine he'll be
on his way sometime soon

199
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,833
to try to steal
these five.

200
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,708
Well, that's fine with me.
I hope he does try it.

201
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,833
He'll just save me the trouble
of having to hunt him down.

202
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

203
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,416
Poor Vegeta has no idea
what he's getting into.

204
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,666
So, I can just
relax at the ship.

205
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,750
Ha!

206
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,375
[KRILLIN] So you see,
we thought if we came

207
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,791
to Kami's
home planet,

208
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
there might be another
set of Dragon Balls here.

209
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,083
We hoped we'd be able
to wish all our friends

210
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,125
that Vegeta and his
partner killed back to life.

211
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,166
That's all we're
trying to do.

212
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,750
Not only that, if
our wish is granted,

213
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,583
it means the Earth's Dragon
Balls will come back, too.

214
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,875
Oh. Thank you for
telling me your story.

215
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,708
So your world has been
terrorized by these men, too.

216
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,166
[DENDE growls]

217
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,416
Then we must fight
them! Together!

218
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,125
And I know
someone who can help.

219
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,791
I must take you to
see the Eldest Namek!

220
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,500
Huh?

221
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,291
And, who's that?

222
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,000
But how can
he help us?

223
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,291
Oh, he is
very wise.

224
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,625
He is the father
of all Nameks!

225
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,375
He alone survived
the terrible storm

226
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
that nearly
destroyed our world.

227
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,125
And he is the one
who is responsible

228
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,208
for repopulating
it so far!

229
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,500
We are all
his children.

230
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,125
I myself am
his 108th child.

231
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
But, um, well...

232
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,791
How exactly did your father
have a child all by himself?

233
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
What do you
mean "how"?

234
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,875
He spit the eggs out
of his mouth, of course.

235
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
Oh, right.
H-How silly of me...

236
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,500
Wait, so what
you're saying is

237
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,916
he is actually a she,
right? A female!

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Female?
What's a female?

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,583
[BULMA] Well, there's
two types of people, right?

240
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,958
Males and females. And
they're... they're different.

241
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,208
So, like for
instance, say...

242
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,833
You have brothers,
and you have sisters!

243
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,541
What?
Different types?

244
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,416
Uh... No...

245
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,916
[BULMA gasps]

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,833
Can you believe this? There's
no different genders here!

247
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,500
They're all one type!
I'm sure glad I'm not a Namek.

248
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,166
Talk about boring!

249
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
'Kay. Anyway...
So you really think

250
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,291
going to see this Eldest
guy'll do us some good?

251
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,458
Yes... But, it's
important that we go quickly.

252
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,125
The ones who
attacked my village

253
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,666
already have five
of the Dragon Balls.

254
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,083
And, if another
village is being attacked

255
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,500
right now,
like you say,

256
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,833
unless the Nameks
can hold them off,

257
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,208
they'll be looking for
the Eldest Namek soon.

258
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:07,166
Sorry, kid.
I think it's all over.

259
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,333
[GOHAN] I'm not sensing
any more power levels.

260
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,875
It doesn't feel like
Vegeta left any survivors.

261
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Oh, no...
If that's true,

262
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,250
then there are only a
few of us left alive now...

263
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,083
Wait a sec... So, if Vegeta
got the sixth Dragon Ball

264
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,458
in that village, and if
there aren't many Nameks

265
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,041
left out there...

266
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,708
Then, does that mean the Eldest
Namek has the last Dragon Ball?

267
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right.

268
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,208
This is bad!

269
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,458
[ALL gasp]

270
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,833
[KRILLIN] It might take
Frieza's goons a while

271
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,041
to find him without
their scouters,

272
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,333
but that won't
stop Vegeta!

273
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,375
If he has any
kind of power,

274
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,625
Vegeta will sense
him from miles away!

275
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,666
For all we know, he could be
on his way there already!

276
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,625
Exactly! And we must warn the
Eldest Namek that he's coming!

277
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,625
Please! Please, you have to
help me! Come with me, please!

278
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,333
It's risky, but I'd say
we'll be in even more danger

279
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,166
if we let Frieza or Vegeta
get that Dragon Ball.

280
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,708
'Kay, let's go. You lead
the way. I'll follow.

281
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,166
Right.

282
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,833
With any luck, this
won't take too long.

283
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,833
But I want you to
wait here with Bulma

284
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,958
until we get
back, okay?

285
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,958
We can't let
Vegeta sense us both!

286
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,708
You're right. It'll be
better if we split up.

287
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,291
See ya! You guys
be extra careful.

288
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,666
You, too! Bye!

289
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,291
[thinking] Vegeta seems
stronger than he's ever been.

290
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,125
And the power I
sensed from Frieza

291
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,916
was even higher than his!

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,666
I don't know what kind of
training Goku's doing, but...

293
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,166
But whether he's strong
enough to beat them or not,

294
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,541
the only thing we can do now
is get the last Dragon Ball

295
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,708
from this Eldest Namek and
hide out for a few days

296
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,000
until he gets here.

297
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,625
Then I guess we just
cross our fingers

298
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,583
and hope we don't
all get creamed.

299
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,625
[KRILLIN thinking]
Ahh, who am I kidding?

300
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,125
I doubt any of us're gonna
make it off this planet!

301
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,708
I'm gonna die here...

302
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,208
And I've never even
had a girlfriend!

306

[GOKU] Well, I guess that does
it for twenty-times gravity.

307
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,750
Good, then it's time to
start working on thirty.

[KING KAI]
Goku, can you hear me?

309
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,666
Helloooo...
Come in, Goku...

310
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,208
Hey, I sure hope
that's you, King Kai.

311
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,125
[KING KAI] No, it's the
chair talking to you.

312
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,625
Of course it's me!

313
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,666
How are you, Goku? I had some
trouble tracking you down.

314
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,416
You're moving at a
pretty good clip there

315
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,166
in that spaceship of yours.

316
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
But I guess it means
you're off to Planet Namek

317
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,416
for a little Dragon Ball
hunting, huh? Sounds exciting.

318
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,416
Wait a second...

319
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,041
You mean you
don't know anything

320
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,458
about what's
been going on?

321
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,500
It's a long story, but
there's a whole lot of trouble

322
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,250
waiting for
me on Namek.

323
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,625
You can fill me
in in a minute...

324
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,541
First, I have something
important to tell you.

325
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,333
You see, I've received
some unexpected guests.

326
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,833
[GOKU] Guests? What's the big
deal about having some guests?

327
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,666
[KING KAI] Well for starters,
they got down Snake Way

328
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,541
even faster
than you did!

329
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,583
Let's just say, they're
some pretty strong guys.

330
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:58,333
Stumped? Okay, I'll give you
a hint. There's four of them!

331
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,916
Huh? Four?

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,916
[KING KAI] Yup. Let's also say
you know these guys pretty well.

333
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,958
[GOKU] No way!
You don't mean...

334
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,833
[KING KAI chuckles]

335
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,083
You guessed it!

336
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,375
They're here, and they
want me to train them

337
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,666
harder than
I trained you!

338
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,125
You gotta be kidding me!
Everyone made it?

339
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,541
They all reached you
together? That's great news!

340
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,416
Hey, can I say
hello to him?

341
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,791
[KING KAI] Of course.
Just rest your hand

342
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,125
on my shoulder and speak.
He'll hear you.

343
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,208
[YAMCHA] What's up, Goku?

344
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,708
[GOKU] Yamcha!

345
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,500
Guess we just missed each
other at the check-in station.

346
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,791
But we saw Kami, and he
told us about this place.

347
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,375
Uh-huh.

348
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,875
[YAMCHA] Anyway, King Kai told
us you guys might try to find

349
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,416
the Dragon Balls
on Planet Namek

350
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,750
so you could
wish us all back.

351
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,625
That's really great, Goku.
You're a good friend.

352
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,750
Thanks, Yamcha.
So, who all's there with you?

353
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,750
What about Piccolo?
Did he make it?

354
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,875
[YAMCHA] Yeah,
he's here alright.

355
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,833
Heh. Like I'd let those
clowns train without me.

356
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:06,916
I don't want them
to start thinking

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,416
they can show me
up or anything.

358
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,666
[GOKU] And you said you ran
into Kami. Is he there, too?

359
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,875
No, not Kami.

360
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,458
He stayed back at the
Check-In Station.

361
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,166
It's Tien
and Chiaotzu!

362
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,708
[GOKU] Chiaotzu? That's
fantastic! How is he?

363
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,541
Is he doing okay?

364
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,166
[YAMCHA] He's doing
just fine, Goku.

365
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
In fact, I almost had
trouble keeping up with him

366
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,000
coming down Snake Way! Heh, heh!

367
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,500
[GOKU] Ha, ha, ha!
All right! Way to go, Chiaotzu!

368
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,458
[CHIAOTZU chuckles]

369
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,166
[GOKU] Wow, you guys.
This is great!

370
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,750
You don't know how glad
I am to hear from you!

371
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,583
[NARRATOR] Goku is
certainly relieved to learn

372
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,250
of his friends' safe
arrival on King Kai's planet.

373
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,750
However, still more of
his friends are in danger

374
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,208
on Planet Namek!

375
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,041
Can they escape the watchful
eyes of Vegeta and Frieza?

376
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,416
Don't miss the
next Dragon Ball Z!
