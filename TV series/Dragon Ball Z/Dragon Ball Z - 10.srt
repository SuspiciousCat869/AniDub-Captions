00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,750
Gohan's trials
continued,

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,333
as the creatures
of the wilderness

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,750
fought to capture him
for a tasty snack.

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
And it was all
Gohan could do

6
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,541
to keep himself
out of their claws!

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,250
Gohan's adventures dropped
him into the dark center

8
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,750
of an ancient ruin,
where fortunately for him,

9
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,416
he discovered he
had some company...

10
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,958
[ROBOT] Who are you?!

11
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,208
[NARRATOR] But when the ruins
suddenly began to collapse,

12
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,250
Gohan's robot friend threw
himself into harm's way,

13
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,708
and held back the falling
rock just long enough

14
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,375
for the young
boy to escape.

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,000
[GOHAN sobs]

16
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,916
[GOHAN]
Please!

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,416
[ROBOT]
Time to shut down...

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,083
It's my fault...

19
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,125
[NARRATOR]
Now, alone once again,

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,083
Gohan journeys into the unknown
with a new determination

21
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,458
to make himself stronger,

22
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,166
so that the next time
trouble rears its head,

23
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
he'll be able to
help his friends...

24
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,541
Good luck, Gohan! The
Saiyans arrive in one year!

25
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,291
[GOHAN] It's harder bringing you
back than it was catching you!

26
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,208
[GOHAN grunts]

27
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,875
[breathes heavily]

28
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,166
Ah, berries...

29
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,000
Hm?

30
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,750
Now, just a little
bit farther...

31
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,291
Ahh, yum!

32
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,666
Uh oh, I better
get back.

33
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,166
Aahh!

34
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,125
[groans]

35
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,583
Ow...

36
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
[lightning strikes]

37
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,208
[GOHAN whimpers]

38
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,333
[animal growls]

39
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,541
[GOHAN yells and whimpers]

40
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,333
[lightning strikes]

41
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,291
[GOHAN]
I can't believe this.

42
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,416
I never thought I'd have
to do this myself...

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,416
I hope I'm
doing it right...

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,666
Uh...

45
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:23,916
[GOHAN bawls]

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
[GOKU]
There we go!

47
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,000
[bawling]

48
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,708
No, daddy!
It hurts!

49
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,666
I know it stings a
little bit, Gohan...

50
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,000
But I promise
it'll help!

51
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,250
No, I don't want
any of that stuff!

52
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,416
I want Mom to do it!

53
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,416
[sobs]

54
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,333
Come on...

55
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,916
[winces]

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,041
That's it! You did it!

57
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,625
Now it'll be better in no time.

58
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,750
[GOHAN] All right.
Here it goes...

59
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,166
[winces]

60
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
[CROWD cheers]

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
[helicopter whirs]

62
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,916
[ANNOUNCER #1] It's the
bottom of the ninth,

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
the defending
champions are leading

64
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,458
the Taitans
six to three...

65
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
And it's the pitch!

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,500
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

67
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
[CROWD cheers]

68
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,833
[ANNOUNCER 1] Murdock caught
swinging on the change up!

69
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,375
Oh-ho boy! You know he's gotta
be hating himself for that one!

70
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,041
[ANNOUNCER #2] You've got
that right, Martin...

71
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,125
And you can bet the
intimidation factor

72
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
from this man here had
a little something to do

73
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,375
with that little lapse
in concentration!

74
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,541
[ANNOUNCER 1] Absolutely! Rocky
Rivers has hit more batters,

75
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,208
and he's pitched
fewer innings

76
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
than any other pitcher
in the league!

77
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,625
[ANNOUNCER 2]
Now those are stats

78
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,791
you don't want to
write home about.

79
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,708
[ANNOUNCER 1] And the
pressure has got to be

80
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,291
mounting for that man.

81
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,041
[ANNOUNCER 2] Right! Yamcha's
already hit three solo homers,

82
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,583
but how long can he
keep up the streak?

83
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,833
What's up, Puar?

84
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,500
Gee, I thought you
were snoozing!

85
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
Aren't you nervous
about winning the game?

86
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,625
[YAMCHA sighs]

87
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,041
[YAMCHA] What's there to be
nervous about? This is too easy.

88
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,208
It seems like every time
I step up to the plate

89
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,166
I hit a home run.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, but that's a
good thing, isn't it?

91
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,291
I'm a fighter, Puar!
I'm not a ball player!

92
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,541
Don't talk
like that!

93
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,458
Fighting doesn't pay
the rent, Yamcha.

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,791
You have to make
money somehow!

95
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,916
[ANNOUNCER #1] Rocky Rivers
with the windup... The pitch!

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,083
[MURDOCK groans]

97
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,166
[ANNOUNCER 1] Oh!
And Murdock's been hit!

98
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,666
Atta' boy, Murdock!
Alright!

99
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,666
Hey, Yamcha!

100
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,208
Huh?

101
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,875
We got two men on
for you hot-shot!

102
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,041
You can bring 'em in,
can't you?

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:48,291
Hey, it's worth a bonus.
Well, what d'ya think, huh?

104
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,625
It's a pretty
big game.

105
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,583
The Pennant...
Twenty thousand zeni...

106
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,083
How's that for
a nice bonus?

107
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,833
It's hard to believe
the entire season's

108
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,541
resting on my shoulders.

109
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,708
That's an awful
lot of pressure...

110
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,291
Twenty-thousand
it is.

111
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,541
[HEAD COACH and YAMCHA laugh]

112
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,916
Wow. That'll pay the rent.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
[ANNOUNCER #1] And there's
the Taitan's slugger, Yamcha,

114
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,125
in the warm up box...

115
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,166
Tying run at
the plate...

116
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,083
[UMPIRE] Play ball!

117
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,541
[ANNOUNCER 1]
Two men on...

118
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,166
Bottom of the ninth... Two outs.

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
[ANNOUNCER #2]
And look at Freddie Hines

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,333
signaling in to
Pepper Johnson

121
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,500
Bottom of the ninth...
The Pennant at stake...

122
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,250
You have to wonder
with all the pressure

123
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,625
if he even knows
what he's doing.

124
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,000
[ANNOUNCER 1] Looks like he's
had too much coffee to me!

125
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,500
Heh, ha!

126
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,375
And here's the pitch!

127
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
[UMPIRE]
Striiiiiike one!

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
[ANNOUNCER 1] Johnson caught
looking, or rather, not looking.

129
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,208
And you have to wonder
just what signal

130
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,208
the Taitan manager
sent in earlier.

131
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,208
Here it comes, ladies.

132
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,250
[ANNOUNCER 1]
And here's the pitch!

133
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,166
Breaking ball...

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,333
Ha, ha!

135
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
[ANNOUNCER 1] Oh!
Now Johnson's been hit!

136
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
[commotion]

137
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,000
[ANNOUNCER 1]
That's two in one inning!

138
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,291
[ANNOUNCER 2] Boy, that's
not going to go over well.

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,666
Pepper Johnson is
obviously shaken-up.

140
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,875
I wouldn't be surprised if
a fight broke out here.

141
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,333
Hey! You jerk!
You did that on purpose!

142
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,416
So what! What do you think
you're gonna do about it?

143
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,875
That's it,
meat-head!

144
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,916
Come on!

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
[ANNOUNCER #1]
There goes Johnson!

146
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,041
And now both benches
are clearing! What a game!

147
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,250
[ANNOUNCER 2] I've never seen
anything like this, Martin!

148
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,833
Not in a
Pennant race!

149
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,875
[ANNOUNCER 1] And there's
the Taitan slugger, Yamcha!

150
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
So far he's one of
the few players

151
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,791
that's chosen not
get involved....

152
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,041
[ANNOUNCER 2] He probably
doesn't want to get hurt.

153
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:43,083
[YAMCHA laughs forcefully]

154
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,916
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,458
Yamcha, stay
out of it!

156
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,583
You don't want to hurt
anybody, now do you?

157
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,125
Oh, Puar, it's just a little
rumble! I'll try to be careful!

158
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,625
Okay, have fun!

159
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
Oh, my...

Hello!

Huh?

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,333
Krillin!
What are you doing here?

166
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,791
Y'know,
just hangin'!

167
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,708
I do have something I need
to tell you though, Yamcha.

00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,458
Why don't we
go over here?

Are you serious?

[PUAR]
But, Goku can't be... dead.

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,666
Yeah... he
sacrificed himself.

we can wish him back!

[KRILLIN] Huh?
Hey... Guys?

183
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,916
Bulma's still mad about
the time you stood her up!

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,916
You should explain that you
were just out of money.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,208
Huh! Yamcha was broke
ninety-nine percent

186
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,583
of the time anyway!

187

Man! Being a jerk just
comes so natural to you!

193
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Yeah? Well, I'd say
I owe all my training

194
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,083
in that department
to you, Bulma.

195
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,333
Krillin, if you need some
help against those Saiyans,

196
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,791
let me know.

197

Wait a second! That's what
I came to talk to you about!

I do need you!

199
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,083
Korin wants us all to report
to him for special training!

200

For real, Krillin?

We don't want to be late!

I've been running...

make us stronger, too!

Maybe after the big

I can keep him as a pet!
That'd be so much fun.

322
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,500
Gotta...
keep... going.

323
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,500
[birds chirp]

324
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,916
[GOHAN]
What happened?

325
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,958
[GOHAN thinking]
Oh no, my friend...

326
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,500
[NARRATOR] The course of nature
isn't always easy to accept.

327
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,083
But as Gohan is learning,
in the remote wilderness,

328
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,000
survival of the fittest is
the only law of the land.

329
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,541
And difficult
though it may be,

330
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,125
sometimes there
is little choice

331
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,333
but to put the past
behind and forge ahead!

332
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:53,916

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
