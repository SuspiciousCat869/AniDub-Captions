[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,041
Gohan stumbled upon
the discarded shell

3
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,708
of a mysterious creature,

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,000
the likes of which
he had never seen before!

5
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,083
But where in the world
did it come from?

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,291
...what hatched out of the shell

7
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,916
we found in the time capsule.

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Right. It grew up and
then molted out of its skin...

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,458
you think?

10
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
It's still wet...

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,250
This thing must be
somewhere close.

12
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,666
[NARRATOR] This vile
monstrosity is on the loose,

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,541
lurking about the countryside.

14
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,958
But did it really
come from the future?

15
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,291
And for what sinister purpose?

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,250
While Trunks and the others
contemplate the answers

17
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,750
to these questions,
elsewhere, trouble is afoot!

18
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,250
[NARRATOR] It's the Androids!

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
And their quest to find
Goku is almost complete.

20
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,541
Meanwhile,
Kami looked on in horror

21
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,125
as the tensions built
on the earth below.

22
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,000
A terrible new evil
is about to be unleashed!

23
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,041
It there anyone
who can stop it?

[GOHAN] Hey, Trunks...

[GOHAN] Earth to Trunks!

27
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,458
Huh? Yeah?!

28
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,625
[GOHAN] Do you have any idea
what kind of a creature

29
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,083
that might have been back there?

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,125
Nope. Afraid not.
But whatever it was,

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,041
it was just about
the ugliest thing

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,875
that I've ever seen!

33

[GOHAN]
Man, you're not kidding!

34
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,875
That thing almost
made me sick to my stomach!

--[GOHAN] Yuck!

[GOHAN] Hey, you said that
it probably got here

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,708
four years ago, right?

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,791
[TRUNKS] Yeah. At least
that's what the indicator

00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,666
in the time capsule read before
the batteries went dead. Why?

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,333
[GOHAN] I just find it
hard to believe that

41
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,500
a creature like that could
be here for four whole years

42
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,375
without anyone noticing it!

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,750
I mean, doesn't that seem
a little bit weird to you?

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,416
Yeah.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
But what I want to know is...

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,250

and for what reason?

a new dress, anyway?

How do you think I like it?

to find much better
in a hick town like this.

of the disaster in Gingertown...

all activities in the
West City suburb of Gingertown

halt this morning

mysteriously vanished
