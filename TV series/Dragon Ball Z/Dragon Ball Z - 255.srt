00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,291
a new friend was helping Majin
Buu discover happiness on Earth!

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,291
But tragedy struck
when a deranged gunman

4
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,333
shot the innocent puppy!

5
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,791
[NARRATOR]
His next target was Mr. Satan,

6
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,750
Buu's only other
friend in the world!

7
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,416
[NARRATOR]
Devastated by the loss,

8
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,375
the child-like Majin Buu
made a desperate attempt

9
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,333
to restore Mr. Satan to health.

10
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,291
[NARRATOR]
Miraculously, Buu succeeded,

11
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,083
but a horrible conflict
started raging within him!

12
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,166
GO NOW!!!!

13
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,750
[NARRATOR]
The good had taken root

14
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,958
and the evil had to be expelled!

15
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,833
And in a giant puff of steam,

16
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,375
Majin Buu rid himself
of the wicked tendencies

17
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,375
that had once plagued him!

18
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,416
[NARRATOR] It seemed as
if Buu had won the war,

19
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,083
but when his nefarious vapors
started assuming physical form,

20
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,000
it became clear that the
true battle with his dark side

21
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,333
had only just begun!

22
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,166
[NARRATOR] In a blazing flash,
the evil Majin Buu was born!

23
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,708
[NARRATOR]
His first business of the day

24
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,208
was to pay tribute
to the murderous gunman

25
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,333
by giving him a taste
of his own medicine!

26
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,625
Aaaaugh!

27
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,916
[NARRATOR] Then, it was time
to face his goodly counterpart!

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,916
There can be only one!

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,375
Which of them will survive
the Battle of the Buu's?

30
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,166
[BUU growls]

31
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,250
Stop it! Who are you?

32
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
Tell me who you are first!

33
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,250
Me Buu! Majin Buu!

34
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,500
You fool! I'm Majin Buu!

35
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,500
Whoa! Did you hear that?
We were right!

36
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,083
They're both Majin Buu!

37
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,958
Come on, Majin Buu!
Let him have it!

38
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,625
Give it to him real good!

39
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,458
That's it! Nail him, Buu!
All right! Yeah! Go, Buu!

40
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,958
Oh, yeah! They're both Buu!

41
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,750
Uh, that makes it
hard to root for him!

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,208
[DENDE] They both seem to be
Majin Buu! Is that possible?

43
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,583
It is. Don't forget, Kami and
I were separate, but also one.

44
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,083
I just know that the struggle
was already taking place!

45
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,458
Only now it's on the outside!

46
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,500
[BUU] Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Hoooo, hoo!

47
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,625
Way to get him
pinned, Majin Buu!

48
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,791
You're the one, big guy!

49
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,791
Huh?

50
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,166
[PICCOLO]
I don't know!

51
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,875
I don't like this, Dende!

52
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,375
He's even stronger than
the original Majin Buu!

53
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,166
This is not good!

54
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,583
[BULMA]
Trunks, you're all sweaty!

55
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,166
[CHICHI] Goten, you're
burning up! Here! Have a drink!

56
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,375
[PICCOLO] Trunks! Goten!
Playtime is over!

57
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,750
It's time to get back to work!

58
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,500
--Hmm? Huh?
--Huh?

59
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,833
Uh! Excuse me!
But we just got back!

60
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,875
Can we please take
a rest now, Piccolo?

61
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,291
You're too uptight!
Just leave it to us!

62
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,375
We're strong enough
to beat that guy already!

63
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
Why you little--

64
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,250
I've fought with both
of your fathers in combat!

65
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,250
Since before you were born!

66
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,916
You two don't have a clue!

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,333
Even the smallest bit of power
could mean the difference

68
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,750
between winning and losing!

69
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,125
--[CHICHI clears throat]
--Huh?

70
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,750
How dare you! I think
you're forgetting something!

71
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,250
Goten and Trunks are
boys not men. Understand?

72
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
But they need to train

73
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,375
No! They need to rest!

74
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,208
That's right!
Goku let Gohan take naps!

75
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,375
It's only proper!
They're children!

76
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,333
Yeah! What good is
all the training gonna do

77
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,791
if they're worn out
when the fight comes?

78
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,708
They're both totally exhausted!

79
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:37,458
All right! Fine!
Perhaps it would benefit!

80
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,000
Trunks, Goten! We'll resume our
training after you take a nap!

81
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:41,875
Right!

82
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,666
I get the big fluffy pillow!

83
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,625
[GOTEN]
Nuh-uh!

84
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,791
Hey! Not so fast, Goten!

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,666
You need to take a bath first.

86
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,583
You're all sweaty from the last
fight you were in, aren't you?!

87
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,875
[GOTEN]
Okay, Mom!

88
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,583
Hey! You too, Trunks!
Get yourself clean!

89
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,791
[BULMA]
I will, Mom!

90
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,708
Most unusual!

91
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,708
Never train children when
their mothers are around!

92
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,875
It's always trouble!

93
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,750
Buu make you chocolate!

94
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,333
[PICCOLO]
He hit him with his own attack!

95
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,791
[PICCOLO thinking]
You've got to be kidding me!

96
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,791
[DENDE thinking]
He's chocolate!

97
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,291
[laughs]

98
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,541
I don't believe it!
Look at him!

99
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,791
He's even meaner
looking than the last one!

100
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,250
[yawns]

101
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,958
Yaaaaaaaaah!

102
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,041
[PICCOLO]
Brace yourself!

103
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,583
[CHICHI] Oh, my goodness!
It must-must be an Earthquake!

104
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,500
No! We're up in the sky!

105
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,125
In school we always took
cover under our desks, right?!

106
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,875
Good idea!

107
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,583
[GOTEN] Hey, our moms
are under the table.

108
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,875
[TRUNKS]
Hmm? Really?

109
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,791
[GOTEN] Mhmm. They must
want our bubblegum.

110
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
[CHICHI, BULMA]
Huh?

111
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,250
Hm? Oh, no!

112
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,291
It's coming from Earth!

113
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,250
Man! That's incredible!

114
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,875
[GOHAN thinking]
What an awful power!

115
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,666
[OLD KAI giggles]

116
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:47,458
[laughs]

117
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,333
[GOHAN thinking] I've never
felt anything like this!

118
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,750
What's going on down there?

119
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,208
[laughs]

120
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,541
[MR. SATAN groans]

121
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,791
[MR. SATAN] He looks so evil.

122
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,875
[laughs]

123
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,958
Whoa! Astounding! His new power!

124
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,666
[KRILLIN] Hey, did you
feel that, you guys?

125
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,875
What just happened?

126
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,375
Majin Buu transformed!

127
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,541
Yes, and it's brought his power
to a level I can't even measure.

128
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,666
Not only that, but the
dark side won the battle!

129
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,333
He's become almost pure evil.

130
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,708
Hey! It couldn't be that bad!

131
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,833
We can still beat him, can't we?

132
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:20,083
Come on! Of course we can!
Goku said it himself! Remember?

133
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,291
Buu doesn't have a chance!
Not against the fusion!

134
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,708
Spectacular power! But I've
never felt anything this evil!

135
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,958
Yes! Indeed!

136
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,666
[laughs]

137
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,666
Please! Kai, sir!

138
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,916
There must be a way

139
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,625
that we can finish this
routine a little sooner.

140
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,666
At this rate, the planet
that I'm supposed to save

141
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,666
is going to be history!

142
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,333
Just do it to the maximum!
It'll all work out!

143
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,250
Sir! Please! Just hurry!

00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,708
[sighs]

147

[MR. SATAN groans]

148
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,583
Hyaaaah!

149
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,333
Huh?

150
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,708
Oh, yeah! He's gone!

151
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,250
All right! I should've known!

152
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,083
Nobody wants to mess
with the mighty Mr. Satan!

153

No, sir-ee! I am the king!
Hahaha!

154

I don't blame him!

155
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,166
I'm twice the size
of that pink sissy!

156
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,708
And he didn't want
any of this anyway!

157
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:29,208
No way! Baby!
Hahahaha!

158
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,250
Gee! Hi, Buu! Nice day!

Hey, Bee did you see that?
Buu remembered us, boy!

161
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,000
He's still in there somewhere!

162
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,458
Piccolo, please!
Tell me the truth!

163
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,125
Do we even have a chance?

164
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,000
Well, it's hard to say!

165
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,333
I really don't know yet!

166
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:57,083
The fused Trunks and Goten
should put up a good fight!

167
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,416
If they can fit it into
their schedule that is!

168
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,291
Boy! I'm stuffed!

169
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,083
[yawns]

170
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,375
I need to take a nap
before I fall asleep!

171
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,958
Hey, Goten!
I'll race you to the bed!

172
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,375
Okay!

173
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,708
Wait, Trunks!

174
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,250
I want you to go hop in
the bath first! Remember?

175
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,166
Yes! You too, son!

176
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,250
'Kay! We will!

177
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,625
Hey! Let's take a bath together!

178
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,291
[TRUNKS]
No way! Forget it!

179
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,041
What?

180
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:07,958
[gasps]

181
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,375
[KRILLIN]
What is it, guys?

182
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,083
He's coming!
Majin Buu! He's here!

183
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,083
He's here!

184
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,708
Look! Don't attack unless he
attacks one of us first! Got it?

185
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,166
[NARRATOR] The ability
to sense energy levels

186
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,125
has led the new Majin Buu
straight to the nerve center

187
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,458
of the Earth's defenses!

188
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,666
[NARRATOR]
Aware of his friends' plight,

189
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,791
Gohan struggles
to remain patient,

190
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,416
while Goku looks on helplessly
at the bleak predicament

191
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,041
facing his family and friends!

192
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,208
[NARRATOR] What demented
plans does the new Majin Buu

193
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,416
have for the Earth's
special forces?

194
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,000
And, if given the
opportunity to fuse,

195
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,791
would Trunks and
Goten have a chance

196
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,666
against this new
incarnation of wickedness?

197
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,791
Stay tuned for more of the
phenomenon, on Dragon Ball Z!
