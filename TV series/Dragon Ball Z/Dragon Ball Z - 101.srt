[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,875
a wish to the
Eternal Dragon of Earth,

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,458
was used to revive all
of Frieza's victims

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,083
on the planet Namek.

5
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,708
[NARRATOR] Even Guru
was brought back to life

6
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,833
which meant that Porunga,
the Eternal Dragon of Namek,

7
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,833
would also rise again,
since it was interrupted

8
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,208
before it was able to
grant a third and final wish.

00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,958
[PORUNGA roars]

10
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,250
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Goku and
Frieza were going head-to-head

11
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,208
in a vicious clash of energies!

12
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,166
It seemed that the
winner of this battle

13
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,125
was going to win the whole war.

14
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,625
Goku was holding his own when
Frieza launched a sneak attack

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,041
that buried the Super Saiyan in
the rocks and molten lava below.

16
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,583
Has Frieza managed
to defeat our hero?

17
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,583
Find out today!

18
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,958
Why am I not surprised?

19
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,541
You Saiyans are
like a stubborn virus.

20
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,958
And now the virus has
mutated to preserve itself!

21
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,416
But I know how to treat it!

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,541
I know how to blot
it out for good!

23
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,958
You should have never
come back here, you know.

24
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,916
I really thought you were dead.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You could have left
this place and escaped.

26
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,916
I would have never known it!

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,791
No way! Why run from somebody
that you're not scared of?

28
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,916
Huh! Just for that one...

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,875
I'm going to blow you to pieces!

30
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,750
Just like that little bald guy!

31
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,750
[FRIEZA giggles]

32
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,916
That little bald guy
was my best friend!

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,916
His name was Krillin!

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah, how could I forget that?

[GOKU growls]

36
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,375
Now, die!

37
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,458
Fool! I'm not the one
who's going to die here!

38
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,000
Catch my drift?

[GOKU] haah!

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,875
[KING KAI] Guru! I know
we don't have much time,

50
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,333
so let me get
straight to the point!

51
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,375
Am I correct in seeing
that the Dragon of Namek

52
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:47,416
has been revived, and is
waiting to grant a third wish?

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,208
[GURU] Yes, King Kai...
It is just as you say.

54
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,833
[KING KAI] Guru, please have
someone ask the Dragon

55
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,458
to transport everyone on
Namek to the planet Earth

56
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,333
except for Frieza!

57
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,083
[GURU] Hmm! It will be done.

58
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,791
Thank you for your
thoughtfulness!

59
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,041
It is clear you have the
well-being of my people in mind.

60
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
We are indebted to you.

61
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,208
I will have someone make the
wish as you have directed.

62
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:16,041
But there is no time
to lose! We must hurry!

63
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,458
[GOKU] No! Don't do it!

64
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,750
[KING KAI] Huh?!

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,750
[GURU] Huh?

66
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,125
[KING KAI] Goku, is that you?

67
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,750
[GOKU] King Kai, please make
a change in your wish!

68
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,375
[KING KAI] Goku, how can
you be listening to us

69
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,583
and fighting at the same time?

70
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,291
Huh?!

71
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,875
[GOKU] King Kai, don't have the
Dragon send me back to Earth!

72
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,416
[GOKU] Ask the Dragon
to send everyone to Earth

except for Frieza and me!

[KING KAI] Goku!
You can't shoulder

75
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,875
the whole load by yourself!

76
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,791
Get out of there for now!
We'll make a plan!

[GOKU &amp; FRIEZA grunting]

78
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,416
[GOKU] I can promise you
that any plan we made

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,916
would boil down to
this in the end anyway!

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,125
Let me face him now! It's
already happening, why stop it?

81
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,416
[KING KAI] Goku, I just don't
want to see you get hurt!

82
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,000
[GOKU] King Kai, let
go of what you want!

than that! Please!

King Kai, what's wrong?
Is something up with Goku?

87
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,500
Is Goku in some kind of
trouble? You can tell us!

in a trance...?

[TIEN] Hey, King Kai?
Can you hear me?

Will you please stop
that, you silly fools?!

95

[KING KAI] Goku, I can't do it!

death warrant!

cloud your judgement!

Search your feelings! You know
what's right deep down inside!

Feel it out and do it!

[KING KAI] Guru! I want
to change my wish!

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,166
Please have someone
ask the Dragon

102
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,583
to transport everyone
on Namek except Frieza

103
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,708
and Goku to the planet Earth!

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,583
Wow! The Dragon is back, too!

105
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,875
Then, I guess that
means I really am alive!

106
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,916
[GURU] Heh, heh, heh, heh!
What a smart boy! And so brave!

Dende! How are you, my son?

[DENDE] Guru, is that you?!

109

[GURU] Yes, Dende. It is I!

110

[DENDE] But how? I thought you
were... I thought we were...

felt more alive, my son!

But we have work to do!

Do you see the Dragon
before you, my son?

It's right in front of me!

carefully, Dende.

like you to make.

be moved to the planet Earth

Now you're gung-ho

What's the deal?
Is your phone call over?

Good thing they reached you

[BULMA] Why am I doing this?

131

I must be losing my mind!

00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,958
Gosh, Gohan! Why'd you have
to leave? How long can I wait?

133
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,416
I hate being unselfish!
It's always such a drag!

Oh, kid, I would do anything
for you, you know that!

135

But it doesn't make sense
for us to sit here and die!

136

I can't take it anymore!
I've got to get out of here!

That wasn't too hard!
Here we go!

See ya later, kid.
Good luck...

live with myself, would I?

to say about all this?

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,083
[thinking] We still
have a chance!

160
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,000
[KING KAI] Goku! How
many Super Saiyans

161
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,750
does it take to screw
in a lightbulb?

162
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,666
[GOKU] How many?

163
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,791
[KING KAI] There's no telling,

164
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
but it only takes
one to beat Frieza!

165
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,833
[KING KAI laughs]

166
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,750
[thinking] What's
he smiling about?

167
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,791
[KING KAI] Come
home alive, Goku!

168
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,750
[GOKU] Don't worry! I intend to!

169
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,375
Thank you, King Kai...

170
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,458
[thinking] The Dragon of Namek!

171
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,875
Excellent!

172
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,833
It looks as though everything's
going according to plan!

173
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,125
What?!

174
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,958
There is no plan!

175
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,833
[FRIEZA gasps]

176
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,750
[FRIEZA] Isn't that the Dragon?!

177
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,458
Yes!

178
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,333
[thinking] But how...?!

179
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,916
Those rotten schemers lied to
me! They tricked me somehow!

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,416
Wait a second! Maybe
it's not too late! Yes!

181
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,208
It's wish time!

182
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,166
Hm? Uh-oh!

183
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,333
[FRIEZA growls]

184
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,416
[GOKU yells]

185
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,916
[blows landing,
shouting]

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,541
You dirty dog!

187
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,291
Takes one to know one!

188
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,250
[blows landing,
shouting]

189
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,708
[VEGETA gasps]

190
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,208
[VEGETA gasps]

191
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Is that the dragon?!

192
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,333
[GURU] Hurry, my son!

193
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,083
[KING KAI] Yes! Yes!
He's almost there!

194
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,583
Dragon!

195
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,416
[PORUNGA] Yes, boy, speak!

196
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,875
[DENDE] I want to
make a wish now!

197
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,333
I can do that,
can't I?

198
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,958
Yes, you can!
One wish still remains!

199
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,125
Right! Thank you, sir!

200
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,958
Just make the wish, young one!

201
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,666
Yes, okay! I can do this!

202
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:57,458
[blows landing,
grunting]

203
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:02,541
Eternal Dragon, I'm ready
to make my wish now!

204
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,583
[FRIEZA yells]

205
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
[FRIEZA growls]

206
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
Oh, no! Frieza!

207
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,333
No, no!

208
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:15,791
Dragon, I wish for eternal
life! Grant me immortality!

209
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:26,125
[DENDE speaking in Namek]

210
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,583
Huh?!

211
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,458
Yes, very well,
I will grant it!

212
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:40,916
I will move everyone on Namek to
Earth Planet except these two!

213
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,375
[GOKU chuckles]

214
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
[FRIEZA gasps]

215
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,958
Why, you little runt!

216
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,708
[FRIEZA yells]

217
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,625
[FRIEZA growls]

218
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,791
[VEGETA] Frieza!

219
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,041
Huh?!

220
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,500
Wha...?

221
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,541
Hey! Yeah!

222
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,500
Welcome back, Vegeta!

223
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
I guess it's a good thing

224
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,708
I didn't bury you
that deep after all!

225
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,500
[VEGETA laughs]

226
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,083
[VEGETA] Well, well, well!

227
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,875
Kakarot, you dog!

228
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,083
You did it, you actually did it!

229
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,750
You're a Super Saiyan,
I can see it!

230
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,958
Now what? I-I killed you!
You must be a ghost!

231
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,000
[VEGETA] Can a ghost
do this? Huh, Frieza?!

232
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,458
[VEGETA yells]

233
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,791
My work is done.

234
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,250
[PORUNGA roars]

235
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,541
[FRIEZA] The Dragon Balls...

236
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,583
What? No! Come back!

237
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,458
[FRIEZA whimpers]

238
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,000
[FRIEZA] I waited so long...

239
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,791
[GOKU] You actually beat that
little guy to the punch!

240
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,833
But it looks like you
have to say the wish

241
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,958
in their native tongue!

242
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,416
But that was great!
You almost had it!

243
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,125
[FRIEZA growls]

244
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,500
You were so close,
I could feel it!

245
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,958
That green kid, I could've
sworn that I killed him!

246
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,583
[GOKU] Yeah, I almost forgot!

247
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,375
We used the Earth's Dragon Balls

248
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,708
to wish back everyone
that you killed!

249
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,208
What?!

250
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,916
Wait 'til I tell you the
wish we just made here!

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,375
You mean you orchestrated this
whole thing telepathically?!

252
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,666
I had help!

253
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,416
We wished that everyone
on this planet

254
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,708
would be moved to the planet
Earth except for the two of us!

255
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,583
[FRIEZA growls]

256
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,333
[FRIEZA screams]

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,333
[YAMCHA] King Kai!

258
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,916
Did it work?
Did they make the wish?

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,416
[KING KAI] Yes, everyone is
on Earth, safe and sound!

260
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,083
Yeah!

261
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,916
Right on! We did it!

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,916
[KING KAI] But Goku elected to
remain on Namek with Frieza!

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,250
Wait, what?

264
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,500
He insisted on
finishing his fight

265
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,958
with Frieza, so I
changed the wish!

266
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,708
What? That's crazy!

267
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,500
Uhh...

268
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,333
[GOHAN] Bulma!

269
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,333
Huh?!

270
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,291
[BULMA] Hey! Wow! Alright!

271
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,625
[GOHAN grunts]

272
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,500
[BULMA] Gohan! Why, you
little runt! You left me!

273
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,083
I waited, and
waited, and waited!

274
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,458
I'm sorry, Bulma!

275
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,083
Hey, no biggy,
kid! Forget it.

276
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,750
Where are we? This isn't Namek.

277
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah, that's for sure!
Maybe we're dead?

278
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,875
Maybe! But I don't
think so though...

279
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,208
[NAMEKS murmuring]

280
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,125
Hmmm...?

281
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,291
You're... Dende?

282
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,916
Yes!

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Where...

284
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,500
Um, you're on Earth, sir!

285
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,875
On Earth? Where's Goku?!

286
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,041
[PICCOLO] Oh, no!

287
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,375
Hey! Goku?!

288
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, wow! Piccolo! It's me!

289
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,125
Gohan!

290
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,750
Wow! It's really you! And Dende!

291
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,166
That means that...
Ow! Nope, I'm alive!

292
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,458
Me too! I think that
someone wished us back!

293
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,375
[GOHAN] Wow! What about
Krillin?! Is he back too?

294
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,125
I'm not sure...

295
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,708
Yeah, right...

296
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,375
I guess he can't be wished back
by the Dragon more than once...

297
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,625
[NAMEKIANS] Guru!

298
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,750
--Wow! Guru's here too?!
--Oh, neato! It's Guru!

299
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,333
[DENDE] C'mon! Let's go!

300
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,916
[GOHAN] Bulma, Piccolo, come on!

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,208
[NAMEK 1] Where are we, Guru?

302
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,916
Yes, that's a good question.

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,791
We are on a planet
called Earth, my son.

304
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,125
Huh?!

305
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,416
What in the world? How
did we get back to Earth?!

306
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,916
Did Goku win, or
did Frieza beat him?!

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,250
[GURU] The two of them
are fighting as we speak,

308
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,541
writing the final
chapter to a story,

309
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,916
that neither you nor your
children will soon forget.

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,083
The Super Saiyan could
have come with us

311
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,333
but decided to
remain on Namek.

312
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,291
You see it's like this...

313
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,958
I can't believe this!
I was so close to Frieza

314
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
I could have
spit on him!

315
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,541
That Dragon was there, too!

316
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,166
Somebody must have wished
for this to happen!

317
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,041
[KING KAI] There's hardly
any time left!

318
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,750
Stubborn, thick-headed--!

319
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,583
Why are you doing
this to me, Goku?

320
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,791
I'm too old for
this sort of thing!

321
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,916
Most planets would
have blown by now!

322
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,375
But this is a tough, old bird,
I'll give her two more minutes!

323
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,708
[thinking] That's not much time!

324
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,958
You sealed your fate
with that stupid wish!

325
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,125
There's no way out for you now!

326
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,541
Either you perish in battle
at the hands of yours truly,

327
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,666
or you win, and then: Kaboom!

328
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,916
You die anyway because there's
no more air to breathe in space!

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,333
Sounds bad!

330
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,916
But I've actually been looking
forward to this moment!

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,041
Now I can fight you
without worrying

332
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,666
about the safety of the others!

333
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,583
Fool! Why worry
about such trifles?

334
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,541
Those peons can't even fathom
what's been taking place here!

335
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,125
[GOKU] I know I'm strong,

336
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,625
but that doesn't make
my life more important

337
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,083
than anyone else's!

338
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,291
A rare fighter indeed!
What a treat!

339
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,500
I'd forgotten how
exhilarating it can be!

340
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,583
[NARRATOR] With the Planet Namek

341
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,000
teetering on the
edge of destruction,

342
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:44,458
Goku and Frieza are poised
to begin the final round.

343
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,041
[NARRATOR] But will Goku
be able to take down Frieza

344
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,500
in time to make it
off the planet?

345
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:54,750
On the next
Dragon Ball Z!
