00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,875
Vegeta made an explosive return
to the Tournament Arena...

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,083
The hatred in his
heart reawakened

4
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,291
by Babidi's magic,
the Saiyan prince

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,375
had become a servant
to the forces of evil.

6
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:31,791
[GOKU] Babidi! Transport us to
a place away from these people!

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,000
If you give me that,
then I will fight Vegeta!

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,375
[NARRATOR] Babidi willingly
granted Goku's request,

9
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,416
and zapped the Z Fighters
from the stadium floor.

10
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,750
Now, miles from civilization,

11
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,958
the two Super Saiyans are free
to fight without restraint,

12
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,875
which is just what the wizard
wants, for every blow

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,541
they land is a boost
for Majin Buu!

14
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,000
Unless Gohan and the
Supreme Kai act quickly,

15
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,666
Buu will soon have the
energy he needs to emerge

16
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,125
from his cocoon!

17
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,000
[GOHAN thinking] I've never
sensed anything like this.

18
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,875
So cold, and empty.

19
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,583
[BABIDI]
Welcome, friends!

20
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,125
I'm glad you could join us!

21
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,666
[GOHAN breathes heavily]

22
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,041

24
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,750
[SUPREME KAI]
Listen.

25
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,916
There is still time before Majin
Buu reaches his full power.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,875
We have to strike.
Together, on my mark.

27
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,708
Hold nothing back, Gohan.

28
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,041
This creature must never
see the light of day.

29
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,875
The fate of your
world depends on it.

30
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,000
[GOHAN]
I know.

31
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,916
[GOHAN, SUPREME KAI grunt]

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,416
Wait, Kai.

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
[gasps]

34
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Let's take this outside.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,583
It seems a bit cramped
in here, doesn't it?

36
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,166
Yes, and when Buu wakes up,
I have a feeling he'll agree.

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,583
He's sure to be restless.

38
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,458
I hate to think what would
happen if we were trapped

39
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,500
with him in this
cozy little place.

40
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,875
Wizard...

41
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,291
You need not worry what
your monster will do to you.

42
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,041
Not when you still have
me to contend with.

43
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:29,958
[cackles] Squeak. Squeak. He's a
noisy little rat, isn't he?

44
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,083
Rraaah-mm... Papparapa!

45
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,166
[GOHAN]
Huh?

46
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,791
[gasps]

47
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Now, Dabura...

48
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,583
You are feeling up to this?

49
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,416
I'd hate for you to wear
yourself out and quit

50
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,291
in the middle of the fight...

51
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,541
Rest assured.

52
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,666
These two will be easily
removed from your sight.

53
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,333
They're rubbish!
I'll clean them up easily.

54
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,500
[cackles]

55
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,958
[cackles] Good, you can dispose
of them any way you like.

56
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,000
Maybe you could even
turn them into stone!

57
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,875
Two more statues to
add to our collection.

58
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,208
No.

59
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:24,750
I have something far
more painful in mind.

60
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,416
[GOKU yells, groans]

61

[VEGETA, GOKU grunting]

62
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,833
So, you've still got
plenty of fight left.

63
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,291
Yeah.

64
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,333
Heh. Impressive. I didn't
think you'd last this long.

65
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,541
Really? I could say the
same about you, Vegeta.

66
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,000
You've learned a few new
tricks while I've been away.

67
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,083

00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,083
[BABIDI] Did I mention how
glad I am to see you, Kai?

72
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,208
Now I can finally avenge
my father... can't I?

73
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,083
You remember, don't you?
The way you murdered my father?

74
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,041
I suppose he let his guard down.

75
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,000
I won't make that mistake.

76
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,500
I won't be done in
like my father was,

77
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,750
especially not by you. I learned
from his shortcomings.

78
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,958
I've made his
weaknesses my strengths!

79
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,083
For example, I've learned
to keep better company.

80
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,500
Father never did have a
knack for spotting talent.

[SUPREME KAI grunts]

82
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,541
[SUPREME KAI thinking] He's
right. He's completely on guard.

83
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,458
A direct attack would play
right into his hands.

84
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,083
There must be a way!

85
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,541
I have to get to Majin Buu!
We're running out of time!

Come on, Gohan! Snap out of it!

00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,458
You shouldn't be
afraid of these guys!

00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,916

Let go, son! Let go...

[GOHAN thinking]
Uh, Dad?

91
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,000
You've got all the power
you need to beat these guys,

92
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,625
if you can just
remember how to fight

93
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,125
with your feelings,
like you did against Cell.

94
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,666
Just remember all the
people you're fighting for

95
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
and how much you
care about them.

96
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,500
And then let that
be your weapon.

[GOHAN thinking] I'm trying,
Dad. I'm trying to remember!

fight with Cell...

Would you believe,
I almost started to think

319
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,208
the Earth was a
nice place to live.

320
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,583
Do you understand now, Kakarot?

321
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,416
That's why I needed Babidi!

322
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,416
To set me free! By releasing
the evil in my heart...

323
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,750
...he has freed my of
these petty attachments.

324
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,833
And I'd have to say
it feels pretty good.

325
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you really believe
what you're saying?

328
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,791
[DABURA] At last,
success Master Babidi.

329
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:55,458
[BABIDI] Oh yes!
Sweet, beautiful, success!

330
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:59,541
He's gonna come out!
Majin Buu's coming out!

[NARRATOR]
After centuries of plotting,

336
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,916
Babidi's plans are finally
coming to fruition!

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,791
Majin Buu is going
to be set free!

338
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,375
And the Earth's best hope
for stopping the monster

339
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,708
has his hands full elsewhere.

340
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,208
Hurry, Goku!
Time is running out!

341
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,500
Human kind's darkest
hour is at hand!

342
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,500
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned
for scenes from the next

343
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,125
exciting episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
