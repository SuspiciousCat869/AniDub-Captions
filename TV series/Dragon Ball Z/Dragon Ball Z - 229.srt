00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,583
Vegeta was attacked from within
by Babidi's dark magic,

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,125
and by the hatred from his past.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,166
[SUPREME KAI] Fight it,
Vegeta! You must resist!

5
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,250
[NARRATOR] Discovering the
evil thoughts still buried

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,250
deep in Vegeta's heart,
Babidi quickly manipulated them

7
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,333
to his own advantage.

8
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,833
All the bitterness,
hurt, and anger

9
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,541
that had ruled Vegeta long ago
were brought to the surface.

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,541
It consumed him.

11
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,125
And put him under
Babidi's control.

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,000
Once finished,
the wizard took no time

13
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,041
in putting his new
slave to the test.

14
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,000
Cruelly transporting
the Z Fighters back

15
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,250
to the World Tournament Arena,
where Vegeta could

16
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,166
attack his friends
while endangering

17
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,875
thousands of innocent lives.

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,291
And at the same
time, gather energy

19
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,083
for Majin Buu's revival.

[GOKU gasps]

21
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,083
[NARRATOR] Vegeta fired
a powerful energy blast

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,291
that not even
Goku could deflect.

23
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,958
And as the Saiyan hero
was thrown to the side,

24
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,958
Vegeta's attack made a direct
hit on the audience nearby.

25
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,083
The Z Fighters could
only watch in horror,

26
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,250
as nothing but cinders remained.

27
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,291
[NARRATOR] It was difficult
to believe that this gruesome

28
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,333
human catastrophe had been
caused by one of their own.

29

[GOKU]
Shame on you.

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,833
[NARRATOR] But despite
Babidi's commands to destroy

31
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,541
all the Z Fighters,
Vegeta wants only one thing.

32
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,416
It has plagued his
mind ever since

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
the days of Frieza,
but will his deepest desire

34
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,375
at last be realized?

35
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,791

I was just saying
it was a possibility.

But Gohan and my
dad are real strong.

Oh, and they say
your dad's okay, too.

162
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:23,208
[cackles] Now they'll
crumble from the inside!

163
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,708
So be it!

164
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,166
[grunts]

165
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,208
If you truly believe this
is the right decision...

166
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,166
...then you will have to
get around me to do it!

167
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,375
[GOKU]
Don't do this, Supreme Kai.

168
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,750
[SUPREME KAI] Goku...
I'm afraid I have no choice.

169
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,125
[GOKU]
Then neither do I.

170
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,833
[GOHAN gasps]

171
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,625
[gasps]

172
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,000
[gasps]

173
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,458
Dad, you can't!

174
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,041
[SUPREME KAI]
Fine. Do what you will.

175
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,875
[SUPREME KAI]
I can't stop you.

176
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,000
[GOKU]
I'm sorry, Supreme Kai.

177
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,958
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes... So am I.

178
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,833
[cackling]

179
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,541
[BABIDI] Oh! See them go
at each other's throats!

180
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,916
Serves you right, Kai!

181
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,291
Now it is a simple
game of waiting...

182
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,833
And Majin Buu will return.

183
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:30,041
[BABIDI cackling] I'll move
them. It's a small price to pay!

184
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,500
Papparapa!

185
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,708
[ANNOUNCER]
Huh? That's weird.

186
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,083
They're gone again!

187
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,458
Just flat disappeared!
How do they keep doing that?

188
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,291
[laughs] That's a pity!

189
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,208
And here I was just
about to go over

190
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,750
and take them all on
at the same time! Darn!

191
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:05,333
I trust you'll have
no more excuses.

192
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,958
None.

193
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,000
Dad, don't do this!

194
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,000
[SUPREME KAI]
It's all right.

195
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,708
There's no point resisting
what cannot be helped...

196
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,166
We will just have to
continue our efforts

197
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,208
with a new strategy.

198
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,208
While you two fight up here,
Gohan and I will break open

199
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,125
the ship's entrance and
continue our assault

200
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,250
against Babidi and Dabura.

201
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,750
I believe we still
have a chance

202
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,541
at stopping them
before Buu's revival.

203
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,791
If tampering with the ship's

204
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,541
entrance ruptures Buu's shell,
it will still be better

205
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,041
than allowing him
to reach full power

206
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,250
from the energy lost by Goku.

207
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,958
After all the time I've
spent tracking Majin Buu,

208
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,208
I will avert him
with my own hands.

209
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,541
Oh, no you don't!

210
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,583
You're forgetting what I can do!

211
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,208
Vegeta! Destroy this nuisance!
Kill the Supreme Kai!

212
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,458
Kill him!

213
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,375
[VEGETA grunting]

214
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,666
[BABIDI] The only way is
to kill the Supreme Kai!

215
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,500
Yes! Kill him, Vegeta!

216
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:17,375
[VEGETA grunting, yelling]

217
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,375
[gasps]

218
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:23,666
[VEGETA grunting, groaning]

219
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,916
Babidi's entered his mind!

220
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,166
[VEGETA grunting, groaning]

221
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,666
[BABIDI] You can't afford
to let him live, Vegeta!

222
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,125
[VEGETA screams]

223
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,416
[VEGETA groaning]

224
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,333
[BABIDI]
Kill him, Vegeta! Kill him!

225
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,083
I refuse.

226
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:51,791
What?!

227
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,125
Huh?

228
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,708
Your business with the Kai.

229
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,833
It means nothing to me!

230
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,541
Kakarot is my only objective.

231
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,000
That's amusing, Vegeta
but I'm serious.

232
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,875
By every fiber in your body,
I command you to destroy!

233
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:10,250
[VEGETA grunting]

234
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,291
Kill... Kill the Kai!

235
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,625
[VEGETA]
N-No. Get out of my head!

236
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
I already told you!

237
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,583
I... will not...

238
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:27,208
...be distracted from
this anymore! I won't!

239
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,958
It will take more than
head games to stop me.

240
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,041
You may have invaded
my mind and my body,

241
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,791
but there's one thing
a Saiyan always keeps!

242
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,750
His pride!

243
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:46,250
[VEGETA yells]

244
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,625
[BABIDI grunts, yells]

245
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:03,958
[VEGETA panting]

246
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,875
But-But this has never
happened to me before!

247
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,291
Since when can the possessed
say no to the possessor?!

248
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,791
It doesn't make any
difference, Babidi.

249
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,041
Just remember...

250
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,625
His purpose is to steal
energy for Majin Buu.

251
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,125
So why not let him
have his way, for now?

252
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,875
We will only have
the Supreme Kai

253
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,250
and the boy to worry about,
and I've already

254
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,041
shown I can handle them.

255
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,666
This way, you'll see the
Supreme Kai die at your feet

256
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,833
just as you had intended.

257
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,833
I can't believe it...

258
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,208
What kind of strength allows
a person to fight against

259
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,833
and overpower their
own enslaved body?

260
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,291
I guess I've been
keeping you waiting

261
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,833
for a long time, Vegeta.
But no more.

262
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,916
[DABURA]
Master, may I make a suggestion?

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,291
[BABIDI] Go ahead, Dabura.
But it better be good.

264
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,583
I'm feeling temperamental.

265
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,500
Let's open the doors for them...

266
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,375
That way we won't run the risk
of Buu's seal rupturing

267
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
before he's complete, and
besides I'd like to get my hands

268
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,000
on that boy as soon as I can.

269
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,958
Dabura... I think...
I won't kill you.

270
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

271
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,250
[GOHAN]
They're opening the ship for us!

272
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Careful, Gohan.

273
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,500
We must be watchful of traps.

274
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,416
Alright, Dad. I guess I'm off.

275
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,875
Take care, Gohan.

276
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't have to tell
you there's a lot

277
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,583
riding on this, so do your best.

278
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:33,416
Here. We've got two
Senzu Beans left.

279
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,833
I want you to take one.

280
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,333
You'll need to be
at full strength for

281
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,250
whatever happens down there.

282
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,041
Thanks. I'll do what I can.

283
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,875
Don't worry, son.

284
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,333
You've got all the power
you need to beat these guys.

285
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,333
Just remember how to
fight with your feelings

286
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
like you did against Cell.

287
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
Yeah... But how?

288
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,125
Just remember about all the
people you're fighting for

289
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,125
and how much you
care about them.

290
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,000
And then let that
be your weapon.

291
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,875
I've... I've missed
hearing you Dad...

292
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,500
It's a shame this one day for
you to be back had to get

293
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
so screwed up, but I'm
glad that you're here.

294
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,666
[GOHAN]
Let's go!

295
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,625
I'm ready now.

296
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,083
That's good to hear.

297
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:28,875
So, Kakarot...
The table has been set.

298
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,166
Now, let us begin!

299
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,916
[GOKU] The more time you
and I spend fighting,

300
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,458
the more damage I'll
receive to fuel Majin Buu.

301
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,708
So if it's all right with you,
let's just skip the warm-up.

302
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,000
By all means.

303
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,791
I just hope that
being dead this long

304
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,125
hasn't made your body fragile.

305
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,833
[growls]

306
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,125
[yells]

307
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,750
[VEGETA]
Well, at least you're stronger

308
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,291
than your son was against Cell.

309
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,166
[yells]

310
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,375
[gasps]

311
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,125
Wow, Vegeta...

312
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,791
This might take
longer than I thought.

313
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:30,291
You see! This is
our fate! Our battle!

314
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,000
[laughs]

315
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,083
[NARRATOR]
And so it has been decided.

316
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,333
Against the wishes
of the Supreme Kai...

317
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,791
Against the commands
of the wizard Babidi...

318
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,333
Goku and Vegeta have marked
off their battlefield,

319
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,666
and the last two survivors
