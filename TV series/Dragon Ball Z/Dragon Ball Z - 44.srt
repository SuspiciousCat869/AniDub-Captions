1
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,333
[VEGETA]
I can't give up!

2
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,333
Vegeta completed his recovery
and sped away to Planet Namek,

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,416
where he learned the evil
Frieza and his henchmen

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,916
were already searching
for the magic Dragon Balls

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,541
and the secret
to immortality.

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,125
Meanwhile, Bulma and
the gang found themselves

8
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,416
at the mercy of
Raiti and Zaacro,

9
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,083
as they began to
discover that things

10
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,625
were not what
they seemed!

11
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,541
It appears our heroes have been
caught in a web of deceit,

12
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,791
and this unexpected
snag in their search

13
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,875
for the Namekian Dragon Balls
could cost them dearly...

14
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,583
With Vegeta on
his way to Namek,

15
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,833
our heroes have
no time to lose!

16
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,791
Can they escape these
mysterious aliens? Stay tuned!

17
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,958
[GOHAN grunting]

18
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,041
Hang in there!

19
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,375
[GOHAN shouts]

20
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,291
[RAITI and ZAACRO laugh]

21
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,916
Don't worry, they're
night feeders,

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,750
so they won't
eat you now.

23
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,458
They'll just hold
you there 'til dark,

24
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,333
giving us
time to escape.

25
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,583
[BULMA] Hold on,
I'm confused.

26
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,958
The last I remember,
I was on Planet Namek.

27
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,375
Well, welcome to the
armpit of the universe.

28
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,916
We've become quite
familiar with it

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,625
since our ship
crashed here.

30
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,166
And believe me,
what you see around you

31
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,791
is as good
as it gets.

32
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,291
But just when we
had given up hope

33
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,500
of ever getting off
this smoldering rock,

34
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,625
along you came
to save the day,

35
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,666
bringing us a ship
that we could steal

36
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,125
and use for
our escape.

37
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
[ZAACRO] We planned to leave
with your ship that night,

38
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,458
but the conditions
weren't right,

39
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,125
so we bid our time
until they were.

40
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,291
We were simply, how do
you say, killing time.

41
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,125
We decided that we'd have a
little fun on your behalf

42
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,625
while we
were waiting,

43
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,375
and stumbled across
something better

44
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,166
than we could
have ever imagined.

45
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,875
[BULMA] But, this isn't
making any sense!

46
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,291
[ZAACRO] We brought you
three back to our home here.

47
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,833
A building culled from the
parts of our wrecked ship

48
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,416
and fashioned into a
makeshift laboratory.

49
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,041
[ZAACRO] I scanned you
and uncovered

50
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,500
some very
interesting information

51
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,541
about the Dragon Balls
you were searching for

52
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,000
and their location
on Planet Namek.

53
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,666
[RAITI and ZAACRO chuckling]

54
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,541
[BULMA] B-But then,
how did you...

55
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,791
I still don't
understand at all!

56
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,541
[ZAACRO] It was all
just an illusion.

57
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,041
[BULMA] Is this how you
guys get your kicks? Is it?!

58
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,833
[RAITI] You have to admit
it was pretty exciting.

59
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,083
[KRILLIN] You gotta
be kidding me!

60
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,833
You're not
taking our ship.

61
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,166
Is that right?

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,291
And what are you
going to do about it?

63
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,250
Your friends seem to be
all tied up at the moment.

64
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,708
[ZAACRO] But we don't really
have a taste for violence.

65
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:47,625
So let us leave and
we'll go peacefully.

66
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,916
We could have
taken your lives

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,458
before we took your
ship, but we didn't.

68
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,541
Instead we gave
you a little dream

69
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,166
to keep your attention
until we could sneak away.

70
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,500
You jerk.

71
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, the time is right
for us to make our escape.

72
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,916
Soon an opening
will form,

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,250
allowing a ship
to leave the planet.

74
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,875
Hey! Gimme that back!

75
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,375
You won't be
needing it anymore.

76
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,500
And I think we'll stop and
pick up the Dragon Balls

77
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,541
ourselves on
our way home.

78
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,625
And now you'll be left
stranded on this rock

79
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,000
waiting for someone
to happen by

80
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,416
and take you away
from this desolation.

81
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,125
[BULMA] You won't
get away with this!

82
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,875
You hear me?!

83
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,416
Don't just stand
there shouting!

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,708
Run after
them, hurry!

85
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,833
What exactly do you
expect me to do about it?!

86
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,916
I don't know!
But do something!

87
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,291
So, please tell me that you
know how to fly this thing.

88
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,541
Piece of cake.
It's all voice activated.

89
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,083
All I have to do is say
the word and we're off.

90
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,791
[ZAACRO]
Then do it already!

91
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,666
[RAITI] Here goes. Open up
and take us to Planet Namek!

92
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,416
[ZAACRO] Is that it?

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,000
[RAITI] I don't know!
Maybe it needs a secret word.

94
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,083
[thinking] They don't even
know how to open the door!

95
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,708
So much for
their escape plan.

96
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:30,250
[growling]

97
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,666
[KRILLIN grunting]

98
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,208
How you doing, Gohan?

99
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,333
[GOHAN] 
I... can't get loose!

100
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,500
[GOHAN] 
No! Krillin!

101
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,416
I'm coming.

102
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,000
[GOHAN yelling]

103
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,291
[thinking]
It's working!

104
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,958
Haah!

105
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,958
[thinking] I'm almost
there, Krillin.

106
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,625
Yeah!

107
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,666
Huh?

108
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,791
[RAITI] I tried that already!

109
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,208
[ZAACRO] Well, there's gotta be
some way to get into this ship.

110
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,583
[ZAACRO] Hurry, or
we'll miss our chance

111
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,166
to get out
of this hole!

112
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,833
[RAITI] I'll go get the girl and
make her tell us how to work it.

113
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,916
Oh, no! Gotta hide!

114
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,666
[BULMA sighs]

115
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,541
[screams]

116
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,916
[BOTH] Huh?

117
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,500
[BULMA laughing]

118
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,333
All right!

119
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,250
Yahoo!

120
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
[RAITI]
Now, open the door.

121
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,500
[ZAACRO] We don't have
any time to waste.

122
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,250
If this window of
opportunity closes

123
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,541
we won't be able to leave
again for another year.

124
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,833
But can't we work
something out?

125
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,041
Maybe I could drop
you off somewhere else.

126
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,291
But it'll take fifty years
to reach our home planet.

127
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,750
You sure you're
up for that?

128
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,041
Fifty years?!

129
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,500
[ZAACRO] Now, hurry!

130
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,208
I guess I have
no choice...

131
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,500
[BULMA clears throat]

132
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,041
[BULMA] Piccolo!

133
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,791
Superb!

134
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,625
Told you! All it needed
was the right password.

135
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,083
[BULMA shouts]

136
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,166
[BULMA whimpering]

137
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,458
Good luck. And besides,
it's really not bad here.

138
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,333
You'll have
lots of fun.

139
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,708
Oh, and remember,
don't drink the water,

140
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,416
and don't go out
alone after dark.

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,458
Do that,
you'll be fine.

142
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,791
[BOTH laughing]

143
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,625
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

144
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,583
[laughing continues]

145
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,041
[BOTH] Huh?

146
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
[RAITI] Impossible!

147
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,666
Whew... You made it.

148
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,166
We're heroes, that's
what we do, right?

149
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,333
[GOHAN growling]

150
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,958
Well, then...
Show us what you got.

151
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,083
[GOHAN and KRILLIN yelling]

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,375
That was a lot easier
than I expected.

153
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,875
Yeah.

154
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,416
[RAITI] We told you we didn't
have a taste for violence.

155
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,458
We weren't joking,
you know.

156
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,708
[BULMA] Oh no!

157
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,208
Looks like the
fog's clearing up.

158
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,541
If we don't
leave now,

159
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,291
then we won't be able
to for another year!

160
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,791
[BULMA] Piccolo.

161
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,458
Later fellas!

162
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,416
Without you we would've never
known how to escape from here.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,583
I guess we owe you one, then!
Thanks guys! Bye!

164
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Hey Bulma, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

165
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,875
Hang in there, Krillin.

166
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,000
Looks like we're in
for a bumpy ride.

167
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,166
I don't know if
we can make it.

168
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,291
We have to try.

169
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,000
Here we go!

170
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,000
[BULMA] We made it.

171
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,041
Now to make up for
all that lost time.

172
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,833
We're on to
Planet Namek,

173
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,375
and I'm gonna give
her all she's got.

174
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,458
We need to get
there in a hurry.

175
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,750
So what do we do now,
genius? Any bright ideas?

176
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:44,041
No, I'm pretty much
fresh out of bright ideas.

177
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,291
[BOTH sigh]

178
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,125
[BOTH] We'll never
get off this rock...

179
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,000
[VEGETA thinking]
Frieza... Ha!

180
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,791
He'll bow to me once I've
recovered the Dragon Balls.

181
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,000
And then no one will
stand in my way!

182
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:35,375
[CHICHI humming]

183
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,125
[CHICHI]
I was thinking, Goku...

184
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,583
What is it, ChiChi?

185
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,416
Our little boy's been gone
for almost a month now.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,333
Yeah, and...?

187
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:51,750
[CHICHI] And I think I forgot
to pack his toenail clippers.

188
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,166
I packed the
fingernail ones,

189
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,708
but they just don't work
for toes, you know.

190
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,541
[GOKU] I'm sure he'll make
do with what he's got.

191
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,083
Sheesh.

192
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,625
[GOKU yelling]

193
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,625
[chuckling]

194
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,666
[GOKU stuttering]

195
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,583
[laughing]

196
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,416
Nice day,
isn't it, doctor?

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
[BULMA] I can't believe it!
I thought we'd never make it.

198
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,083
Aah, beautiful!

199
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,166
Yeah, I've never seen
anything else like it.

200
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,041
And this time it's
the real Planet Namek.

201
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,708
I just got confirmation
from the computer system.

202
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,250
[GOHAN] We're here, and
only four days off schedule.

203
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,875
Yeah, well, our little
detour notwithstanding...

204
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,208
The shortcut those kids
told us about was right on!

205
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,583
Take us down, Bulma.
What are we waiting for?

206
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,458
You two! Now sit down
and put on your seat belts.

207
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,958
We're entering
an atmosphere,

208
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,083
not taking a ride
around the block.

209
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,666
So, strap in, and
hope for the best.

210
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,083
[grunting]

211
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,125
[KRILLIN shouting]

212
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,500
[BULMA]
A perfect landing!

213
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,583
Someone needs to
compliment me on my skills,

214
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,208
'cause I
sure got 'em!

215
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,166
[ALL laughing]

216
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,666
[BULMA] Now, I'll just use this
atmospheric sensor

217
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,958
I built back
on Earth.

218
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
It'll tell us whether
or not there's enough

219
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,958
breathable oxygen on
the planet's surface

220
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,291
for us to walk
around freely.

221
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,000
Or if we need
to wear suits.

222
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,416
I'm betting we'll
need those suits.

223
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,875
They'll work fine
for a short time.

224
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,416
After that, the air
tanks will deplete and...

225
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,875
Huh?

226
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,500
This place, you know,
except for the sky,

227
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,791
it doesn't really look all
that different from Earth...

228
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,666
Yeah, it does sorta
look like home.

229
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,375
But it's way
too quiet.

230
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,833
It kind of gives me
the creeps, you know?

231
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,833
I guess so.

232
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,750
What do you think you're
doing just walking around

233
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,791
before I say it's okay?!
You could have died!

234
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,041
What if you had walked outside

235
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,875
and there would've
been no oxygen?!

236
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,750
Well, freak out,
why don't you?

237
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,250
You're lucky. So from now on,
nobody moves until I say so.

238
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,375
I've picked up four
Dragon Balls already!

239
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,708
And they're
close, too...

240
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,958
[BULMA yelps]

241
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,041
What are
you doing?

242
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,333
Heh... I just
wanted to check

243
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,541
and make sure I wasn't
dreaming, you know?

244
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,750
Pinch yourself!

245
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,041
It's real.

246
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,500
[BULMA laughing]

247
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,833
Uh!

248
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,333
[BULMA and KRILLIN
laughing]

249
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,916
Hey, I'm sensing
something over there...

250
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,458
[laughing continues]

251
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,916
[BOTH] Huh?

252
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,500
Where?

253
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,958
[GOHAN] It's near,
and strong.

254
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,458
I feel it
too, Gohan.

255
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,875
And I don't like
it one bit.

256
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,458
You're worrying
yourselves over nothing.

257
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,458
Piccolo had a powerful
energy level,

258
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,708
it's only natural that his
fellow people would as well.

259
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,833
You're probably just sensing
one of Piccolo's relatives

260
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,166
while he's sitting at
his house having dinner.

261
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,250
But...

262
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,291
This energy's different,
it feels wrong.

263
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,541
[BULMA] Don't be silly!
The only people around here

264
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,458
are the local Namekians,
and they're peaceful.

265
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,708
They're no
threat to you.

266
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,916
Now, come on.
The Dragon Balls are this way.

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,458
If we get those we're
over half way there.

268
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,333
So let's go meet some locals
and collect some Dragon Balls.

269
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,958
Okay. You're, uh,
probably right.

270
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,791
We got ourselves
worked up over nothing.

271
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,333
Heh, heh! I'm kind of
embarrassed about it, actually.

272
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,041
[KRILLIN laughing]

273
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,291
[BOTH] Hmm?

274
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,208
Huh?

275
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,833
Wh-What kind of
ship is that?

276
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,958
[KRILLIN] It looks
like a Saiyan ship!

277
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,625
Now, I'm scared!

278
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,375
That's just great!

279
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,125
[BULMA] This can't
be happening!

280
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,541
It's just
a dream!

281
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,750
[KRILLIN] Gohan! Mask your
energy or he'll sense you.

282
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,708
Uh, right!

283
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,375
It's Vegeta!
It's gotta be.

284
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,125
Rrrgh...

285
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,250
Raagh!

286
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,500
[BULMA] Did you...
just say... Vegeta?

287
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,041
And he must be here
for the Dragon Balls.

288
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,250
What do we do? We can't
possibly fight Vegeta!

289
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:55,291
And if he gets the Dragon
Balls before us, we're doomed!

290
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,541
[KRILLIN] There's no
way we're gonna let him

291
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,916
get to them
before we do...

292
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,250
Bulma, you gotta leave now.
Go back to Earth alone.

293
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,416
We'll take care
of things here.

294
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,583
Just leave us your
Radar, and Gohan and I

295
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,583
will collect
the Dragon Balls.

296
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,916
But...

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,250
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.

298
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,666
I don't think we'll
get into any trouble...

299
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,375
We know what
we're doing.

300
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah!

301
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,416
[BULMA] I understand.

302
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,333
Sure, I'll leave you guys
here and go back to Earth,

303
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,041
but I'm coming
back with Goku.

304
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,541
But I think that you
guys should know,

305
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,000
that'll take
two months.

306
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,083
But what's two months,
anyways?! Just 60 days!

307
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,833
One thousand four
hundred and forty hours!

308
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,791
Eighty-six thousand four
hundred minutes!

309
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,083
Five million, one hundred
eighty-four thousand seconds...

310
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,875
right?!

311
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,541
Uh... yeah, it's only
two months.

312
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:46,333
[BOTH chuckling sheepishly]

313
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,333
It's time...

314
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,083
Time to remove the only
obstacle standing in my way.

315
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,333
Once the Dragon Balls
are in my possession,

316
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,166
all the power of
eternal life will be mine.

317
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,958
And then no one will
be able to stop me.

318
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,541
Not even the
mighty Frieza.

319
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,666
I'm already picking
up his power level.

320
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,625
So, he's near.

321
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:33,125
I'm coming for you, Frieza.
I sure hope you're ready.

322
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,958
[ROSHI] What?
What did you say?

323
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,375
Okay, got that...
Yes, go on...

324
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,083
[BULMA] You sure
you understand?

325
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
Tell Goku.
But whatever you do,

326
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,416
don't tell ChiChi.
She'll freak!

327
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,708
So, one more time.
Repeat it back to me.

328
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,708
[engine roaring in distance]
Okay, yeah... Good...

329
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,666
[engine roaring getting louder]
Keep going... Uh-huh.

330
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,125
No, you got that
part backwards!

331
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,500
Right! Did you
get all that?!

332
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,041
You better
have, old man!

333
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,875
What's going on?
Did I miss something?

334
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,875
[laughing sheepishly]

335
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,333
Uh... What?

336
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,291
[BULMA squealing]

337
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,416
Wah! W-Was that
Vegeta's ship again?

338
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,625
No, that's a
different ship this time.

339
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,166
For you,
Lord Frieza.

340
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,666
[FRIEZA] Very good.

341
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,291
Just three more
to go, now.

342
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,541
[FRIEZA laughing]

343
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,333
[laughing]

344
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,208
[NARRATOR]
What's this?

345
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:21,416
The evil tyrant Frieza and his
ruthless henchmen have already

346
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,625
gathered four of the seven
Namekian Dragon Balls!

347
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,500
And it seems there is nothing
to stand in the villain's way

348
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,708
of collecting the rest...
Even the mighty Vegeta,

349
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,291
with all of his
Saiyan strength,

350
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,916
is afraid to face
this foe head on!

351
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,208
Gohan and Krillin have
a monumental task

352
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,625
set before them.

353
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,833
Even if they can get to
the remaining Dragon Balls

354
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,666
before Frieza
or Vegeta,

355
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,750
they'll have to stay
alive for two months

356
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,291
before Bulma and
Goku can return!

357
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,791
The race is on...

358
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,583
And the fate of Planet Namek
hangs in the balance...

359
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,500
Next time, on
Dragon Ball Z!
