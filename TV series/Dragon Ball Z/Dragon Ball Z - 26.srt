00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,250
The battle
against the Saiyans

3
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,625
was not going well for
the Earth's heroes...

4
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,958
Yamcha was defeated by
the maniacal Saibamen.

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,541
And Chiaotzu made
the ultimate sacrifice

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,458
in a desperate attempt
to stop the evil Nappa.

7
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,041
[NARRATOR] Refusing
to go down quietly,

8
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,083
Tien summoned his last
remaining strength

9
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:38,500
to fire a mighty
blast at the Saiyan!

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,000
But when the
smoke cleared,

11
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,958
it seemed that even Tien's
finest efforts were not enough.

12
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,208
No... I failed...

13
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,125
[NARRATOR] Tien fell,

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,125
as the battle claimed yet
another casualty.

15
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,375
And with Goku still
nowhere to be found,

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,166
the remaining fighters' hopes
for survival were fading fast.

17
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,708
Nevertheless, Krillin and
Piccolo were determined

18
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,666
to stand their ground
to the bitter end!

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,541
I'll crush you!

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,791
[NARRATOR] But then,

21
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,625
as Nappa closed in for
the finishing blow...

22
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,500
Nappa!

23
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,375
[NARRATOR] The Saiyan, Vegeta,
called a surprise halt to

24
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,375
the fighting to await
Goku's return!

25
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,000
Ha! You think
Kakarot can beat us?

26
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,166
The battle resumes
in three hours,

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,750
whether Kakarot
is here or not.

28
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,541
[NAPPA growling]

29
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,958
I can't stand this, Vegeta!
Why are we waiting?

30
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,583
Because, I think we need to
teach Kakarot a little lesson.

31
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,708
[VEGETA] Kakarot was given
the chance to join us.

32
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,083
But he chose
to betray us...

33
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,666
He's forgotten what it
means to be a Saiyan.

34
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,416
And therefore..
He must be punished.

35
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,000
We're going to wait for him
to show his cowardly face...

36
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,750
Then we'll make him watch
while we kill his son

37
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,166
and all of
his friends.

38
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,166
[laughing]

39
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,625
And after he's
come to understand

40
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,333
the price of
his betrayal..

41
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,541
[laughing]

42
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,708
You and I can take our
time tearing him apart...

43
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,166
I like the way you think,
Vegeta! That's a great plan!

44
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,166
Of course, it all depends
on whether or not

45
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,666
he actually
decides to show up.

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,583
So if the guy doesn't
show in a couple hours,

47
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,125
I still get to kill
these three, right?!

48
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,750
No, Nappa!
Not all three.

49
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,416
We still need to
ask the Namek

50
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,250
about the Dragon
Balls. Got it?

51
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,333
Don't you worry about
a thing, Vegeta.

52
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,875
He'll be spillin' his guts
before I'm through with him.

53
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,791
[KRILLIN sighing]

54
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,750
What's the matter,
Krillin?

55
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,291
It's just... Goku should've
been here by now!

56
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,000
What's the deal? Was he
brought back to life or not?

57
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,958
[GOHAN]
Piccolo?

58
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,458
Hey! Why are we even
sticking around here, anyway?

59
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,208
We can't beat
these guys!

60
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,625
We should just run,
while we have the chance!

61
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,916
You can run...
But what's the point?

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,375
If we don't
stop them here,

63
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,000
you'll have to
face them eventually...

64
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,041
You might as well stay
and get it over with.

65
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,333
But... this is crazy!
We need Goku! Where is he?

66
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,291
He's the only one that
even has a chance

67
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,583
of stopping these guys!
Why isn't he here?!

68
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,458
Almost there!

69
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
Goku...

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,041
Please hold on,
guys! I'm coming!

71
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,708
So what do you suggest
we do, Piccolo?

72
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,125
What happens if Goku
doesn't make it?

73
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,250
Who knows?

74
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,541
[GOHAN, KRILLIN] Huh?

75
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,833
We all know that Goku
is on his way here.

76
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,541
Maybe he'll make it in the next
two hours, and maybe he won't.

77
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,375
But whether or
not he gets here,

78
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,208
we're going to have to
see our way through

79
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,625
this thing
together.

80
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,333
We can't just give up because
things aren't the way

81
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,875
we want
them to be.

82
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,500
[PICCOLO] We need to be
strong... It's up to us now.

83
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,125
I'm really sorry about
earlier, you guys.

84
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,833
I guess I just froze when
I saw him coming at me...

85
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,916
If it wasn't for me,
Tien would still be alive...

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,333
[PICCOLO]
It hurts, doesn't it?

87
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,708
Huh?

88
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,625
Facing your fears would have
been much less painful.

89
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,250
Hey, go easy on
him, Piccolo.

90
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,416
Y'know, given his
age and everything,

91
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,750
I think it's a miracle that
he's even out here at all!

92
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,958
I mean, if
it were me,

93
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,583
I probably would've
been long gone by now!

94
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,041
Thanks, Krillin...

95
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,166
Gohan, you know how to fight.
Remember your training!

96
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,083
But I'm
not ready!

97
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,666
We still have
two hours...

98
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,208
Maybe you can train me some
more while we're waiting!

99
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,791
The training
is complete!

100
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,791
I taught you everything
I know. Just go home!

101
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,958
But, Piccolo!

102
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,541
[KRILLIN stammering]

103
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,541
[KRILLIN]
Wait, Piccolo...

104
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,500
[thinking]
Gohan, it's true...

105
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,416
I taught you everything.
You're ready!

106
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,541
[KRILLIN]
Gohan, come back!

107
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,208
Wait a second.
We need you!

108
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,625
He doesn't really want you to
go... C'mon, tell him, Piccolo!

109
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,166
[GOHAN whimpering]

110
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,541
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

111
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,041
Huh?!

112
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,333
Ah!

113
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,791
[GOHAN screams]

114
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,125
[NAPPA] Hey,
you little brat!

115
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,250
You better
run home...

116
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,083
We wouldn't want
you getting hurt!

117
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,666
[laughing]

118
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,875
[GOHAN] You shut up,
you big bully!

119
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,625
I'm not running away!
You can't scare me anymore!

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,083
I was just going to go over
there to use the bathroom,

121
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,166
if that's okay
with you...

122
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,208
[GOHAN] You could use
a shower yourself...

123
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,541
What's that?
Speak up, kid!

124
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,541
Well?

125
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,916
Okay! I said...
You smell!

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,083
[gasps]

127
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,166
[NAPPA growling]

128
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,708
[NAPPA] Why you little runt!
How dare you?!

129
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,541
You're brave now, but we'll
see what happens in two hours!

130
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,000
[NAPPA growling]

131
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,583
[CAMERAMAN] All right,
I've got 'em! You're on!

132
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,416
[NEWSCASTER] As you can
see, each side appears

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,958
to be waiting
for something.

134
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,000
The three remaining members
of the Earth's Special Forces

135
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
have already defeated
six deadly green men!

136
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,208
But they seem to have
reached a stalemate

137
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,791
with the large
muscular alien!

138
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,958
Let's move
in closer!

139
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,083
Thus far, it appears
the smaller alien

140
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,833
has not joined in
any of the fighting!

141
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,041
We are currently attempting
to approach the battlefield

142
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,583
to get a better
view of the aliens

143
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,375
now that the action
has subsided.

144
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,000
Perhaps we will also
gain some insight

145
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,958
as to why the cease-fire
has been called.

146
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,708
But for the moment, the reasons
for this lull in the fighting

147
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,041
are anybody's guess.

148
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,333
Why do you think
they're waiting?

149
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,833
I'm not too sure...
It doesn't make sense.

150
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,541
But whatever the
reason, with any luck,

151
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,041
perhaps they'll
wait long enough

152
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,916
for Goku to
make it back.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,041
Let's just hope Goku's
strong enough to beat them...

154
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,375
He will be! Goku's
never lost a fight.

155
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,958
Not when everything's
on the line!

156
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,250
[OOLONG] But these
guys are aliens!

157
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
What if he's not
strong enough?

158
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,500
I mean, what's
gonna happen to us?

159
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,250
Come on, tell me the
truth! I can take it!

160

Well, what do
you think?

161

Those Saiyans aren't here
on vacation, you know.

162
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,708
They want to take over
our planet and sell it!

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,833
It'll be the end of the

[OOLONG groaning]

No! Please! I don't
want it to end!

Oh, I can't
take it.

167
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,500
Why did you have to go and
tell me that, Bulma?

168
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,000
You know that I'm highly
allergic to danger!

169
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,833
You mean that
you're a coward!

Uh, i-it's a
medical condition!

171
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,125
Right, your selfishness
produces a chemical

172
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,750
in your brain that
causes extreme fear!

Where am I?

174
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,041
ChiChi, you're here!
You'll be okay.

Oh, Dad...
Is Gohan alright?

177
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,416
He's just fine!

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,208
Yeah, the
fighting's stopped!

179
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,541
[CHICHI]
It's all over?

180
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,166
[ROSHI] No, they're
taking a break!

What? But why?

We don't know, hon.

183
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,458
Where in the
world is Goku?

184
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,458
Now, now, please, ChiChi!
You need to try and stay calm!

185
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,416
You know Goku, dear...
Wherever he is,

186
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,916
he's trying his absolute
best to get there!

187
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
Hmph! Look at those
nosy human beings!

188
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,958
Hey, do you mind if I go
have a little fun, Vegeta?

189
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,250
'Cause I'm bored!

190
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,958
Why not?
But save some energy.

191
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,583
With Kakarot here, things
could get intense!

192
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,875
You think so?

193
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,250
Well, maybe. He is
one of us, after all.

194
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,041
Hmm. Sounds good.
I can't wait!

Alright! I won't even
break a sweat! I promise!

196
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,500
[NEWSCASTER] It looks like
the large alien is airborne!

197
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,583
This one has done all
of the fighting so far,

198
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,375
and has attacked several
press vehicles as well!

199
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,958
He is considered to
be highly dangerous!

[NEWSCASTER] Uh... He appears
to be heading toward us!

right over our heads!

me a cold washcloth!

Darn it! I knew it
was gonna be easy...

00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,125
Gohan! While I'm
holding his tail

316
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,083
I want you to attack
him! Full force!

317
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,500
But... I don't
know, Piccolo.

318
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
I mean, what
happens if I miss?

319
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,583
You won't miss...
Don't worry.

320
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,666
You have all you need
to get the job done,

321
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,125
I promise
you that!

322
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:39,833
[GOHAN whimpering]

323
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,000
[thinking] All right!
I gotta hand it to Piccolo...

324
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,708
Even now, he's still trying
to win this thing for us...

325
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,291
At least we have a
little hope left.

326
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,083
Gohan, shake it off!

327
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
What you did before
was only natural,

328
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,375
but you're ready now.
We can see that.

329
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,541
[PICCOLO] I have full
confidence in you.

330
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,250
[KRILLIN]
Me, too, Gohan!

331
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,958
[NAPPA chuckling]

332
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,291
[GOHAN growling]

333
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,875
Huh?

334
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,333
[GOKU] Kami?

335
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,333
Goku!

336
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,416
[GOKU] Are we ready?

337
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,083
Yes! Grab my arm!

338
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,875
'Kay! Let's go!

339
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:34,250
He-He did it! Wow... I thought
I'd never see him again!

340
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,250
I guess the Earth
does have a chance!

341
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,083
Wish I could stay
and chat, guys...

342
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,416
But I gotta go
save the world!

343
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,541
[MR. POPO]
Good luck, Goku!

344
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,625
Remember...
Every second counts!

345
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:01,458
All right! Goku is such a
wild man! Check him out!

346
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,791
[GOKU]
Korin!

347
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,333
What?!

348
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,541
[GOKU] I need
some Senzu Beans!

349
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,375
[KORIN] Right! These are
my last two, Goku! Catch!

350
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,500
[GOKU]
Got 'em!

351
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,000
Thanks, Korin!

352
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,291
Bye!

353
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,083
[KORIN]
Give 'em hell, Goku!

354
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,083
Yeah! Much better!

355
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,375
Nimbus!

356
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,250
[GOKU]
There you are!

357
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,708
They're here, alright!
I can feel it! That way!

358
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,333
Come on, Nimbus!
Let's go!

359
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,708
[NARRATOR]
Goku's back!

360
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,458
But is he already too
late to save his friends?

361
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:55,375
