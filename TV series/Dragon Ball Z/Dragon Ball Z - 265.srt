00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,000
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,750
Majin Buu became furious

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,666
when his every attempt to
defeat the powered-up Gohan

4
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,833
proved useless.

5
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,208
Gohan was clearly
the superior fighter,

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,375
and it seemed Buu's
destructive spree

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,833
would at last come to an end.

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,666
[NARRATOR] But the crazed Buu
put an abrupt stop to the fight

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,333
by turning himself
into a living bomb,

10
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,583
apparently trying
to take Gohan with him.

11
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,583
[NARRATOR]
Gohan survived,

12
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,666
and in the following calm,
lost friends were reunited.

13
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,625
[PICCOLO] You're alive.
I don't know how you did it.

14
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,750
[NARRATOR]
But a dark cloud on the horizon

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,541
put a damper on the reunion,

16
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:02,583
as Majin Buu returned from
hiding, only one hour later...

17
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,791
[NARRATOR] ...and delivered
a puzzling request.

18
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,458
[SUPER BUU laughs]

19
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,500
Come on then, little worms.
I want to fight you now!

20
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,500
[ALL gasp]

21
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,541
[GOHAN]
That is not gonna happen!

22
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,166
You're fighting me, Buu.
You got it?

23
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,291
What happened boys? Don't tell
me you're scared to fight Buu.

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,125
[TRUNKS, GOTEN growl]

25
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,458
[SUPER BUU]
You were raring to go before.

26
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,291
[NARRATOR] What sinister
trick does Majin Buu

27
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,250
have hiding behind his back?

28
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,541
Find out now, on Dragon Ball Z!

29
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:02,666
[TRUNKS, GOTEN grunting]

30
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:16,458
[SUPER BUU chuckling]

31
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,916
Oh I'm sorry,
I must of misjudged you.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,375
What's he saying?

33
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,666
I think he's trying
to say we're weak!

34
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,916
Then I guess he doesn't
remember us kicking his butt.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,791
I wouldn't say we're
down for the count just yet.

36
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
We just thought
Gohan deserved a shot.

37
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,625
[SUPER BUU]
Ah, I see,

38
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,208
for a moment I thought
you were hiding behind him.

39
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:41,250
Now why don't you do your little
magic so we can get started?

40
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,541
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Fine!

41
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
Ha, I'm ready.

42
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,000
With Gohan on our side,
there's no way we'll get beat.

43
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,916
Yeah, and I'm sick and tired
of hearing this pink guy

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
run his big, goofy mouth!

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,958
[PICCOLO] Goten, Trunks,
hold your ground for a moment.

46
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm sensing some kind of...

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,958
...deception.

48
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,250
C'mon, Piccolo,
you gotta be kidding.

49
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,416
he's not smart enough
for something like that.

50
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,291
He can't even spell deception.

51
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
Let's go!

52
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,625
No! Come back!

53
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,625
[GOTEN] Hey, you can't
spell that word, either.

54
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,208
[TRUNKS]
Shut up!

55
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,625
There, you got what
you asked for, Majin Buu.

56
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,291
Gotenks is back in the ring!

57
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,458
[GOHAN]
No, Trunks, you two stay back.

58
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,916
I'm dealing with this myself.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,166
[GOTEN] But, ah, come on!
We're really good.

60
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,083
[squelching]

61
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,833
[TRUNKS]
This stinks!

62
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,541
We can't just stand here
and watch. I wanna fight!

63
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,583
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

64
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:50,416
[growling]

65
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
[BEE barks]

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,791
Don't worry about
a thing, Gohan,

67
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
you haven't seen me
and Trunks in action yet.

68
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,875
When we do fusion,
we're unbeatable!

69
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,958
Watch this, okay?

70
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,000
[SUPER BUU thinking]
That's it boys.

71
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,458
Do your little fusion for me.

72
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,875
Now, are you ready, Goten?

73
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,250
Yeah!

74
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,583
[GOTEN] This time, we
should definitely start off

75
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,375
as Super Saiyan Three!

76
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,333
Fu...

77
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,291
Fu...

78
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,666
...sion!

79
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,708
Ha!

80
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:39,125
Whoa, so that's
what fusion looks like.

81
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,166
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

82
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,125
[GOTENKS]
Yeah!

83
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
Sorry you were
missing me, ugly,

84
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,250
but now I'm back,
and stronger than ever.

85
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,958
Now, that's weird.

86
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,416
First there were two kids,
and now there's one,

87
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,541
and he's got blonde hair
instead of... What's goin' on?!

88
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
[SUPER BUU thinking]
The power of Gotenks

89
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,916
and the mind of Piccolo.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,708
Unstoppable.

91
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,750

[barks]

94
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,208
[MR. SATAN] It just doesn't
make sense to me.

95
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,416
If two kids became one,
uh, they'd be twice as big.

96
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,916
--Right?
--[BEE growling]

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,500
Look, I'm pretty hungry too, but
right now, there's this fight.

98
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,458
And I'm tryin' to figure out
this other thing

99
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,458
all at the same time.

00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,458
Well, Gohan,

102
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,458
I hope you don't mind
if I take it from here.

103
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,166
You're looking like you
could use a little break.

104

[chuckles]

105
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,291
I'll beat on Buu
for a little while.

[grunts]

107
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,125
Then, I might be nice enough to
give you another shot at him.

108
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,875
Nice attitude, you've definitely
got some Vegeta in you.

[MR. SATAN gasping]

144
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,666
[MR. SATAN]
Does that mean he's gonna

145

run around and absorb us all?

146
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,500
He might. He went after
Gotenks and Piccolo,

147
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,333
so we know he's absorbing
the bravest fighters.

find us back here.

So, Gohan, what
do you think of it?

150
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:02,250
New clothes to match my figure,
and a few new abilities as well!

I suppose the sudden loss
of your friends and family

has left you speechless, Gohan.

tears so we can fight.

00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,083
How could you do that to them?

157
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,708
They've been fair in
this fight since the start.

158
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
I'm not interested in fairness,

159
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,583
I'm interested in the extinction

160

of every living creature
on this planet.

161
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,375
A good fighter knows his mental
and physical limitations,

162
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,250
but a great fighter will
figure a way around them.

163
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,666
From the moment I felt your
power, I knew I was beaten.

164
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,416
And then I thought
about something,

165
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,541
if I could hatch a plan to
absorb Piccolo and Gotenks

166
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,791
and their powers,

167
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
then no force on this
boring, pathetic planet

168
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,916
would ever stand a chance
against me again.

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,791
And then another important
factor was revealed. Time...

170
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,500
[GOTENKS]
I've only got five more minutes,

171
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,166
then we'll have to wait an hour
until I can do fusion again!

172
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,583
You'd be smart
to show your face.

173
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,666
Here I am about to lose
all of my powers,

174
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,250
and be helpless to
defend myself. Really!

175
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,500
It's just poor,
little Gotenks here,

176
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,125
all by his lonesome,
unable to fight back at all.

177
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,791
[SUPER BUU] Individually, the
boys were worthless to me,

178
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,833
but together, they have the
strength to make me invincible.

179
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,375
So, I decided to
wait out the hour

180
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,458
until they could do their
little fusion trick again.

181
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,291
Then all I had to do
was get them angry.

182
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:08,750
Tch. Well, you got
me angry, too.

183
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,708
You know,
if you wanted the best,

184
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,125
you should've come after me.

185
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,166
You just absorbed the
wrong Super Saiyans, Buu.

186
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,166
And if you're using
Piccolo's brains,

187
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
you know you've
got thirty minutes

188
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,791
until this newfound
strength of yours defuses.

189
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,250
[SUPER BUU laughs]

190
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,958
I assure you, it will
be over before then.

191
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,916
And I didn't absorb you
because I needed a punching bag.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,625
What's the point
of having strength

193
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,083
if there's nothing to hit?

194
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,333
I kept you around because
I'm stronger than ever,

195
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,250
and I have to try it on someone.

196
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,125
Sounds fine, I'm all yours.

197
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,875
Let's do this.

198
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,208
All right,

199
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,833
but be warned,
in my new super form

200
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,541
I have the body of Buu,
the intensity of Gotenks,

201
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,166
and all the cunning of a Namek

202
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,375
ready to drive the nails
into your coffin.

203
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,541
I'm tougher than Gotenks
and smarter than Piccolo.

204
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,875
So, I guess, the only thing
you have to worry about

205
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,375
is if I'm stronger than you.

206

You know I'm going
to kill you, Gohan.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,375
Well let's hold off on
the gravestone, Majin Buu.

I thought they
were droppin' bombs.

232
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,541
There's no army. Gohan and
Majin Buu are fighting.

233
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,166
All those explosions
from two guys?

234

They don't even look like
they've taken a single punch.

gonna come after me?

Uh-huh, if you're a strong guy,
I think he might.

Well, he'll surely
be looking for you.

242
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
[SUPER BUU] It seems you're
weaker than you thought.

243
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,958
Is your confidence
dwindling yet?

244

There's no shame
in quitting here.

You can just walk away
whenever you want.

Your mind games aren't
gonna work on me, Buu.

I've been trained
much better than that.

Now let's go again!

why my little brother

He doesn't.

If fact, he wonders
why you let me take him.

Ah!

[SUPER BUU] Your old teacher
Piccolo isn't impressed, Gohan.
