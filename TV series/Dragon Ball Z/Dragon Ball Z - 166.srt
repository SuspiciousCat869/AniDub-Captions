00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,166
Trunks pushed his strength
to record-breaking levels.

3
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,750
But the Saiyan's bulky
muscles made him too slow

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,083
to land a decent punch.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,333
Giving Cell the advantage.

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,708
[NARRATOR] Down but not out,

7
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Trunks got back on his feet and
was ready to go another round,

8
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,458
but Cell had
other plans in mind.

9
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,833
[CELL] How did you
get so strong?

10
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,333
I can't believe you developed
those fighting skills

11
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,000
in such a short time.

12
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,416
If I gave you more time,
could you get stronger?

13
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,041
Maybe! Why do you
want to know?

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,541
Because there is going
to be a tournament!

15
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,500
Each member of your
team may challenge me.

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,333
I will fight them one-on-one.

17
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,458
It should be very entertaining!

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,833
[CELL chuckles]

19
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,458
[NARRATOR] Cell has allowed
the young Saiyan live,

20
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,125
but now he must take part
in a deadly tournament

21
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,416
to decide the course
of the future.

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,291
The countdown begins...
today on Dragon Ball Z!

23
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,708
[CELL] This tournament
will be a guaranteed hit.

24
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,375
Everyone will be watching me...

25
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,541
I can't wait to see that
look of panic and fear!

26
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,166
That's it! That's the look!

27

[KRILLIN] Hey, look down
there! Is that Trunks?

33
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Yeah, that's him.
What's he doing?

34
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:47,541
Hey, where's Cell? He's not
there! He's gone! Where is he?

35
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,916
Hey, wait for me!

36
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,416
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,333
[VEGETA] Tell me,
what happened to Cell?

38
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,750
[TRUNKS] I tried to beat him...
I couldn't do it!

39
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,708
It's okay. Take it easy.
What happened here?

40
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,875
[VEGETA] Tell us what
happened... now!

41
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,375
I lost... his power
is much greater than mine!

42
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,166
[VEGETA laughs]

43
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,125
[VEGETA] Of course it is!

44
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,208
Foolish boy, what made you
think you could take on Cell

45
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,958
now that he's complete?

46
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,958
Hey! Trunks saved
your life, Vegeta,

47
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,958
and already his power
level is way beyond--

48
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,000
No, Krillin!

49
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,458
Huh?!

50
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,958
Hmph?

[BULMA] There, there, now
don't cry, Baby Trunks.

54
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,291
[crying continues]

55
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,541
[BULMA] Hey, what
are you waiting for?!

56
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,000
Trunks needs your help!

57
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,166
He could be hurt or even worse!

58
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,625
What's happening
down there anyway?

59
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,916
[PICCOLO] Don't worry,
Trunks is still alive.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,375
Are you sure?!

61
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,916
Huh? And Cell?

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,625
[PICCOLO] I thought Trunks was
going to beat Cell for sure.

63
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,708
His power had grown to
such an incredible level.

64
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,333
Yet, Cell's complete power
was still too much for him.

65
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,208
We must find a way to beat Cell!

66
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,750
Perhaps it's time I entered
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber

67
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,666
for some intensive
training of my own.

68
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,166
[KRILLIN] What?
A Martial Arts Tournament?!

69
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,583
Mm-hmm...

70
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
Uh? Are you sure about that?

71
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:58,208
[thinking] Cell! So he wants to
try and humiliate me again.

72
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,750
[KRILLIN] So... what's the deal?
Who's gonna be in this?

73
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,166
I mean, nobody can beat Cell,

74
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,916
so it won't be much
of a tournament.

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,375
[TRUNKS] Yes, you're right...
I thought I could beat him.

76
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,250
I was certain I could
do it, but I failed.

77
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,333
Maybe he is unstoppable...

78
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,625
Wait! Of course!

79
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,291
When Goku and Gohan get out of
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

80
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,625
I'll go back in again
and continue my training!

81
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,541
Huh?!

82
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,375
There's no need
for you to do that!

83
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,250
I will be the one who goes
back inside that room...

84
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
then I'll beat Cell!

85
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,666
[ANDROID 16] I will also fight.

86

Yeah, well he's also a
living being, and I think

105
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,333
he deserves a second chance.

What? She's not back from Kami's
place yet? Wow, that's strange.

162
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,208
[ROSHI] Hello, down there!

163
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, Master Roshi!

164
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,375
You made it!

165
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,916
[ROSHI] Mm-hmm.

166
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,916
Bulma told us to meet her here
at the Capsule Corporation.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,750
So, uh... here we are.

168
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,541
What's this all about, Krillin?
Come on, what's going on?

169
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,416
Where's Gohan?

170
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,708
[KRILLIN gasps]

171
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,750
[KRILLIN] He's still
training at Kami's place.

172
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,666
[CHICHI sighs]

173
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,791
Great...

174
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,166
[DR. BRIEF] Let's see... Hmm...

175
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,333
Mm-hmm... Hmm...

176
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,708
Ah! Now, let's put that there...

177
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,250
Hm? Ahhh...

178
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,916
Uh-Oh! That doesn't look right!

179
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,416
For real? He wants a tournament?

180
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
That's what Cell said.

181
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,958
He told me to watch the
television for details.

182
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,708
Can anyone who wants
enter the competition?

183
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,291
[TRUNKS] He'll take on anyone
who challenges him...

184
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,666
and he expects to have a battle
with each of us. One-by-one.

185
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,916
Of course, you know what
he's trying to do? I do.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,541
His plan is to eliminate the
competition once and for all.

187
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,250
Well, I kinda like the idea of
another Martial Arts Tournament.

188
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,166
I mean, hey...
I think I'll dominate!

189
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, let's get 'em!

190
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,041
Yeah!

191
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,208
Just make sure you
don't get another hand

192
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,375
through your stomach!

193
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,750
[BOTH groan]

194
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
[MRS. BRIEF] There ya go!

195
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,875
[MRS. BRIEF giggles]

196
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,583
Hold on... now wasn't there a
martial arts tournament

197
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,750
a long time ago?

198
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,166
That's correct... ahh, yes,

199
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,458
I believe I'll explain since I
once won the tournament myself.

200
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,083
--[VEGETA] Hmph!
--[PUAR] What? Master Roshi?

201
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,583
I never knew you won it!

202
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,041
Oh, you just had
to get him started!

203
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,208
[ROSHI coughs]

204
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,541
Alright, I'm sure
you've all heard of the

205
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,666
World Martial Arts Tournament.

206
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,708
It was a contest held to decide
the world's greatest fighter.

207
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,625
Masters of the
Martial Arts gathered

208
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,583
from all over the world to
take place in the competition.

209
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,750
I believe Goku first appeared
in the 21st tournament.

210
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,250
And went all the way
to the final round.

211
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,250
However, his last
opponent was Jackie Chun,

212
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:35,083
an unbeaten master who proved
Goku still had a lot to learn.

213
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,416
Five years later,

214
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,250
the 22nd World Martial
Arts Tournament was held.

215
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,875
That's where Goku met
Tien and Chiaotzu.

216
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,541
It was Goku and Tien
in the final round

217
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,041
and it was a doozy of a battle.

218
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,750
They both gave it
everything they had,

219
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,875
but neither could
out do the other.

220
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,708
Goku narrowly missed
becoming the champion...

221
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,166
and they had to call it a draw.

222
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,125
Ha! That's not much
of a competition...

223
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,166
Now I know why
Kakarot got involved

224
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,375
in such an easy tournament.

225
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,000
[KRILLIN &amp; YAMCHA growl]

226
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,958
No... It's not that the
competition was easy...

227
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,958
There were just factors involved
that made it more difficult.

228
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,666
You know, love has a way
of throwing everything

229
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,583
out of perspective.

230
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,208
By the time the 23rd
tournament came around,

231
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,250
Goku had married ChiChi.

232
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,416
Piccolo was on the scene
and showed some moves

233
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,791
that were really
out of this world.

234
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,250
This was a competition
that separated the

235
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,166
tough guys from the wimps.

236
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,666
Goku made it to the finals, but
not before facing some of his

237
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,500
fiercest opponents.

238
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,666
Toughest of all was Piccolo.

239
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,625
Those two fought with everything
they had and it looked like

240
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,250
Piccolo would claim the title
of the world's greatest fighter.

241
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,041
But anyone who knows Goku, knows
you can never count him out...

242
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
even when things
look their bleakest.

243
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,916
The result of their battle left
the tournament rink destroyed

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,791
and the surrounding area
in a shambles.

245
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,083
That's why there hasn't been a
World Martial Arts

246
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
Tournament since.

247
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,541
In the end, when all was said
and done, Goku was declared

248
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,958
the strongest fighter
on the Earth!

249
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:15,375
10... 12... how many years
ago was that, Krillin?

250
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,291
Quite a few! Heh!

[CROWS cawwing]

257
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,875
But why would Cell
host a tournament?

258
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,791
Yeah, why? I mean, if he
wants to rule the world

259
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,666
why's he wasting time
with this competition?

260
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,291
Cell doesn't want to rule the
world, he wants to destroy it.

--[YAMCHA gasps]
--[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

The androids have never
been interested in power.

263
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,916
It's just that
they find pleasure

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,166
in causing fear and chaos.

265
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,166
And Cell's no different, he's
using this stupid tournament

266
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,000
as a way to spread fear!

he's got some nerve!

out that windbag for good!

If it's a tournament,
it will have to have rules

that even Cell
must follow, right?

[TRUNKS] Cell wants to test the
limits of his complete body.

He's uncertain about
the Super Saiyans,

293
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,833
and we must use that
to our advantage.

But I refuse to let

302
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,250
[KRILLIN] But ChiChi,
you said yourself

303
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,708
that killing wouldn't be aloud!
So what's the big deal?

00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,458
[CHICHI] I do not want Gohan
entering that tournament!

305
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,250
He is not going to be a
fighter like his father!

306

We need him...

307
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,625
Goku and I have already
talked about this.

We made a deal.

309
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,583
Gohan can go and train,
but when he gets back

310
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,208
he's going to have to
buckle down and hit the books.

really could use his help!

and I'm not going to change it!

00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,083
[GOKU] Lunch time, kiddo.

318
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,000
[GOHAN babbles]

319
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,541
Gohan, someday you'll grow
up to be a great scholar.

320
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,958
A scholar?!

321
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,375
Goku, there's no reason
for him to have to fight...

322
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,250
If we raise him to be
a scholar, then he'll really

323
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,250
be able to help people.

324
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,041
I guess so...

325
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,916
Guess I'll have to take
back those training weights...

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,791
So there! Gohan will
have to start his studies

327
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,500
right when he gets back...

328
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,500
And he will not be joining
up with your little gang!

329
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,541
Our gang?!

330
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
What gang?

331
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,500
Hey! Can I join?

332
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,250

[GOKU snores]

[birds chirping]

335
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,166
Perfect. This looks
like an ideal spot.

336
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,000
Now, to build a ring.

337
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,750
[sighing]

338
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,375
Now, let's see...

339
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,541
I'll have to clear some
of this land away first.

340
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,708
Perfect.

341
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,916
Ah... I like it...
It will make a strong floor.

342
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:32,500
Yes... This will do just fine...
It looks large enough.

343
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,875
It's time, to get the word out.

344
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,625
[NARRATOR} The stage
has been set.

345
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,666
The tournament
is about to begin.

346
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,958
Soon the Z Warriors
will learn where the next

347
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,083
World Martial Arts
Tournament will be held...

348
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,541
Are they ready to take on an
monster like Cell one-by-one?

349
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,250
Will Cell play by the rules?
Will there be any rules?!

350
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,666
Find out next time!
