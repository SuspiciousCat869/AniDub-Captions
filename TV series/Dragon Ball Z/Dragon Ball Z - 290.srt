1
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,916
much to the dismay of Bulma,

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,208
the training continued
and took precedence over all!

4
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,208
[NARRATOR] A new World
Championship Tournament

5
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,375
was about to begin

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,875
and the contenders
were coming to the fore!

7
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:32,125
Grandpa! I just flew around
the world again! Good, huh?

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,083
Yeah! I think that was
your fastest time yet, Pan!

9
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,083
Think I'll be ready
for tomorrow then?

10
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,625
[NARRATOR] Were the tough
teenagers being upstaged

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,125
by the tenacious toddler?

12
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,166
And who was the mystery fighter
that Goku had gotten wind of?

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,750
Someone so powerful

14
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,041
that even he was looking
forward to the challenge!

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,125
No, I think this
guy is really shrewd.

16
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,750
We may have
ourselves a challenge.

17
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,750
[GOTEN]
Get out of here!

18
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,125
That girl over there?
I don't believe you!

19
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,500
[TRUNKS]
No! I'm serious!

20
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,166
We're going out tonight
after the tournament!

21
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,333
[CAPTAIN CHICKEN]
Buck, baawk! Buck baawk!

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,333
[UUB thinking]
Gosh! I didn't realize

23
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,541
there were so many
people in this world!

24
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,333
[KNOCK]
Hey, kid!

25
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,875
[UUB shrieks]

26
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,083
Relax!

27
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,833
Sorry!

28
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,166
[KNOCK]
Sorry, huh?

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,875
Well, don't be! So tell me!

30
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,458
How did a little twerp like you
make it past the preliminaries?

31
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,375
Maybe I was
just lucky, I guess.

32
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,291
Heh! Happens every time!

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,916
Every tournament there's
a few little squirts

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,958
that make it to the finals!

35
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,250
The funny thing is,

36
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,541
that one there makes
you look like a giant!

37
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,583
Oweee! Ow!

38
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,250
[WILD TIGER]
Did you do that?

39
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,416
I think you did. Didn't you?

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,791
Ohhh... I see.
Messin' with Wild Tiger?

41
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,625
Well, that's not
too smart. Dumb kid.

42
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,208
[chuckles]

43
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,583
[PAN sobs]
Grandpa!

44
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,875
Hahahaha!

45
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,000
[GOKU]
Hmm?

46
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,958
Hey, Pan. Don't cry.
It's just a game.

47
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:25,416
[ANNOUNCER] All right! It's
time to get the ball rolling!

48
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,375
The fighters will now draw lots

49
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,666
to see who will be matched up
with whom in the first round

50
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,916
of the finals!

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,375
This is a single-match
elimination tournament,

52
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
which means that
the losers go home

53
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,166
and the winners will
move on to the next round!

54
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,166
The winner of the final round

55
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,958
will proceed to the
Championship Match!

56
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,833
There he or she will
have the honor of competing

57
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,208
for the World Title
against the reigning

58
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,500
Champion of the World:
Mr. Satan!

59
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,333
Hey! Do you think the amazing
guy your dad was going on about

60
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,791
is really one of these?

61
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,333
Huh?

62
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,208
[TRUNKS]
They all seem kind of normal!

63
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, well, there's one
of them that's not so normal!

64
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,958
Come on! Which
one is it, Kakarot?

65
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,541
Nope! Not tellin'!

66
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,416
[ANNOUNCER]
Now then! Fighters!

67
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,708
As I call your name, please
come up and draw a number!

68
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,416
The first fighter is Goten!

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,666
That's me!

70
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,166
Well, come on up!

71
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,375
[GOKU]
Hey, Buu!

72
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,500
[BUU]
Hmm?

73
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,041
I'd like you to
do me a little favor,

74
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,041
but you're gonna
have to use your magic.

75
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,291
[BUU]
Hmm?

76
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,416
Listen! I want you to
change the lot numbers

77
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
so I can fight this certain guy!

78
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,458
Will you do it?

79
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,625
Ahh! Okay! Buu do!

80
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,083
It's not like you to
break the rules, Kakarot!

81
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,458
I know! But I want to fight
this guy in the first round!

82
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,791
That way we'll both be
at one hundred percent

83
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,708
and it'll be a
totally fair match!

84
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,750
[GOTEN]
Here goes nothing!

85
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,583
[ANNOUNCER] Eight!
Goten has drawn number eight!

86
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,000
And the next fighter
to draw is Wild Tiger!

87
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:13,458
Yeah! Let me at
those numbers! Mmmm! Uhhh!

88
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,208
Come to Wild Tiger,
you little, round rascals!

89
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,125
[BULMA] Whoa! I wouldn't want
to be matched up with that guy!

90
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,708
[ANDROID 18] Aah! He's nothing!
Just a paper tiger!

91
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,416
Even Krillin could
beat a guy like that!

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,125
[KRILLIN] Oh well, thanks a lot!
That's a heck of a thing to say!

93
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,416
[ANDROID 18]
Well, you should have entered.

94
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,083
You might have
won some prize money.

95
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,541
Even I could have
been the World Champion

96
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,750
if I hadn't let Mr. Satan win.

97
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, well what about Goku
and Vegeta withdrawing that year

98
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,791
to go fight Majin Buu!

99
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,750
Pan entered!
You're just a whimp!

100
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,958
[KRILLIN thinking]
Man! She's harsh!

101
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,000
Look! Pan's gonna
go pick a number, Mom!

102
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,333
Here she comes! The youngest
fighter in the tournament!

103
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,833
Now which one will it be?

104
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,958
Is it time for Buu
to use his sneaky magic?

105
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,166
[GOKU]
Not yet, Buu!

106
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,291
Yes! Number One!

107
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,166
Young Pan has picked Number One!

108
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,458
One! Then Pan's
gonna fight Two!

109
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,125
Which fighter is Number Two?

110
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,166
What? Holy smoke!

111
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,166
Pan's fighting that
gorilla, Wild Tiger!

112
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,458
[PAN] Number One!
Number One! Number One! Yay!

113
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,041
Hmph!

114
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,833
And the next fighter
to draw is Goku!

115
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,333
Let's do it!

116
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,375
[GOKU thinking]
Hmm! There's an open bracket!

117
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,125
[GOKU]
Buu! Make mine Number Three!

118
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,958
Okay!

119
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,000
Hi!

120
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,583
Long time no see!

121
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,875
The competitions just haven't
been the same without you, Goku!

122
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
It's good to be back!

123
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,000
[ANNOUNCER] Three!
Goku has picked Number Three!

124
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,291
And the next fighter
to draw is Narig!

125
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,708
Cool.

126
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:27,291
All right, Buu! Let's see!
Give this guy Number Six!

127
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
Six! Yes!

128
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,166
Hey! Hey! Is this guy the one?

129
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:47,291
It's Six! Narig
has picked Number Six!

130
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,416
Now! Uub! You're next!

131
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,666
Yes! Right!

132
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,458
All right, Buu!
Now make this one Number Four!

133
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't care about
the rest of them!

134
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,291
Okay!

135
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:04,541
What? No way! That
can't be him! He's a kid!

136
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,833
[GOKU] He's been waiting
a long time for this!

137
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't be deceived
by his appearance!

138
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,791
He's the one all right!

139
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,625
How could you possibly know
that? I don't understand!

140
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Well, it's strange!

141
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,208
But right before I destroyed
the evil final form of Buu

142
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,791
I made a request!

143
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,500
I asked him to come
back as a good person

144
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,083
so we could fight together!

145
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,333
Apparently, King
Yemma heard my request

146
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,250
and decided to make it happen!

147
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:37,208
Wait? Hold on! You're
saying that this boy is Buu?!

148
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,250
Mm-hmm! I'm almost certain!

149
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,083
And there's a
pretty significant clue!

150
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,291
Just, look at his name!
It's U-U-B!

151
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,541
That's Buu spelled
backwards! Bizarre, huh?

152
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,333
Uub is final form
of Buu reincarnated!

153
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,250
Did you hear that?

154
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,166
Yes! It's crazy!

155
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,125
[UUB thinking] Ooo... I'm afraid
that what Mother said is true!

156
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,750
Even though I'm the strongest
one in my village there may be

157
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,041
some men in this world that
are even stronger than me!

158
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,583
Ohh! These men
look so powerful!

159
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,083
[VEGETA]
Twelve!

160
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,625
[UUB thinking] Oh, Heaven
help me! What am I gonna do?

161
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,875
I promised everyone
that I would win the prize

162
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,791
and come back with lots of food!

163
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,083
I can't go back empty handed!

164
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,500
[UUB thinking]
Goku... Which one is he?

165
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,166
Uh-oh!

166
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,000
The first round
match ups are now final!

167
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:12,750
[ANNOUNCER] In the first bout,
Pan will be facing Wild Tiger!

168
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:17,333
In the second bout,
Goku will take on Uub!

169
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:22,666
In the third bout, Narig
will fight Captain Chicken!

170
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,125
Next, Buu will face
Goten in the fourth bout!

171
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,000
The fifth bout will feature
Trunks and Otokoski!

172
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:36,958
And in the sixth, Vegeta will
go head to head with Knock!

173
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:44,416
[crowd cheers]

174
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,458
Fighters, the judges are gonna
need a few minutes to get ready,

175
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,041
and then we'll call the
names for the first bout!

176
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,125
Until then,
you are free to rest,

177
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,208
warm up, or do as you please
to prepare. Good luck to you!

178
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,541
Great! How come I'm the one

179
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,750
stuck fighting Buu
in the first round?

180
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,958
That's the luck of the draw!

181
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
Well! You'll
be on that date

182
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,958
a little sooner than
you thought, tough guy!

183
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:11,208
[WILD TIGER] Huh! What are
you bozos belly-aching about?

184
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:15,458
I have to fight
a little, bitty kid!

185
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:20,750
The mighty Wild Tiger doing
battle with a toddler? Come on!

186
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,958
Ahh! This is stupid!
They shouldn't even let you in!

187
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,333
This isn't a tournament
for breast-feeding babies!

188
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,208
[OTOKOSKI] Well,
I'm happy with my match-up!

189
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:38,833
Yum! Mmm! I'll be gentle
with you. Don't worry.

190
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,958
Yep! That's the luck
of the draw, Trunks. Hahaha.

191
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,541
[KNOCK] Hey! Old man, looks like
we'll be fighting each other.

192
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,333
Got a little attitude
there. Is that it?

193
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,708
Or are you just so old and ugly
that you can't hear anymore!

194
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,208
Hey! Hahahaha!

195
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,916
Hahahaha!

196
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,833
[VEGETA] Tell the officials my
opponent has decided to forfeit!

197
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,416
Ugh! Couldn't he wait?

198
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,666
Wow! Papa's strong!!

199
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,541
[ANNOUNCER]
And now for the moment

200
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,208
you've all been waiting for,
It's time to begin

201
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,166
the final rounds of the
World Martial Arts Championship!

202
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,833
[ANNOUNCER] Twelve fighters
are still remaining,

203
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,583
but only one of them
will earn the right to fight

204
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,875
for the title of World Champion

205
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,791
and the prize money
that goes with it!

206
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,708
Serving as the sponsor for
our prize money this year

207
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,625
is none other than Mr. Satan,

208
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,125
the reigning World
Champion, himself!

209
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,416
[WILD TIGER]
This just ain't right!

210
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,000
[VIDEL] All right!
It's almost time, sweety!

211
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,333
Let's get this good and tight!

212
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,166
There you go! Now be strong,
but also be careful, okay?

213
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,083
'Kay!

214
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,250
Stay loose, Pan!
Remember your training, okay!

215
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,833
Right!

216
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,458
[ANNOUNCER] Will Pan and Wild
Tiger please report to the ring?

217
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,250
[GOHAN]
You're on, Pan!

218
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,625
[VIDEL]
Go get 'em, sweetie!

219
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,166
[PAN]
Yeah!

220
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,416
Wish me luck!

221
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,125
[PAN] Bye, everybody!
Number one! Number one...

222
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,125
[GOKU]
Bye, Pan! I'll be watching!

223
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,708
[ANNOUNCER] In this first bout,
Wild Tiger is facing Pan,

224
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,666
a talented, young girl
at the tender age of four!

225
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,250
But don't be surprised,

226
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,958
her grandfather is none
other than the one, the only...

227
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,833
You got it! Mr. Satan!

228
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
It's time to go, go, go!

229
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,291
Are you ready
for the big show?

230
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,125
Yeah! Then allow me to
introduce the fighters!

231
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:22,083
First! The enormous
Wild Tiger and Pan!

232
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,000
She's so cute!

233
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,291
You go girl!

234
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,333
Careful there,
big guy! Ha, ha, ha!

235
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,958
[WILD TIGER thinking] So this is
the Champ's granddaughter, huh?

236
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:44,833
So what? It's still
embarrassing as heck! Munchkin!

237
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,458
Look man, I know she's
Hercules's granddaughter,

238
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,541
but how in the world did
she survive the preliminaries?

239
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,375
Uh, I got a feeling like this
could get really, really ugly!

240
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,625
[MR. SATAN] My poor, little Pan!
Please be okay!

241
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,291
Give it your best, Pan!

242
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,125
Pan! Take it easy on him, 'kay?

243
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,791
Go, Pan! You're the best!

244
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,000
Fighters! Let the match begin!

245
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,208
Yeah! All right!
So be it then!

246
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,083
Ohohoho!

247
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,000
Yay!!

248
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,000
[ANNOUNCER] Ah! What an attack!
At least he's still breathing!

249
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:34,541
The winner of the first bout,
by knockout, the mighty Pan!

250
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,083
[BULLA]
Way to go, Pan!

251
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,125
[OX-KING]
That's a girl, Pan!

252
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,833
[ANNOUNCER] And Pan
advances to the second round!

253
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,000
Number one! Number one! Yay!

254
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,833
Pan, you okay?

255
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,958
Uh, huh! Of course I am, Gramps!

256
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,875
[TRUNKS] After all!
She is your granddaughter!

257
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,833
[GOKU] Pan! You little rascal!
What a great performance! Wow!

258
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,291
Thanks!

259
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,750
Hi there, I guess we're
up next! My name's Goku!

260
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,708
Let's do our best!

261
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,916
Yeah sure! I'm looking
forward to it, Goku!

262
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,541
[ANNOUNCER] And now
it's time for the next bout!

263
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,708
Featuring Goku
and the youngster, Uub!

264
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,666
Goku has appeared in numerous
tournaments over the years

265
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,291
and is a former
World Champion himself!

266
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,000
He is a truly
remarkable fighter!

267
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,083
In my opinion,

268
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,458
he is second to none
among the competition here

269
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,708
and if I may make a prediction!

270
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
I think that it
will be Goku and Buu

271
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,791
fighting it out to see
who goes to the Championship!

272
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,333
Goku's opponent comes
from a small village

273
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,791
on a far away island!

274
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,458
He's the oldest
of five children!

275
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,291
His name is Uub and
he entered the tournament

276
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,125
in the hopes of
winning the prize money

277
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,833
so he can use it to buy
food for his village! Aww...

278
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,916
Give that boy a hot dog!

279
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,541
Two hot dogs! He needs
some meat on his bones!

280
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,000
[BULMA] It's a shame that
that nice boy traveled so far

281
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,583
only to get matched up
with Goku in the finals!

282
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,583
This is going to be the
true championship bout!

283
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,541
That's for sure!

284
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,000
[ANNOUNCER]
Fighters! Let the match begin!

285
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,708
Hey, don't be so tense!

286
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,291
You can't fight to your
full potential like that!

287
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah! Right!

288
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,250
He's so nervous!

289
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,416
[GOKU thinking]
He's got it bad!

290
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,291
I hate to do it, but this
calls for drastic measures!

291
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,000
Hey, kid! Your diaper's dirty!
I smell it from here!

292
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,500
Huh?

293
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,708
Oh, and drop the goody-goody
act, you stinky village rat.

294
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,458
And I'm gonna finish
that haircut for ya,

295
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,875
you half-pint
beauty school reject.

296
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,541
And, uhh... Oh, yeah!
You're plain ugly, too!

297
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,583
Yeah that's it!

298
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,083
And that's not surprising

299
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,916
when you consider what the
rest of your family looks like!

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,208
Is it? Ah, Mohawk boy!

301
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,583
[UUB thinking]
M-My family?

302
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,875
[GOKU] Your mother's so fat,
that cows moo at her!

303
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,375
[UUB]
How dare you insult my mother!

304
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,791
Huh?

305
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,166
Well, come on then, kid!

306
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,750
Right here! Right on my Uub!

307
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,500
What's your dad's deal?

308
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,541
I've never seen him
act like this before!

309
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,083
Yeah...

310
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,208
[GOKU thinking]
Now I'll go for the jugular!

311
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,125
Your dad's a bed wetter!

312
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,708
My mom isn't fat!

313
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,541
My family isn't ugly!

314
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:40,166
And my father's
not a bed wetter!

315
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,416
[NARRATOR]
Young Uub has finally snapped!

316
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,916
The dormant power
of the reborn Majin

317
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,208
is erupting in a fury.

318
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:52,208
The second round, which Goku
promised Buu ten years ago,

319
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,291
is about to get underway!
