1
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,791
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,875
As the new guardian
of the Earth,

3
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,166
Dende quickly
created a new Dragon,

4
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,291
and thus brought back
the shining powers

5
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,750
of the Dragon Balls.

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,000
[NARRATOR] As a result,

7
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,125
our heroes could bring back
all the people killed by Cell,

8
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,750
but first, Goku had
to zap around the world

9
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,333
to collect all seven.

10
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,916
[NARRATOR] And after a
troublesome run-in with

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,041
a goofy gangster
and his hired killer,

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,458
the robotically
enhanced General Tao,

13
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,708
Goku's journey
was almost complete.

14
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,041
He'd gathered up six
of the seven Dragon Balls

15
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,375
and was on his
way to find the last.

16
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,041
[VODKA] Yeah, go right ahead.

17
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,958
Hey, alright! I've got
all seven Dragon Balls!

18
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,208
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,125
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
back at Kami's lookout,

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,041
a handful of the other
fighters were spending

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,458
their last few moments
in preparation.

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,666
Trunks continued
to train his body,

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,708
while, much to
Krillin's astonishment,

24
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,166
Gohan and Dende chose
instead to train their minds

25
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,208
with homework!

26
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,833
[ALL laugh]

27
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,500
[NARRATOR] But time
is quickly running out.

28
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,916
Cell has been
waiting days on end

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,708
for his Martial Arts Tournament.

30
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,583
And it begins
in less than one hour!

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,291
Well, I better go...

32
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,750
[BOTH sigh]

33
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,291
Be careful out there, Goku!

34
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,625
Come back safely...

35
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,291
Hey, don't worry.

36
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,625
Promise me Gohan
will not fight!

37
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,625
Ahh... Well...

38
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,333
Goku, you have to promise me
that Gohan won't get involved!

39
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,208
I gotta run...

40
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,666
[CHICHI] Goku, wait!

41
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,416
Oh no... he wouldn't even
promise me. And that means--!

42
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,250
[CHICHI gasps]

43
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,250
D-Dad!

44
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,708
[KRILLIN] Alright!

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,250
Today's the day.

46
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,416
Huh...?

47
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Where's Vegeta?

48
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,333
He went on ahead.

49
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:02,666
I see. He must be pumped up
from all his training.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,916
So, what level's he at?

51
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,291
Hey, guys, what's
with the silent treatment?

52
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,666
Uhh, anybody wanna explain?

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,083
Goku, we seem to have
a bit of a snag here.

54
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,625
It's about the dragon...

55
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,375
See, Dende made it so that
all the people killed by Cell

56
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,541
could be brought
back with one wish.

57
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah...

58
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,041
But unlike on Namek,

59
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,583
this dragon can't restore life
to anyone who's died before...

60
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:47,083
I'm sorry. I should have told
that you before I made it, Goku.

61
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,833
Don't worry,
nothing's gonna happen!

62
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,500
He's not gonna beat us, guys!

63
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,541
[KRILLIN] Hel-lo?!
We're fighting Cell here!

64
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,916
Hey, just take it easy!

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,375
Now, let's hurry up
or we're gonna be late.

66
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,833
[thinking] Ahhh, Goku, the day
of judgment is at last at hand.

67
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,208
Here we are just
twenty minutes away

68
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,958
from the start of
the Cell games!

69
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,416
And by the looks of it,
no one seemed to show up

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,666
to watch for fear
of their lives!

71
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,833
As you can see,
Cell continues to stand

72
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,375
in the middle of the ring
without moving a muscle!

73
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,541
And with not a lot of time
left until the opening bell,

74
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,166
we're still awaiting the arrival
of the people's grand champion!

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,208
The one and only Hercule Satan!

76
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,250
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute...

77
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,833
Yes! Someone's coming!

78
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,500
[brakes screeching]

79
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,875
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen!

80
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,291
Mr. Satan is here!

81
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,708
Yeah!

82
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,000
[ANNOUNCER] So put your hands
together for Mr. Satan!

83
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:24,541
[CROWD cheering]

84
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,958
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan is now
making his way to the ring.

85
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,750
[MR. SATAN] You're going down!

86
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,250
Whoaaa!

87
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,416
Ladies and gentlemen,
the tournament's about to begin!

88
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,500
And Mr. Satan is already
declaring his victory!

89
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,041
But wait, folks,

90
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,791
even with the world's strongest
man about to challenge him,

91
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,666
Cell remains as calm
as a cucumber!

92
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,333
Well then, let's begin.

93
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,791
So, it looks like Cell's anxious
to get the show on the road,

94
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,666
and so are we!

95
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,416
Ladies and Gentleman,
let the Ultimate Games begin!

96
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,041
[ANNOUNCER] The hopes and
dreams of the entire planet

97
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,625
rest on the shoulders
of Hercule Satan,

98
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,541
but between you and me, we don't
have a thing to worry about.

99
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,916
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan is now
making his way toward Cell.

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,875
But the champ appears
to be taking his sweet time!

101
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
And from my
vantage point, folks,

102
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,375
you can cut the
tension with a knife!

103
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,541
[ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute!

104
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:04,791
Huh? Wh-What's he doing?
He wants US to come down there?

105
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,500
[MR. SATAN] Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:12,958
Yes, well... ahh... sure. Huh?

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,916
Okay, we're coming!
Just hang on!

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,083
I don't think I have a choice!

109
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,500
This just might be my last
broadcast, ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,083
but being a true professional,
it's my duty to you

111
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,916
my viewing audience!

112
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,000
[ANNOUNCER] Oh my...

113
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,500
On a personal note,
just in case this is

114
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,000
the last event I ever cover,

115
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,541
I'd like to thank each
and everyone of my loyal viewers

116
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:43,041
for the cards and letters you've
sent to me over my years at ZTV.

117
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,125
[ANNOUNCER chuckles nervously]

118
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,291
So, ah, I suppose
I should thank you

119
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,083
for the ringside
seats, M-Mr. Satan.

120
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,916
C'mon up here, and quickly!

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,291
[ANNOUNCER] Sure,
what ever you say!

122
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,833
So, uh, a-are you ready
for the fight, Mr. Satan?

123
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,708
Any last remarks?

124
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,000
I'd like to give
Cell my condolences.

125
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,083
It's too bad my unworthy
opponent didn't know

126
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,000
that I existed before he
started this tournament of his!

127
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,000
Anything else?

128
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,666
I'll give him one
last chance to back out.

129
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,333
He might think he's a champ,
but he's just a chump!

130
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,541
[CROWD cheers]

131
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,416
Listen up, you bum!

132
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,583
You are going down
in the first round!

133
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,750
I know you beat the
Royal Military

134
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,333
by planting bombs beforehand!

135
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:47,041
I know all your stupid parlor
tricks and I'm not impressed!

136
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,250
I can't believe
he won't respond!

137
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,875
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

138
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,958
He's just upset
I know his weaknesses!

139
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

140
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,208
Hey, Cell, get a
load of this one!

141
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,000
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

142
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,708
[MR. SATAN laughs]

143
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,375
You can kiss my butt!

144
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,583
[MR. SATAN laughs]

145
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:14,375
[CROWD cheers]

146
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,375
[ROSHI] You know, it might
be fair if he gets killed.

147
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,750
Huh...? Ha-ha!

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,833
Hey, look, guys,
it's Yamcha and Tien!

149
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,958
We'll come with you,
but we want you to know

150
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,958
that we're not going to fight.

151
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,958
Sure. Now let's go.

152
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,625
[MR. SATAN raspberries]

153
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,166
[laughing]

154
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,750
You're a little thick,
aren't you there?!

155
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,833
[MR. SATAN laughs]

156
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,791
Sucker!

157
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,333
[laughing continues]

158
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,875
And another verbal jab! The
fight hasn't even started yet!

159
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,916
And in this announcer's
humble opinion,

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,916
it seems Mr. Satan
is already winning!

161
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,916
[ANNOUNCER] Huh?

162
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,458
[ANNOUNCER] What the...?

163
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,041
What is that?

164
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,208
What are you talking about?

165
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,791
[ANNOUNCER] What do you
think it could be?

166
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,375
[thinking] Ahh... Vegeta...

167
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,166
I thought you would
have learned by now.

168
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,875
I hope for his sake
he's powerd up.

169
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,583
[ANNOUNCER] It appears that
we have another visitor,

170
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,416
but I don't recognize him.

171
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,750
He just came flying
in here unexpectedly.

172
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,416
One of Cell's tricks!

173
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,666
I'm not sure what
he's doing here,

174
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,458
so why don't we
go up and ask him?

175
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,375
So, who are you and
what are you doing here?

176
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,250
And if you've
just come to watch,

177
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,375
back away from the ring
before you get hurt!

178
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,000
Quiet! I've had enough
of your insolence!

179
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,708
--Huh?!
--Get out of my face!

180
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,833
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

181
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,791
If you ask me,
that guy's totally nuts!

182
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,458
Have any thoughts, champ?

183
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:37,125
Ahhhhhh... He's probably
just one of my fanatical fans.

184
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,791
[ANNOUNCER growls]

185
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,500
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

186
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,041
according to my watch,

187
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,750
we're just five minutes away
from the start of the Cell Games

188
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,041
that will decide
the fate of the Earth!

189
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,375
As I predicted, Mr. Satan
is the only challenger

190
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,333
to step forward
to take on Cell!

191
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,583
But then again, what
more do we really need

192
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,500
when we have the World Champion
of Martial Arts on our side!

193
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,333
Coming up, it's the
fight of the century!

194
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,666
Huh?

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,375
Hm?!

196
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,000
Wh... Where are
they all coming from?

197
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,083
Ahh... it's another
one of those tricks!

198
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:35,166
Well, what a surprise...
Android 16.

199
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,208
You're still alive and kicking,

200
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,375
and with beautiful
repairs, no less!

201
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
[thinking] Bulma and her
father made that android

202
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,583
just as powerful as before!

203
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,458
What idiots! Why
did they even bother?

204
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,625
Cell just said something
to the red-haired guy!

205
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,625
Do you think that those
two know each other?

206
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,208
Who cares?!

207
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,416
You can tell by
his outfit he's a nobody!

208
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,875
Hmm?

209
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,500
[CELL chuckles]

210
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:13,625
Ah, there you are, Goku.
And just in time!

211
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,875
I can hardly wait...

212
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,125
Keep. It. Rolling...

213
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,583
[MR. SATAN] Wha...?!

214
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,000
Goku, down there!

215
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
Let's do it.

216
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,208
[CROWD gasping,
murmuring]

217
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,958
W-Who are those guys?

218
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,416
They're gonna get in
Mr. Satan's way!

219
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,541
[CHICHI] Gohan,
my darling, nooo!

220
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,083
My precious, little baby!
Get out of there!

221
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,083
Please, you've
got to get out of there!

222
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,625
[OX-KING] ChiChi, calm down!

223
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,791
There's nothing you
can do for him now!

224
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,500
[CHICHI] You've got to help
me get him out of there!

225
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,916
Please, before my
little pumpkin gets hurt!

226
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,041
My precious, little Gohan,
listen to your mommy and run!

227
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,083
Welcome, welcome, everyone!

228
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,083
[thinking] Why did they
have to come?!

229
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,958
But how... how is it physically
possible for all of them to fly?

230
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,583
I-I guess that trick's
very... popular today!

231
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,125
Huh...? Huh?!

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,541
Android 16! Hey, you're back!

233
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,666
Yes, and thank you.
Because of your help,

234
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,791
I am at last fully
functional again.

[KRILLIN chuckles]

Aw, shucks. You're welcome.

My name's Goku.

238
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,375
I know your name.

239
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:13,291
I was created solely to destroy
you. Though I've chosen not to.

240
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,416
Get a load of Mr. Personality...

241
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,458
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

242
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm not sure what to
make of all these newcomers!

243
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,708
I must say it's
verrry intriguing!

244
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,208
Hey, don't forget about me.

245
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:38,583
Excuse me, have
the games started?

246
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,958
Not yet, but almost...

247
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,083
Okay then!

248
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,666
[bones popping]

249
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,083
Let's get this thing going.
And if you want, I'll be first!

250
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,291
Goku, you don't have to
be the first one to fight!

251
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,875
What d'ya say, Vegeta?

00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
Be my guest.

253

We all know it will be me
who ends up finishing off Cell.

[MR. SATAN stammers]

255

Hey, don't you know
I'm the Champ around here?!

256

Ah, excuse me, sir,

257
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,500
but I was just wondering
if you or your friends

258
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,625
were going to take
part in the tournament?

Of course, I'll be going first.

[MR. SATAN growls]

I've had about enough of you
clowns and your stupid jokes!

Now clear outta here
before I get angry!

I'm sorry, I forgot.

You ignorant hicks have
spent your whole lives playing

268
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,000

so you don't realize that I,

Hercule Satan, am the MARTIAL
ARTS CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!

And the other challengers have
been left totally speechless,

by the one and only...

OF THE... whuh?

know who I am, I'll show you.

[growling]

00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,416
Now who rules?

279
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,208
Champion of all Martial Arts
in the World, Mr. Satan!

Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!
Mr.-- Uh?!

They... They aren't
buying it at all.

I say... we let the
Neanderthal nerd ball go first.

283
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,541
You... think we should?

284
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,750
It's time!

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
[NARRATOR] The buzzer
has sounded,

286
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,708
and the time for waiting
has come to a close!

287
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
But who will be victorious?

288
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:09,166
Will it be our hero,
the strangely confident Goku?

289
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,291
Or has Vegeta finally
become the strongest of all?

290
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,166
There's always Piccolo now
that he's reuinited with Kami.

291
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,125
[NARRATOR] Will Yamcha
and Tien decide to fight?

292
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,000
Or could Trunks fulfill his
goal to save the future?

293
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,166
Don't forget Gohan and Krillin.

294
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,583
The biggest battle ever in the
history of Dragon Ball Z

295
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,166
is about to begin,

296
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,250
so don't miss the
next exciting episode.

297
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,791
Non-stop action is guaranteed.

298
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:44,000
And yet, the question remains:
Will our heroes come out on top

299
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,125
and destroy the mighty Cell?

300
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,958
Or will it be the end of the
Earth as we know it?

301
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:54,291
The pressure is on Goku and the
Z Fighters to save mankind.
