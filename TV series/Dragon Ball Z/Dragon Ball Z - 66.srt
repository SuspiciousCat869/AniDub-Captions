1
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,416
Now Dragon Balls,
grant me my wish!

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,875
[NARRATOR] With all seven
Dragon Balls in his possession,

4
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,958
Frieza's victory
seemed certain!

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,000
However, making a
wish proved to be

6
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,958
more difficult
than expected...

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,791
Maybe it already
came true.

8
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,458
No! There must be some secret
to unlocking their power!

9
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,541
[NARRATOR] As Frieza
raced off in search

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,875
of the information he needed,

11
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,708
elsewhere, Gohan was
fighting for his life

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,541
and the lives of his friends
against the sinister Recoome!

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,958
[GOHAN] No...
It's not over... Yet...

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,458
I'm not gonna
let you win!

15
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,708
Now... Here's your doom!

16
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,333
[BOTH grunt]

17
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,375
[NARRATOR] But despite
his most valiant efforts,

18
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,208
the young warrior proved no
match for the towering Recoome.

19
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,208
[NARRATOR] With Gohan
down for the count,

20
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,708
it looked like our heroes'
chances for survival

21
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,250
had finally run out...
When suddenly...

22
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,458
[NARRATOR] A lone spaceship
appeared in the skies,

23
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,291
and came rocketing down
to the planet's surface!

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,041
But if the new arrival wasn't
one of Frieza's henchmen,

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,750
who else
could it be?

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,791
Maybe some Nameks?

27
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,416
Poor dopes! They
shoulda stayed gone...

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
[NARRATOR] No...
This was no Namek...

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,541
The Ginyu Force
will have to contend

30
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,750
with the might
of Goku! Today!

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:44,958
[KING KAI] Huh?!

32
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,166
Hm?

33
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,958
[KING KAI] He made it!
Goku's there!

34
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,083
The others are still in
trouble, but if he hurries,

35
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,083
there may be hope
for them yet!

36
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,625
It's a slim
hope, granted.

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,958
But if there's anyone who
can save them, it's Goku!

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,416
Yes...

39
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,916
[COMPUTER] Attention.
Landing complete.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,291
Welcome to
Planet Namek.

41
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,708
Passengers are now free
to move about the cabin.

42
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,833
Please watch your step
as you exit the craft,

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,750
and as always, thank you
for flying Capsule Corp.

44
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,500
What the...? Who
the heck is that?

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,041
It's Goku! I knew it...
I knew he'd make it!

47
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,000
[thinking] Wow...

48
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm sensing some really
big powers out there.

49
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,916
Evil powers...

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,833
Hang on, guys...
Gohan, Krillin, Bulma...

51
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:24,708
[thinking] Hmm... Over there.
That's the biggest one...

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,875
[thinking] And there's number
two, the second strongest!

53
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,791
But what about
Gohan and Krillin?

54
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,041
Why can't I sense
where they are?

55
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,750
Huh? That's why!
They're barely alive!

56
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,000
Their power...
It's almost down to zero!

57
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,625
I had no idea that I
was cutting it so close!

58
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,708
There's not another
minute to spare!

59
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,500
[GOKU growls]

60
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,125
All right then...
This is it!

61
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
It's finally time
to see if all that

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,958
100-times gravity
training paid off!

63
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,833
[BOTH gasp]

64
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,333
[JEICE] I don't like
the way this feels!

65
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,166
What the
heck is it?!

66
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,291
[RECOOME yells]

67
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,625
[RECOOME yelling]

68
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,500
[RECOOME gasps]

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,416
Gohan...

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,791
Hah... Kakarot. Of course...

71
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,250
So he finally
decided to show up...

72
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,291
[KRILLIN chuckles]

73
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,625
[KRILLIN] Goku!

74
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,750
[GOKU] Hey, Krillin!
I brought you a surprise!

75
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,375
Hold on! I'll
be right there!

76
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,750
It's okay, son.
I'm here now...

77
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,166
Gohan?
Hey, son?

78
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,791
Oh, wow... You're
in really bad shape.

79
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,916
But, we can fix that...
You hear me, son?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,666
You're going to be fine,
Gohan, don't you worry!

81
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,583
Hmph! He-Hey! Who the hell
do you think you are?!

82
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,208
You can't just
barge in here!

83
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
[GOKU] Try to
swallow this, Gohan.

84
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,833
[RECOOME] Hey! Hello?!
I'm talkin' to you!

85
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,708
This guy's pretty
good, Burter!

86
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,625
That's quite an
entrance he made...

87
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,875
He's really fast!
Maybe even faster than you!

88
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,625
Yeah, right!
Give me a break!

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,375
See, low fighting power!
He's all show!

90
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,750
You're too easily
impressed, Jeice!

91
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,125
[GOHAN gasps]

92
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,916
Hey! How do
you feel?!

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,541
Daddy? Oh! Dad!
Is it really you?

94
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,208
[RECOOME gasps]

95
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,166
Hey... I thought you said
that kid's neck was broken!

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,750
Yeah, well...
It was!

97
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,125
[GOKU] Your mom'd kill me if
she saw how dirty you are.

98
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,166
[GOHAN] Dad! Those guys
are super-powerful!

99
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,875
[GOKU] I know. We definitely
have our work cut out for us.

100
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,250
But I'm here now. Just leave
everything to me, okay?

101
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,125
Yeah... sure...

102
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,625
[GOKU] So, you were taking on
that big guy over there, huh?

103
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,250
[GOHAN] Well, I tried.
But he was too strong for me.

104
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,250
[VEGETA growls]

105
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,166
Vegeta looks like he's
in pretty bad shape, too.

106
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,666
What happened
to him?

107
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,291
The big guy... Vegeta tried
to fight him before I did...

108
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,916
So did Krillin. But they
couldn't beat him either.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,875
[GOKU] Really? Sounds like
this guy's a real handful...

110
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,958
Yeah...
I'll say...

111
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,375
[GOKU laughs]

112
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,833
Don't worry... I've got
just what the doctor ordered!

113
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,333
See? A Senzu Bean!

114
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,250
[KRILLIN chuckles]

115
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm so glad
you came...

116
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,000
But I almost
wish you hadn't...

117
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
Why, what's
the matter?

118
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,291
[KRILLIN] Those Ginyu guys.
They're just too powerful...

119
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,625
Whaaa?!

120
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,458
It's like he just touches
them and their healed!

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,875
Yeah... It's crazy!
Who is this guy?

122
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,333
Curse you...
Kakarot...

123
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,000
[KRILLIN] I'm not
trying to be negative...

124
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,000
It's just, well, I think
we're a little outclassed!

125
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,791
I know you're
really strong...

126
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
But, man!
I'm telling you!

127
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,833
We've never dealt with
anything like this!

128
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,708
These guys
are too much!

129
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,333
That's why I say I wish
you hadn't come, Goku...

130
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
Now they're just
gonna get you, too!

131
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,541
I mean, Vegeta couldn't
even stop 'em,

132
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,833
and he's
stonger than ever!

133
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,916
Yeah, about Vegeta...

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,333
Uhhh...

135
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,666
What was Vegeta doing fighting
them in the first place?

136
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,625
I thought he was
on their side...

137
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,708
I don't know
where to begin!

138
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,041
It's been
crazy here!

139
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,500
[GOKU] Don't speak.
This'll be a lot faster.

140
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,375
Just relax...

141
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,375
[KRILLIN] Oh,
well... Alright.

142
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,416
[GOHAN] Wh-what
are you doing, Dad?

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
[GOKU] I'm going to
read Krillin's mind...

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,250
Thanks...

145
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
I understand
everything...

146
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,041
How?

147
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,375
I'm not really sure!
That was my first time!

148
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,250
It's weird! I finished
my training program

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,958
on the ship and
something happened...

150
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,208
I didn't think it was any
big deal at the time,

151
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,625
but I guess exercising at
one-hundred times normal gravity

152
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,333
has its benefits!

153
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,708
What?! A hundred times?!

154
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,875
How is that possible?
You'd be crushed!

155
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,125
Nah. I guess I must have
tough skin or something...

156
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583

he had no equal
in the universe!

But he was too
primitive to control it!

so intensely

that it eventually
consumed him.

destroyed by his own power!

So there he is! Wow!

313
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,125
[thinking] Vegeta spotted
him before the rest of us.

314
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,500
He knew where Goku
was the whole time...

315
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,125
Man, I don't wanna know how
powerful that guy's getting...

316
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,583
You guys have caused
enough problems here.

317
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,916
It's time for
you to leave.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,208
[BOTH growl]

319
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,041
Go back to your ships
and get off this planet.

320
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Otherwise
you'll face me.

321
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:23,041
[BURTER &amp; JEICE yelling]

322
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,125
Who... is this guy?!

323
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,541
[RECOOME] Ooh, you
cocky little punk.

324
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
That's enough
showin' off.

325
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,750
We get the idea.
You're pretty quick.

326
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,875
Heh...

327
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,541
Yeah...
Except speed alone

328
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,000
isn't gonna be
enough to save you.

329
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,708
[RECOOME] See, I've got
this special little move

330
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,375
I like to use...

331
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:58,333
And trust me, you won't be able
to dodge this one. No, sir.

332
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,541
I'm gonna wipe out
this whole place!

333
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,708
Everything you see
is gonna be rubble!

334
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,375
Just one shot, and
you're all dead!

335
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,083
[thinking] Kakarot... Now we'll
see if I'm right about you!

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,375
[RECOOME] I hope you're
ready, Chief...

337
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,583
'Cause I'm about to send
all you little wimps

338
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,916
straight to hell!

339
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,958
[RECOOME growling]

340
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,750
[RECOOME laughs]

341
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,791
Dodge this, punk!

342
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,625
[RECOOME growling]

343
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,500
[KRILLIN] W-whoa! Look out!

344
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,958
Here it comes!

345
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,208
[RECOOME growls]

346
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Now, full power!

347
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
Eraser Gun!

348
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,125
[RECOOME grunts]

349
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,583
[VEGETA gasps]

350
00:20:53,958 --> 00:21:03,500
[RECOOME sputtering]

351
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,625
Sorry! I saw an opening
that seemed to scream out:

352
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,458
Attack!
So... I did.

353
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,166
[GOKU laughs]

354
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,208
[RECOOME grunting]

355
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,916
[GOHAN] I-Is that it?
Did Dad win?

356
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,583
Yeah... One punch!
That's crazy!

357
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,750
I just don't see
how it's possible!

358
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,083
It's like we're
in a dream!

359
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,416
The Goku we
left on Earth

360
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,166
couldn't be doing
this right now!

361
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,916
[thinking] But this isn't
the Goku we left on Earth...

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,791
Why is Recoome
still down?

363
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,583
Looks like he
barely touched him!

364
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,708
That attack didn't even
register on the scouters!

365
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,125
Damn! Kakarot...

366
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,916
The others may not have seen
the power behind that attack...

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,750
But you do not
deceive my eyes!

368
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,791
[VEGETA thinking]
With that one blow,

369
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,583
Kakarot has proved
himself stronger

370
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,541
than any Saiyan I
have ever known...

371
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,125
Perhaps any Saiyan
in a thousand years!

372
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,625
And I, the Prince
of all Saiyans,

373
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,958
have somehow become
this pauper's witness!

374
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm the only one who
understands what he's become.

375
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,250
Even better than he
understands it himself!

376
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,291
Kakarot has become
a Super Saiyan!

377
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,583
[NARRATOR] What is this
Super Saiyan,

378
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,958
that even the mighty
Vegeta fears it?

379
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,291
And has Goku truly achieved
this legendary status?

380
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,333
Don't miss the
next Dragon Ball Z!
