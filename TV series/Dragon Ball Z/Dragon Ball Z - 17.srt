1
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,416
With the deadly Saiyan
duo on the horizon,

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,958
Earth's heroes
had no choice

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,833
but to put their training
plans into overdrive...

5
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,208
Goku continued his search
for King Kai along Snake Way

6
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,416
while Tien and the others made
their way up Korin's Tower

7
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,750
for a little one-on-one
with the mythical master...

8
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,625
All the time Gohan
had spent alone

9
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,916
got the better of him,
and he was so homesick

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,291
that he felt the need
for a family reunion...

11
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,250
But it was
not to be.

12
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,083
Common sense took over
and he realized

13
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,916
that he must complete his
training and put the brakes on

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,041
the incoming Saiyan
invasion first.

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,250
Without his mom or
dad to support him,

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,208
all the non-stop training has
been tough on the little guy...

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,083
Luckily, Piccolo showed up and
took him under his wing.

18
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,416
Now, Gohan will learn what it
takes to be a real warrior...

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,125
But will it be enough
to stop the Saiyans?

20
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:27,291
[wind blows]

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,083
Hm. Now, are you
ready, Gohan?

22
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,666
Do you think you
have what it takes

23
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,666
to move on to the next
level of training?

24
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,500
Good! With an attitude like
that, you just might make it.

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,750
Go! Give me
everything you've got!

26
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,333
Haah!

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:51,916
[fighting noises]

28
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,916
[PICCOLO] Try again!

29
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,291
Keep your eye
on the enemy!

30
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,625
But you disappeared,
I couldn't see you.

31
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,916
If you can't see the
enemy, feel him out!

32
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,041
That's a lot easier
said than done.

33
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,583
[GOHAN whimpering]

34
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,000
Hah!

35
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,625
[GOHAN squealing]

36
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,750
Next time you find
time to whine,

37
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,583
think about what you should
do instead... and do it!

38
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,666
[GOHAN grunting]

39
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,333
[PICCOLO] We only have
three months

40
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
until the Saiyans
arrive, Gohan.

41
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,458
From now on, if you're
not eating or sleeping

42
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,958
then you're sparring
with me! Got it?

43
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,166
That's a little
severe, huh?

44
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,958
The Saiyans
are severe!

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,458
But as strong
as they are,

46
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,583
you're going to have
to be a lot stronger!

47
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,750
There's no room for
doubt in this venture!

48
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,958
Raagh!

49
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,416
[GOHAN screaming]

50
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,041
[PICCOLO] That's it!
Your turn!

51
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,791
[GOKU panting]

52
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,291
[GOKU] This is crazy! There's
just no end to this thing!

53
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
But I've got
to keep going!

54
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,416
Raah!

55
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,625
Hah!

56
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
Kami will see
all of you now.

57
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,333
[KRILLIN] Hey, Kami!
I don't mean to be rude,

58
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,541
but we're not really
learning anything new!

59
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,250
Hmm...

60
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,250
He's right...

61
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,000
So far you haven't
taught us anything

62
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,416
we couldn't
do on our own.

63
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,916
We want to be as strong as
Goku was when he was here!

64
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,750
Yeah! Come on!

65
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,583
We want the same training
you gave Goku, Kami!

66
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,958
Please listen
carefully, then.

67
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,666
Ah!

68
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,750
I taught...

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,958
Goku...

70
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,875
Nothing! That's
what I taught him!

71
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,333
[ALL] Waah!

72
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,625
[KAMI laughing]

73
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,750
Hey! What did he
mean by that?!

74
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,791
Who knows? If this
camp wasn't free,

75
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,375
I'd be out
of here!

76
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,791
Just between you and me,
the food's not that great.

77
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,833
Mr. Popo,
we all know Goku

78
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,250
received training
here before!

79
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Why can't you tell
us what it was?

80
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,291
C'mon! We're just trying
to get stronger, that's all!

81
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,208
To be truly strong,

82
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,958
you must know your
self and your enemy...

83
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,500
Once you know this,
all will become clear.

84
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,416
What do you mean?
Know myself?

85
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,291
Don't give us that rubbish! How
could we not know ourselves!

86
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,833
I know myself better
than anybody.

87
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:52,458
Oh, is that a fact?
So you know yourself, do you?

88
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,416
How come you don't know
that you are weak?

89
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,250
Oh! Would you like to prove
that? You beachball!

90
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,583
[MR. POPO] Mm-mm-mm...

91
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,208
All of you follow me.

92
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,416
Huh?

93
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,333
[KRILLIN]
Wow!

94
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,916
[YAMCHA]
Whoa, check it out!

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,833
[TIEN]
What is this place?

96
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,458
[MR. POPO] Here, past,
present, and future are mixed.

97
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,875
[CHIAOTZU]
Amazing!

98
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,333
[MR. POPO] This is where
you'll start your time trip...

99
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,583
When Goku was with us,

100
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,916
most of his training
took place in this room.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,875
Yeah? Goku?

102
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,916
That's right.
I hope you're ready.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,291
I think we are!
Let's do it!

104
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,750
Yeah!

105
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,666
Hey guys,
have fun!

106
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,291
I'm a lot of
different things,

107
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,750
but I ain't no
guinea pig.

108
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,291
[MR. POPO] Those of
you who wish to go,

109
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,666
step inside the
circle, please.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,791
[MR. POPO] Gentlemen,
I can only recommend

111
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,500
that you see with
your hearts...

112
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,875
Now, close your
eyes, please.

113
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,000
The next time you
open your eyes,

114
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:01,083
you will be in a far off place
exactly one hundred years ago.

115
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,291
I wish you luck,
gentlemen.

116
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,375
[CHIAOTZU]
Where are we?

117
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,458
[YAMCHA]
I don't know,

118
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,708
but there's been some
serious fighting

119
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,750
going on
around here!

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,250
[KRILLIN] This place
is demolished!

121
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,666
[TIEN] Sounds like all of
the fun is over, though. Listen.

122
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,458
[whimpering]

123
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,958
[YAMCHA] Look! It's a Saiyan!

124
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,208
Not anymore!

125
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,416
Listen! I think
I hear something!

126
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,458
[whooshing noise]

127
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,791
[TIEN] There!

128
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,375
[YAMCHA] That could've
been anything.

129
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,416
[KRILLIN] Yeah, but it was
definitely something!

130
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,791
[YAMCHA] C'mon, let's go
check this place out!

131
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,791
Man, what a battle
this must have been.

132
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,666
Look at all
these Saiyans.

133
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,333
Too bad we missed
all the action.

134
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,708
[TIEN] Mr. Popo must have
been off on his calculations.

135
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,041
It's over.

136
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,250
[YAMCHA] There's bound to
be a few Saiyans left,

137
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,458
we'll just look around
until we find them.

138
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,916
[TIEN] Agreed.

139
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,708
I think we'd better
stay together

140
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:23,416
in case we run into any trouble
out here. And stay sharp!

141
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,083
You don't have to
worry about me...

142
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:30,000
I could take on a Saiyan with
my hands tied behind my back!

143
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,583
[KRILLIN] Yeah,
me too! I hope...

144
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,333
[SAIYAN 1] Their total
fighting power

145
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,791
is only fifteen
hundred and ten!

146
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,333
[SAIYAN 2] And they want to
fight some Saiyans, huh?

147
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,750
The fools!

148
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,666
[SAIYAN 1] Let's go
have some fun!

149
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,125
[TIEN] We might
as well go back,

150
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,416
I don't think we're going
to find any action here!

151
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,750
[KRILLIN]
But how do we get back?

152
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,791
[TIEN] Good point.
Mr. Popo didn't tell us that.

153
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,250
Hey, maybe they're too scared
to come out and fight us!

154
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
I don't think so.

155
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,916
And if you met the Saiyan
Goku and Piccolo fought,

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,916
you wouldn't
think so either.

157
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,125
Huh?!

158

[YAMCHA] I don't think so,
they're just super strong!

209
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,666
And if we
don't watch it,

210
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,000
the other one's gonna get
us while we're not looking!

never have come here!

No one comes
to Vegeta!

He's right! We try to
discourage tourism here!

was horrible!

You never left here!

You've all just been standing
around like bunch of zombies!

[MR. POPO] Only your physical
bodies remained here.

266
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,916
With the help of this room,
your spirits made dream bodies

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,583
which they used to travel
to the dream-like past.

So, you guys!
How did it go?

Speak up!

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,541
Well, how did
you guys do?

271
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,791
[KAMI] They did very
well, Yajirobe.

272
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,625
They all faught valiantly
against a very strong enemy.

273
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,541
I should mention to you
all that the Saiyans

274
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,458
on the way to Earth
are twice as strong

275
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,416
as the ones
you just fought!

276
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,583
[YAMCHA] Twice as strong?
Are you sure about that, Kami?!

277
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,833
Mm-hmm.

278
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,791
[KAMI] I can
certainly understand

279
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,291
if any of you want to
back out of this deal.

280
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,875
Believe me, there would be
no dishonor in doing so.

281
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,166
But if you must
leave, go now,

282
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,708
because there will
be no looking back

283
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,375
for those of you who
remain after today.

No, me neither!

287

I'm in!

Me too!

289
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,458
It's settled then!

290
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,458
We'll spend 24 hours a day
in this room if we have to!

291
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,375
We'll beat
those Saiyans!

292
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
Yeah!

293
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,000

[PICCOLO] "Piccolo" nothing!
You're getting lazy!

302
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,250
You can defend yourself
better than that!

303
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,041
Now, show me
what you can do!

304

[GOKU panting]

305
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,916
[NARRATOR] The race
against time is on...

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,708
Now that Tien and the
others have had a taste

307
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,166
of what they'll be up against
when the two Saiyans arrive,

308
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,041
they know they have
a lot more work to do

309
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,875
before they'll be
in fighting shape...

310
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,958
Goku still needs
to find King Kai

311
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,208
in order to complete his own
martial arts training...

312
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,541
And Gohan is being put through
his paces by Piccolo...

313
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,166
Will it all be enough to
stop the Saiyan invasion?

314
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,000
Or will the Z
warriors find out

315
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,666
that they are up against
an unstoppable force?

316
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,375
To find out,
