00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,833
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,583
After returning
from Other World,

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,583
Goku raced away from the
Lookout, on the Flying Nimbus,

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,291
to join his friends
on the battlefield.

5
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,458
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Piccolo,
Gohan, and Krillin

6
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,833
put their training and
skills to the test

7
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,500
as they fought desperately
against Nappa and Vegeta,

8
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,375
two Saiyans bent on
conquering the Earth...

9
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,625
But their combined strength was
no match for the evil pair.

10
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,458
[GOHAN]
Piccolo, we need you!

11
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,541
[NAPPA laughs]

12
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,791
[GOHAN whimpers]

13
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,416
[NARRATOR] While the
others watched in vain

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,666
for news of the battle,

15
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,375
the Saiyans continued
their ruthless conquest,

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:59,041
as Nappa unleashed the full
force of his rage on Gohan.

17
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,083
You...

18
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:08,333
I'll kill you! Ahh!

19
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,666
[GOHAN whimpers]

20
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,958
[NARRATOR] Is this
the end for Gohan?

21
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,541
Find out next
on Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,833
[NAPPA yelling]

23
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,000

[PICCOLO growling]

27
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,958
[NAPPA yelling]

28
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,833
Hurgh!

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,250
[PICCOLO shouting]

30
00:03:55,166 --> 00:04:00,500

00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,458
[GOHAN whimpering]

34
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,000
Huhn?!

35
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:26,958
[PICCOLO panting]

36
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,208
P-Piccolo?

37
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,750
It's okay, kid.
No sweat! Heh, heh, ha...

38
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,458
[GOHAN whimpering]

39
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,666
[GOHAN] No! You can't be hurt,
Piccolo, you just can't!

40
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,625
We need you!

41
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,708
I'm... I'm not
gonna make it...

42
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,250
It's up to you...

43
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,291
[PICCOLO]
You must stop them!

44
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,291
[GOHAN] Piccolo! Hold on
just a little longer!

45
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:03,041
My Dad's coming! He'll
save us! Just hold on!

46
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,833
Aww, too bad. I wanted to
take my time with the Namek!

47
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,750
Oh well, I can still
have fun with the kid...

48
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,250
[thinking]
Something's not right...

49
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,708
One of the big power
levels is fading fast...

50
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:28,041
They're in trouble!
Hang on, Gohan! I'm coming!

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:45,583
[KAMI grunting]

52
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,916
Kami! What is it?

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,791
[KAMI] Piccolo's life force
is fading away,

54
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,416
and mine along
with it.

55
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Goku must not have
gotten there in time.

56
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,208
When we cease
to exist,

57
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,208
so will the Dragon
Balls of this world.

58
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
But, legend tells
of others on Namek.

59
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,625
Find them! Use them
to wish us back!

60
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,625
[MR. POPO]
Wait! Kami! Please!

61
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,833
Don't leave me!

62
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,000
[PICCOLO]
It's ironic, isn't it?

63
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,416
After all my years of
training to defeat your father,

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,083
I'd go out like this...
Trying to save you, his son.

65
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
Piccolo?

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,625
Gohan... You're the
only real friend

67
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,500
that I've ever had.
I want to thank you...

68
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,208
[GOHAN] Just hold
on a little longer!

69
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,666
[PICCOLO] I still remember the
first day I brought you here.

70
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,041
You were small,
helpless...

71
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,458
You've changed
so much since then.

72
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,666
[PICCOLO] The harder things got,
the more determined you became.

73
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,541
The more dangers
you faced,

74
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,041
the stronger you
grew as a warrior...

75
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,666
[PICCOLO] I know
I was hard on you,

76
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,958
but it was for
your own good...

77
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:11,500
You're like the son I never
had. I'm proud of you...

78
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,708
[GOHAN] No! Please!

79
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,416
Good-bye, my friend...

80
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,958
Noo!

81
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,916
Goodbye, Popo!
Remember...

82
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,583
[MR. POPO] Kami!
Kaammii!

83
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,708
[KRILLIN]
Gohan...

84
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,833
[GOHAN screaming]

85
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,291
Huh?!

86
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,375
Huh?! Alright!
Let's go!

87
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,875
Masenko!

88
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,333
Huh?!

89
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,291
Gohan?

90
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,458
[GOHAN grunting]

91
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,708
[VEGETA] That runt's power
level is over two thousand!

92
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,458
Hold on...

93
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,625
It's over three thousand!

94
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
Nappa, watch out!

95
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,833
This one is much more
powerful than he appears!

96
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,083
Here I come, boy!

97
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,041
Haa!

98
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,583
Raagh!

99
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,000
[NAPPA panting]

100
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,583
[GOHAN whimpering]

101
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,916
Oh man!

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,416
Hey, not too bad, kid...
That made my arm numb!

103
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,125
[NAPPA laughing]

104
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,250
Alright, then...
It's my turn!

105
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,125
Ah, that one shot must have
drained all of his energy.

106
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:48,583
His power level has
returned to normal...

107
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,291
They're... too strong!
We just can't stop them!

108
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,875
[KRILLIN growling]

109
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,416
[CHICHI] Let go of me!

110
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,125
[OX KING] I can't let you go,
ChiChi! It's too dangerous!

111
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,458
[CHICHI] I've got
to help them!

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,333
[OOLONG] I've got her!

113
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,333
[CHICHI]
Gohan needs me!

114
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,500
[ROSHI] Hold on, Oolong!
I'm coming!

115
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,333
[BULMA]
Somebody stop her!

116
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,625
Nice to see
you, too!

117
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,125
[ALL] It's Baba!

118
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,375
[BABA] I've come to tell
you that Goku has returned

119
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,791
and will soon join
the others in battle!

120
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,375
You mean...
He's really back?

121
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,375
[thinking] Goku...
Thank goodness.

122
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,833
I know! Let's see how
things are going out there

123
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,208
by looking into
Baba's crystal ball!

124
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,000
You swine! This
isn't a television!

125
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,083
My crystal
ball is sacred!

126
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,541
[CHICHI] Grab it!

127
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,416
[BULMA] Come on,
Oolong, hurry!

128
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,583
Don't worry, Piccolo... 
I won't let you down!

129
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,125
[NAPPA chuckling]

130
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,458
Gohan! Run away! Hurry!

131
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,625
Ha ha! That's right,
run away and hide!

132
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,958
No way...
Piccolo's counting on me.

133
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,291
[NAPPA laughing]

134
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,541
Gohan! No!

135
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,458
Nice knowin' ya, kid!

136
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,458
There'll always be a
soft spot at the bottom

137
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,125
of my boot for ya!

138
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,583
Ha ha, so long!

139
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,625
Huh?!

140
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,416
Rrgh!

141
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,583
Hnn. Huh? Huh?!

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,250
Huh?! Hrghh...

143
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,666
[NAPPA] Hey! Where did
that thing come from?

144
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,666
Huh? Nimbus?

145
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,541
How did he...?
What the..?

146
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,958
Hnn?!

147
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,458
[NAPPA] What is that thing?
What's going on?

148
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,625
Huh?!

149
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,041
Aah! Daddy!

150
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,041
It's... Goku!

151
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,666
Welcome, Kakarot.
Nice of you to join us!

152
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:47,291
[VEGETA laughing]

153
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,875
[VEGETA] Well, I was
beginning to think

154
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,375
you weren't
going to show up,

155
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,666
especially after your little
family reunion with Raditz.

156
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,916
Did you two have
fun catching up?

157
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,916
Goku...
You're here!

158
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,875
My Dad's back!

159
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,750
I see... Not much for
words, eh, Kakarot?

160
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,250
Well, you're
just in time!

161
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,083
We were getting
tired of beating on

162
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,916
these so-called fighters over
and over again. What a joke!

163
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,958
Piccolo...

164
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,416
[GOHAN] He was protecting me...
He saved me!

165
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,833
[GOKU] Tien...

166
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,041
Yamcha...

167
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,583
[NAPPA laughing]

168
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,041
Oh, were these guys friends
of yours? Sorry about that...

169
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,083
They were fun to
fight for a while,

170
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,250
but they all met the
same fate in the end...

171
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,708
[NAPPA laughing]

172
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,416
Yeah, that's right...
I took care of them all!

173
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,250
Well... except for
that little guy.

174
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,625
He decided to
blow himself up.

175
00:13:52,708 --> 00:14:00,000
[GOKU growling]

176
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,458
And the whole time I
was pounding them,

177
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,000
they were waiting
for you to show up!

178
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,458
Somehow they knew you were
coming, but it didn't matter.

179
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,958
You were too late!

180
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,791
[NAPPA laughing]

181
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,625
[VEGETA] Hmm...

182
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,583
Kakarot's power level
is increasing!

183
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,250
They were weak...
Just like you are!

184
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,125
Weak and not
worth my time...

185
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,000
Hraah!

186
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,041
Huh? Hunh?!

187
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,750
[thinking] He's fast!

188
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
[GOKU]
Come on, Gohan...

189
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,416
[GOKU] Hey, Krillin!
Are you alright?

190
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,416
Fantastic!

191
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,958
I was a little late.
Sorry... But it's okay now.

192
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,041
Oh, I almost forgot! Special
delivery from Korin. Here...

193
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:06,625
[KRILLIN] Wow! A Senzu Bean!
I sure am glad to see that!

194
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,875
[GOKU] This was
his last one...

195
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,041
[KRILLIN] Whoa!
Wait a minute!

196
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,708
Maybe you should
keep it then...

197
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,166
[GOKU] Nah, I've already had
one for myself, Krillin.

198
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,083
This one's
for you!

199
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,083
I'd be wasting it!

200
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,208
You'll need it, if
you're gonna try

201
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,916
and take down both
of these guys...

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,666
It's your help that
I might need...

203
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,875
That's the truth,
Krillin, I promise!

204
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
Here, take half...

205
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,708
Thanks, Goku...

206
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,000
[GOKU] The other half's
for you, Gohan...

207
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,625
[KRILLIN] We gotta learn
how to grow those beans!

208
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,125
[GOKU] Krillin, you've gotten
a lot stronger. I can feel it.

209
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,250
Yeah, I was doing great
until the fighting started!

210
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,333
We've all improved!
Thanks to Kami, of course!

211
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:59,666
But, man... I guess...
It just wasn't enough!

212
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,333
Hey, Gohan, you
look stronger, too!

213
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,458
I can tell you've
been training hard!

214
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,208
Mm-hm. Piccolo's been taking
care of me. He was great!

215
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,541
And he taught me
so many things...

216
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,875
Now he's gone... and it's...
it's up to us to bring him back.

217
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,708
I don't know how we can
do it, but we have to.

218
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,458
We just have
to, Dad!

219
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,791
[GOKU]
We will, son, we will.

220
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,708
But first, we have to focus
on taking these guys down,

221
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,750
once and for all!

222
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,958
[GOHAN whimpering]

223
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,250
You're right,
Goku! Man!

224
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,166
It's not over yet!

225
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,458
Hey! With your
increased strength,

226
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,500
and us back
at full power,

227
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,875
we should have a pretty good
chance of beating those jerks!

228
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,750
Right! But you've
done your part.

229
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,375
Maybe it's best if the two of
you sit this one out.

230
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,541
This time, I think

231
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,458
I'm gonna take them
on all by myself...

232
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,000
Goku, you can't!

233
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,875
See that big
guy over there?

234
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,250
He beat every last one of us
without even breaking a sweat!

235
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,916
The only chance we have
is to stick together!

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,708
He's right, Dad! That
guy... He's really strong!

237
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:10,916
[GOKU growling]

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,125
[KRILLIN] Oh, wow! Goku?

239
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,458
Amazing!

240
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,208
[GOHAN]
No, Dad! Don't!

241
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,750
[KRILLIN] Wait, Gohan!
Just let him go!

242
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,166
[GOHAN] Come back! Please!

243
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,416
I've never seen him
like this, Gohan.

244
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,833
He's different somehow...

245
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:37,333
I...I think we should just
do what he says...

246
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,250
[GOKU] This has gone
on long enough...

247
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,958
[GOKU] It ends, right
here, right now...

248
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,666
[NAPPA chuckling]

249
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,625
[BABA] Look deep,
deep into my crystal ball!

250
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,541
Crystal ball, show them all,
what they want to see...

251
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:12,375
Crystal ball, show them all,
their friends and family!

252
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,000
[BULMA] Look! Something's
happening! Is that...

253
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:16,875
[ROSHI] Could it be...

254
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,916
[OX KING] It's Goku!

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,125
[CHICHI gasping]

256
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,250
Go-ku...

257
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,416
[OOLONG] Look!
Krillin! And Gohan!

258
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,958
Gohan! My baby!
He's all right!

259
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,541
ChiChi! Are you okay,
dear? What a day...

260
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:38,541
Goku! Tear them up!
Come on! Knock 'em out!

261
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,958
Piccolo!

262
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,500
If Piccolo's gone...
That means...

263
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,291
Kami's gone as well!
And the Dragon Balls!

264
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,208
They're gone, too!

265
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,458
That means we...
can't wish them back?

266
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,916
Mmm...

267
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,583
[BULMA] Oh, Goku...
Be careful.

268
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,958
Come on, I haven't
got all day!

269
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,916
I wanna see what the
great Kakarot's made of!

270
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,125
Ha! You want me?
You got me!

271
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:28,750
[GOKU snarling]

272
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:41,416
[GOKU yelling]

273
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,250
All that's
from... my Dad?

274
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:50,666
Power level's... 8,000.
How? Wait! It's over nine!

275
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,333
[GOKU yelling]

276
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,166
Vegeta! What did you
say his power level is?

277
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,458
It's over 9000!

278
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:18,375
9000? There's no way
that could be right! It can't!

279
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,791
Don't be so sure...

280
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,958
I'll have you know I was
trained in the art of Kaio-Ken!

281
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,125
Huh? Kaio-Ken?

282
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,500
Kaio-whatever!
Who cares?

283
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm still
gonna crush you!

284
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,208
I don't care
what you've learned!

285
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,666
Raagh!

286
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,333
Augh!

287
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,833
Whoa! How did
he do that?

288
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:57,833
You... You'll pay for
that... You'll... pay!

289
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,291
We'll see... But I haven't
even warmed up yet...

290
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,375
What? Why you little...
That was luck!

291
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,541
I'm the second strongest
Saiyan in the universe!

292
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,666
[GOKU] Heh. Well, if your
friend is stronger than you,

293
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,125
then I'd say that makes
you the third strongest!

294
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
Heh... heh heh...

295
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,875
Kakarot... I'm gonna
rip you apart!

296
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,333
Hyaah!

297

Huuh! Hyah hyah hyah!

[NAPPA's shouting continues]

299
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,833
It's strange... Just a year
ago he couldn't beat Raditz

300
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,125
and now he's making
sport of Nappa...

301
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,708
Haahh!

302
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,375
Hah? Huh? Hunh?!

[KRILLIN] Wow... Did you see
how your father did that?!

307
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,166
Uh... Nuh-uh...
Did you?

308
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,333
[NAPPA] I'll get my hands
on you! And when I do...
