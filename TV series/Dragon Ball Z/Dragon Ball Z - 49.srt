00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:19,291
The evil Dodoria made his
presence felt on Planet Namek.

3
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,041
With ruthless precision,
he unleashed his wrath

4
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
on all who dared
oppose him!

5
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,500
And as the
rampage continued,

6
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,916
one thing became
painfully clear,

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,833
old or young,
none would be spared!

8
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,416
Gohan watched the
gruesome events unfold

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,250
until finally, he
could watch no more!

10
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,625
Stop it!!

11
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,833
[NARRATOR] The young warrior
sprang into action,

12
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:46,875
and brought Dodoria's spree
of terror crashing to a halt!

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,791
If you want him, you're
gonna have to get through me!

14
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,083
C'mon, Gohan! We gotta
get outta here! Right now!

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,458
[NARRATOR] But unfortunately,
this was only the beginning

16
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,750
of our heroes' troubles.

17
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,541
I must find out who those
little rodents are.

18
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,791
[NARRATOR] Soon, Dodoria
was in hot pursuit...

19
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,416
Gohan!

20
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,166
[NARRATOR] And Krillin
had to risk it all,

21
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,916
in an effort to
slow him down!

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,250
[KRILLIN] All right, big guy,
watch the birdie!

23
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
Solar Flare!

24
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,333
[DODORIA grunting]

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,208
[DODORIA] Ugh!
My eyes! My eyes!

26
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,708
[NARRATOR] Has the gamble
truly paid off?

27
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,416
Whadda you know?
It actually worked!

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,041
[NARRATOR]
Stay tuned!

29
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:44,291
[DODORIA growling]

30
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,541
Oh, they're dead!

31
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,750
[DODORIA]
They're close. I know it.

32
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,250
I can practically
smell them!

33
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,625
Huh. How 'bout that?
He flew right past us.

34
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,708
He's not gonna find us
without his scouter.

35
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,958
We just need to lay low
until he decides to give up.

36
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,458
Who knows?
With a little luck,

37
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,833
we might just get out
of this in one piece!

38
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,666
Bah! This is pointless.
Where are they?

39
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,791
I don't have time to
search this whole canyon.

40
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,875
You were right, Krillin.
Look, he's leaving!

41
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,541
Heh. Look what
I found here!

42
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,625
[ALL whimpering]

43
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,750
Aahh...

44
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,750
Haah!

45
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,208
[KRILLIN screaming]

46
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,416
[DODORIA chuckles]

47
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,875
[chuckling continues]

48
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:42,833
Ha! There you go. Let's see you
little insects hide from that!

49
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:47,541
[DODORIA laughs]

50
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
There's no way
they survived.

51
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,708
Frieza should be pleased.
At least I hope.

52
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,458
He did say he wanted
to know who they were.

53
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,958
[DODORIA]
But who cares?

54
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,375
After all, it doesn't
matter who they were,

55
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,625
they're dead now!

56
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,083
[DODORIA laughs]

57
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,125
[GOHAN] That was close...

58
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,375
[KRILLIN sighs]

59
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,000
No kidding. Now, c'mon.
Let's get back to Bulma.

60
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,958
Uh... Hey, can you fly?

61
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,291
Oh. Well, yes.

62
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,583
Actually, I'm
still learning.

63
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,250
[KRILLIN laughs]

64
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,333
Oh, and thanks a
lot for saving me.

65
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,666
No, don't thank me. Gohan's the
one who charged in to get you.

66
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,916
I just followed
his lead.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,416
Thanks, but, that's
not true, Krillin.

68
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,208
If it weren't for you, that guy
woulda caught us for sure!

69
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,041
[KRILLIN laughs sheepishly]

70
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,833
So, anyway, why don't
you just stick with us?

71
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:55,208
I promise, we're nowhere near
as bad as those other jerks.

72
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,458
[gasps]

73
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,750
I don't...

74
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:02,416
[BOTH laughing]

75
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,666
Well, uh... yeah!

76
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,250
[GOHAN] Great! Just
follow us. It's that way.

77
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,416
[BULMA] So, we're still trying
to get the Dragon Balls,

78
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,166
but we found out
there's this group

79
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,958
of creepy aliens here
looking for them, too.

80
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,291
I don't know
who they are,

81
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,708
but they've already
got four of them!

82
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,291
And if they
get all seven...

83
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,583
Well, it's like,
what's the point

84
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,208
of even coming here
in the first place?

85
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,166
I mean, it's not fair
if I have to suffer

86
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,958
all this hardship
for nothing!

87
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,875
Hello? Dad!
Are you listening?!

88
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,375
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, uh, o-of
course, dear. Of course...

89
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,833
Yes, that sounds
just terrible.

90
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,625
I know, and that's
not the half of it.

91
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,791
See, a couple of those
creepy alien guys

92
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,458
I'm talking about
blew up our ship!

93
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,708
So, I don't know how we're
gonna get back to Earth.

94
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,083
It looks like
we're stuck here!

95
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,958
[DR. BRIEF] Hmm...
Stuck on Namek, eh?

96
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:06,416
Well, now,
that's no good.

But, I wouldn't
worry, dear.

98
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,666
Goku is on his way there in
another ship, even as we speak.

99
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,291
I'm sure you and the boys can
catch a ride home with him.

100
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:23,375
What? You mean Goku's on his
way here? To Planet Namek?

101
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,250
That's great!
Oh, Daddy, we're saved!

102
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,125
[DR. BRIEF] Yes, I
thought you'd like that.

103
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,083
He should be there in,
oh... about six days.

it's not all good news.

107

There's still one
thing that worries me.

be a bit rough on everyone.

I see. So you have lost your
scouters. That's terrible.

159
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,333
How will you and Zarbon
ever find Frieza's backside

160
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,083
to stick your
noses in it?

161
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:56,875
Ahh!

162
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,291
[VEGETA laughs]

163
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,500
Priceless. No
wonder I was able

164
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,333
to sneak up on
you so easily.

165
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,583
Why, you little--

166
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,041
[VEGETA]
Save it.

167
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,000
[VEGETA chuckles]

168
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,833
[DODORIA growling]

169
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,375
[VEGETA] You can take
your little prize to Frieza.

170
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,333
Far be it for me
to stand in his way.

171
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,458
Here.
It's yours.

172
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,833
I'm surprised,
Vegeta.

173
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,458
I was almost certain I'd
have to pry that scouter

174
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,416
from your
lifeless fingers.

175
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,250
And to tell
you the truth,

176
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,708
I'm more than a
little disappointed

177
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:50,625
it won't come to that.
But, oh well. We had a deal.

178
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,416
[DODORIA] Ahh!
What are you doing?!

179
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:02,625
[DODORIA gasps]

180
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,208
Are... you... insane?

181
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,958
Fool! That was the last
scouter on the planet!

182
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,083
It was. And now that it's
gone, I have the advantage.

183
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,458
Ha! What are you
talking about?

184
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,833
You'll be more
lost than I will!

185
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,458
Now you'll never find
Frieza! Or the Nameks!

186
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,791
But you're wrong.

187
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,958
[chuckles]

188
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,000
You see, I've discovered
that it's possible

189
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,291
to sense power levels
without a scouter.

190
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,291
It's one of the many
things I learned

191
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,375
during my
time on Earth.

192
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
I could hardly
believe it myself.

193
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,416
But then, I was
forced to rethink

194
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,333
my notions of
impossibility.

195
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:46,541
[GOKU] Haaa!

196
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,708
Ahh! Nooo!

197
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,583
It was... an enlightening
experience, to say the least.

198
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,583
After that, it was
only a matter of time

199
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,333
before I could duplicate
the technique myself.

200
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,958
Now, I can feel the
energy in the air,

201
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,208
as easily as the
breeze upon my face.

202
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,083
Which means I've
outgrown these silly toys.

203
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,500
I get it...

204
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,333
Those little brats I chased
out here were Earthlings!

205
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,541
They were what?!

206
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,791
[DODORIA] You're
working with them!

207
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,416
You used them to lure
me away from Frieza!

208
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,875
Don't be
such an idiot.

209
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,750
There's no way
those Earth scum

210
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,541
could have gotten
here so quickly.

211
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,250
And even if
there was,

212
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,416
I doubt they'd be in a hurry
to cross my path again.

213
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,416
You are lying!
But guess what?

214
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,666
I killed your little
friends, Vegeta!

215
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,041
And if you stay,
I'll do the same to you!

216
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:50,000
Final warning.
Go now or feel my wrath!

217
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,166
No, I think I'll stay.
So go ahead. Attack me.

218
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,041
Why, Dodoria,
If I didn't know better,

219
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,083
I'd think you were
scared or something.

220
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,083
Let me guess.
You were monitoring

221
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,208
my fight with
Cui earlier.

222
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,000
You've seen
my power!

223
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,458
Zarbon.
What happened?

224
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,916
[ZARBON] I don't know. It must
be some kind of malfunction.

225
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,875
For a second there,
it registered Vegeta's

226
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,125
power level at 22,000.
And then it shorted out.

227
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,791
22,000? You've got
to be kidding me.

228
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,291
It must be that older
model scouter you're using.

229
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,458
[DODORIA gasps]

230
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,208
Well? I'm right,
aren't I?

231
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,416
So you know
you're outmatched.

232
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,416
No! That scouter
was malfunctioning!

233
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,541
You cannot be
that strong!

234
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,500
You can't!

235
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,375
Ahhh...

236
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,041
Haah!

237
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

238
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:57,250
[DODORIA growling]

239
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,875
Aahh!

240
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,875
Hah! Are you ready
to believe it now,

241
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,708
or do you still
need more proof?

242
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,291
[DODORIA] Huh? Haah!

243
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,666
[DODORIA grunting]

244
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:16,083
[DODORIA screaming]

245
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,666
[VEGETA laughing maniacally]

246
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,708
[VEGETA] It's the true
might of a Saiyan warrior!

247
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,625
[DODORIA screaming]

248
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,541
The more we fight, the
stronger our opponents,

249
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,291
the stronger we become.

250
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,375
So, you see, these Earth
fools did me a favor

251
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,541
when they
almost killed me.

252
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,125
I'm more powerful now
than you can imagine.

253
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:44,666
[DODORIA growling]

254
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,583
[VEGETA laughing]

255
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,416
It's amazing what
a coward you can become

256
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,208
when you're not hiding
behind your master, isn't it?

257
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,208
Too bad Frieza won't
save you this time!

258
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,500
Wait, Vegeta! Please don't
do this to me! I can help you!

259
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,916
I know what really
happened to your homeworld!

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,291
[DODORIA yelling]

261
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,166
What's this?

262
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,750
Planet Vegeta was destroyed!
It's gone forever.

263
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,291
What else is
there to know?

264
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,541
If you kill me now,
you're never going to find out!

265
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:28,500
[DODORIA groaning]

266
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,041
Now, if I tell you,

267
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,583
how do I know you won't
still try to kill me?

268
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,958
You're lucky I don't
kill you where you stand!

269
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,208
So start talking!

270
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,416
Fine, but remember,
I'm only the messenger.

271
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Now, as you know, when
your planet was destroyed,

272
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,500
Frieza told you it had been
struck by a massive meteorite.

273
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,875
Well, that was a lie.

274
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,791
What are you saying?

275
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,041
[DODORIA]
Isn't it obvious?

276
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,541
I'm saying it was
Frieza, not a meteorite

277
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,041
that destroyed
your planet

278
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,666
along with the
entire Saiyan race!

279
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,125
[DODORIA chuckles]

280
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,333
[DODORIA] You see, Frieza
had been using the Saiyans

281
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,375
to do his dirty
work for years.

282
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,791
Compared to many,
they made for

283
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,291
a fairly impressive
breed of warriors.

284
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,541
And since no Saiyan could ever
match Frieza's awesome power,

285
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,625
they were also
relatively easy to control.

286
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,875
Frieza sent teams of Saiyans
to the planets he wanted,

287
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,750
where they would use
their distinctive powers

288
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,541
of transformation to
clear out the opposition.

289
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,125
And for a while, it was a
very productive arrangement.

290
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,500
But over time,
things changed.

291
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,708
While Frieza could still
easily defeat any Saiyan,

292
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,750
several extraordinary fighters,

293
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,833
such as yourself, Vegeta,
were beginning to emerge.

294
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,708
[DODORIA chuckles]

295
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,208
[DODORIA] With
each new victory,

296
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,750
you were becoming more and
more difficult to control.

297
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,083
Your pride was making
you arrogant. Too arrogant.

298
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,375
[VEGETA growling]

299
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,166
[DODORIA] Frieza
could see that it

300
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,458
wouldn't be long
before you tried

301
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,791
to challenge him for
control of the galaxy.

302
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,208
And if left unchecked

303
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,291
he feared that the collective
strength of your race

304
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,958
might actually pose a
serious threat to his power.

305
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,083
And so...

306
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,500
the threat was eliminated.

307
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,583
[DODORIA] With just the
slightest flick of his finger,

308
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,125
your supposedly
mighty civilization

309
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,500
was reduced
to rubble.

310
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:38,041
[FRIEZA cackling]

311
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,000
But you should be
thankful, Vegeta,

312
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,291
being a prince, and as
talented in battle as you are,

313
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,291
Frieza thought you still
might be useful to us.

314
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,416
[DODORIA] So he sent
you away from the planet

315
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,166
on a special assignment
before he destroyed it.

316
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,000
Personally, I don't know
that I would have made

317
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,208
the same decision.

318
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,708
But then, it wasn't
my decision to make.

319
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,500
[DODORIA] Well, there you
have it. The awful truth.

320
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,791
And now that I've lived up to
my end of our little bargain,

321
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,541
I'll be on my way.

322
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,916
You're not
going anywhere.

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,041
Wait a second!

324
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,708
You will pay for
your part in this,

325
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,416
just as Frieza soon will.
But I want you to know

326
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,250
I do this, not for my
planet, not for my race,

327
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,750
but because you
thought you could make

328
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,666
the Prince of Saiyans
a slave to your whim!

329
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,875
[DODORIA] Lord Frieza!

330
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:38,666
[VEGETA growls]

331
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,750
[VEGETA yells]

332
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,125
[DODORIA grunting]

333
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,083
[screaming]

334
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,958
I promise you
this, Frieza...

335
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,458
Your downfall will be at
the hands of a Saiyan!

336
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,416
[GOKU] All right. Time
to get back to work.

337
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,041
I think just one last
session at 20 times gravity

338
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,125
and then I'll be able
to turn it up a notch!

339
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,458
[GOKU] 'Kay! 10,000 push-ups.

340
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:36,166
[GOKU grunting]

341
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,708
[NARRATOR]
Goku's intensive training

342
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,541
is beginning to bear results,

343
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,250
but in just a
few days time,

344
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,708
his journey will take
him to Planet Namek,

345
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:47,583
where he must once again face
the ruthless might of Vegeta.

346
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,083
Will our hero be ready
to meet the challenge?

347
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:55,416

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
