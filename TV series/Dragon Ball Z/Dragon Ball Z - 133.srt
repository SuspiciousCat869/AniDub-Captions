00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,916
Bulma made a shocking discovery.

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,375
The maniacal Android
20 is none other

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
than Dr. Gero himself.

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
And he's not about to
surrender without a fight.

6
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,041
In a final desperate
attempt to escape,

7
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,291
the diabolical doctor unleashed
a powerful energy blast

8
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,666
that sent Bulma
into a tailspin!

9
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,208
[BULMA screams]

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,666
NARRATOR] Much to the relief
of Tien, Gohan, and Krillin,

11
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,291
however, Trunks, the
boy from the future,

12
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,375
was on the scene to
perform a daring rescue.

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,958
--[BABY TRUNKS cries]
--[BULMA] Wow! I'm still alive!

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,625
--[BABY TRUNKS cries]
--Ah! Where's my baby?!

15
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,208
[NARRATOR] But unlike Bulma,
Vegeta was none too happy

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,208
to see Trunks again,
for it seemed

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,625
that the young
Saiyan's predictions

18
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,208
had been less than accurate.

19
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,625
[TRUNKS] The timeline as I
know it must have shifted!

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Vegeta flew off
to challenge the androids

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,125
on his own, but Trunks was
determined to stop him.

22
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
For although history may
have been slightly altered,

23
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
terrible dangers
still lie lay ahead!

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,958
[PICCOLO] We're really
going to have to move fast!

25
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
[TIEN] Right!

26
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,583
[NARRATOR] Dr. Gero
races to his laboratory

27
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,708
to activate the fearsome
Androids 17 and 18.

28
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,458
And unless our
heroes can stop him,

29
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,291
it could mean the
end of the world.

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,958
[TRUNKS thinking]
I can't believe my father

31
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,250
is so stubborn and
self-centered!

32
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,041
If that's the case, then we
might just have a chance

33
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,291
to find this lab and destroy
the other two androids

34
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,458
before Gero even gets there!

35
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,000
I would never do
something that cowardly!

36
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,500
[TRUNKS gasps]

37
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,916
Only one course of action
can possibly satisfy me!

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,083
I will fight these
androids face-to-face!

39
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,458
And I will break them
with my bare hands!

40
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,958
You must never
underestimate the power

41
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,583
of the androids!

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
If you really want
to destroy them,

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,500
we have to do this
Piccolo's way!

44
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
[VEGETA chuckles]

45
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,416
[thinking]
Unless I can stop him,

46
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
his arrogance is going
to get him killed!

47
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,750
[thinking] Don't these
fools understand?

48
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,708
I am one of the Saiyan elite!

49
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,250
And now that I'm a Super Saiyan,
my powers are second to none!

50
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,541
Hmph! "Wait for
Kakarot" indeed!

51
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
I will grind these
Androids into dust!

[TIEN] Not yet, but we
should be getting really close!

[PICCOLO] Yes!
That's it all right!

North City...

So which one of
these mountains looks

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,125
like the best place to
put a lab to you guys?

[VEGETA] Would you
stop following me, boy?!

96
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
You're getting on my nerves!

97
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,083
[TRUNKS] Sorry, but there's
no way I'm going to let you

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,416
fight the Androids on your own!

99
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,583
And just what are you
planning to do to stop me?

100
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,416
It's going to take more than
that little sword of yours

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,625
to stand in my way!

102

How many times
do I have to tell you

103
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,666
before it sinks into
your thick skull?!

104
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,416
Never underestimate the
power of the androids!

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,958
Ha! And never underestimate
a true Super Saiyan

106
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,250
who loves taking
on a challenge.

107

Well, if you're
going to stay,

00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,916
you can at least help
me find Dr. Gero's lab!

[TRUNKS growls]

00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,916
You are
totally impossible!

111

Could you
hurry up, Gohan?

your belly-aching already?!

It's poor Gohan who's
doing all the work!

It's okay, Bulma...

I'm just sick of
Yajirobe's whining!

I hope you turn out to
be just like Gohan!

have to worry about him!

122
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,666
From what I've seen, I'd say the
grown-up Trunks is pretty cool!

[BULMA] You're right!
He is cool, isn't he?

He's not that cool...

you if he hears

you were giving his

exactly how mean

No, you can't tell!
I'll do anything!

[GOHAN] What do you have against
Trunks anyway, Yajirobe?

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,958
He's the one who warned
us about the Androids,

150
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,458
and he may have
saved my dad's life

151
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
by bringing him that
medicine from the future!

works like he said it would...

Your dad's going to be fine!

159
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,041
[TIEN] You know,
I didn't exactly think

160
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,833
that finding Dr. Gero's
lab would be easy...

161
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,208
But this? This is ridiculous!

162
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,833
I mean, considering the
fact that we can't sense

163
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,833
the androids' power
and the fact that we have

164
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,916
about a million
mountains to choose from,

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,750
I'd say it just
might take a while.

166
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,041
I say we split up and
whoever finds the lab first

167
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,750
sends out a signal.

168
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,208
What kind of signal did you
have in mind, Piccolo?

169
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,541
Raise your power level
so we can all sense it.

Oh man, it's
freezing up here!

172
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,041
I know... But this is
no time to complain!

173
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,625
Just one more reason I'm
glad I'm not an Earthling.

174
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,875
Now we'd better get moving!
We don't have much time!

175
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,875
Okay, let's do it! I'll head
a little further north

176
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
and see what I
can find up there.

177
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,166
Hey, wait a sec!

178
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,916
What's the problem now?!

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
[KRILLIN] Nothing. I just
thought it'd be a good idea

180
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,375
if I gave you some Senzu
Beans before you went!

181
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh yeah... Good call!

182
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,291
[KRILLIN] I've got
exactly six beans left.

183
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,958
That means we get two each.

184
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,875
Here's yours...

185
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
and here's yours.

186
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,458
[PICCOLO] Thanks, Krillin,
but let's just hope

187
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,166
we don't have to use them.

188
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,708
Just as I had hoped.

189

Those meddlesome fools are still
searching for my laboratory!

190

It will take them
hours to find it!

191

me life, Doctor.

to become an android...

have eternal life like you.

But we have pressing
matters at hand.

In the past, the two
of you have displayed

280
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,000
an unacceptable tendency
to disobey my orders.

281
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,833
I blame myself for this,
and the way I programmed you.

282
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,541
I have since modified your
programming, however.

tolerate insubordination!

00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,541
Now go out there
and finish them!

319
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,125
[DR. GERO] Huh?!

320
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,583
Android 17! What are you doing?!

321
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,083
This is the controller you used
to deactivate us last time,

322
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,958
isn't it Dr. Gero?

323
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,583
I think I'd better
hold on to it.

324
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,083
--[DR. GERO whimpers]
--What? You disagree...?

325
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,416
Then let's try
another idea...

326
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,125
[DR. GERO] What?!
What have you done?!

327
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,958
You dare to defy me?!
I created you!

328
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,791
You're not going to put us
to sleep again, old man.

329
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,666
[DR. GERO growls]

330
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,166
[VEGETA] Hurry up, Namek! But
don't destroy those Androids

331
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,875
before I get a chance
to fight them!

332
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,625
[TRUNKS] Picolo,
don't listen to him!

333
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,583
He doesn't know
what he's saying!

334
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,625
Be quiet!

335
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,208
[DR. GERO] Enough
of this nonsense, 17!

336
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,916
I order you to go out there

337
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,875
and exterminate the
intruders at once!

338
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,416
[KRILLIN screams]

339
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,541
What do we do now, you guys?!
He's activated the Androids!

340
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,458
[VEGETA] Get out of
my way, you idiots!

341
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,875
--Huh?!
--Huh?

342
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,125
Don't do it! We can't beat
the androids without Goku!

343
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,458
Stop it!

344
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,041
You don't understand how
powerful they really are!

345
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,291
Too late, kid!

346
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,750
[VEGETA yells]

347
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,875
[DR. GERO] Huh?!

348
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,666
[VEGETA] Well, well...

349
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,375
What have we here that
has you all so nervous?

350
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,000
A boy with long hair and
a scarf around his neck,

351
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,291
and a beautiful young girl.

352
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,041
I take it these are
the scary androids

353
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,708
we've heard so much about?

354
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,500
That's them.

355
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,666
[NARRATOR] Our heroes have
finally come face-to-face

356
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,083
with the Androids of
Trunks' predictions!

357
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,958
But can they really
be as terrible

358
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,791
as the young Saiyan claims?

359
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:54,125
