on Dragon Ball Z...

Bulma, Krillin, and
Gohan set out on a quest

for the Dragon Balls
on Planet Namek.

But on the way, they ran into
some big trouble... Literally!

[NARRATOR] An in-flight
collision should have

8
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,291
spelled doom for the young
travelers, but instead

9
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,041
they found themselves
mysteriously transported

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,250
into the belly of
an alien vessel,

11

Easy now, everyone. We're
not trying to hurt anybody.

have been surrounded

by what appears to be a
well-equipped army of children!

[GOHAN] Please, listen!
We can explain.

You must have us confused
with someone else.

us all killed!

00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,458
[KRILLIN] Bulma, wait!

164
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,208
I say we throw these liars
out of the airlock! Now!

165
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,000
[ZESHIN]
I don't think so.

166
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,500
Zeshin?

167
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,416
It's all right, everyone.
You can put your weapons down.

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,791
Have you lost
your mind?!

169
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,875
These three are
allies with Frieza!

170
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,125
We have to treat them
like a serious threat

171
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
and eliminate them!

172
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,833
If they're allies
with Frieza,

173
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,416
explain to me why
they chose to help us.

174
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,375
They would have killed us just
like he killed our parents.

175
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
These people actually
care about us.

176
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,375
They aren't like
Frieza and his men!

177
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,666
They wouldn't
attack us

178
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
in the middle of the
night without warning us!

179
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,208
Get to safety!
Leave us behind!

180
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,000
I remember...

181
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,208
Run, Boon!

182
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,416
[remembering]
Mother! Father, no!

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,208
Hide before
they see you!

184
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,666
[screaming]

185
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,791
[evil laughter]

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,041
[yelling]

187
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,791
I... think we
can trust them.

188
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,541
Boon?

189
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,958
Well, I'm glad you
guys believe us now.

190
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,833
I wonder if the
people who attacked

191
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,125
with Frieza
were Saiyans?

192
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey, do you remember if
the people that conquered

193
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,791
your planet had tails that
came out about this far?

194
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,625
A tail? I didn't see
a tail on any of them.

195
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,625
Oh. Well, so much for that
brilliant theory, Krillin.

196
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,708
That means there's a group
of warriors out there

197
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,916
even more evil
than Saiyans.

198
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,375
What kind of a planet
did you live on?

199
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,583
I mean
before Frieza?

200
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
Our planet
was successful.

201
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:14,000
A truly wonderful and
peaceful place to live.

202
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,541
Until that
terrible night!

203
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,875
When they took
our innocence...

204
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,333
[screaming]

205
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,291
[ZESHIN] It was an ambush.
We never even saw them coming.

206
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,000
When they arrived they
said the planet

207
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,500
now belonged
to Frieza

208
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,583
and anyone who didn't name
him as ruler would be killed.

209
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,458
Most of the people gave in and
professed Frieza as their King,

210
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
but the invaders had no
intention of allowing us

211
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,458
to live in the
first place.

212
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,833
They murdered everyone who
came across their path.

213
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,291
Women, children... There was
no limit to the carnage.

214
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
It was terrible.

215
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,500
It must have been very
difficult for you to escape.

216
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,041
The few adults who realized
Frieza's true intentions

217
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,875
were able to
cover long enough

218
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
for their kids to
make an escape.

219
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,208
Those that were lucky enough to
make it to their ships in time

220
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,916
were eventually
destroyed in space.

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We only avoided
being destroyed

222
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,000
because of our
mirrored exterior.

223
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,958
This ship has mirrors
on the outside?

224
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,125
That explains why you
showed up on radar,

225
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,125
yet we couldn't actually
see you with our eyes.

226
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,291
Your people must have
brilliant scientific minds

227
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,041
to create
such a ship.

228
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,375
So, where in the galaxy
are you headed to now?

229
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,000
Anywhere specific?

230
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
That's right.
There is a planet

231
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,666
that my father
used to visit

232
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,791
from time to time for
trading purposes.

233
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,333
And I just know that
they will be willing

234
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,291
to accept us
without question.

235
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,875
Is this
planet far?

236
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,708
Yes it is. But we're willing,
even if it takes years.

237
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,708
Ha, ha!

238
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,208
[BOTH chuckling]

239
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,083
Well, good luck
to all of you.

240
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,291
Thanks, guys.
And same to you.

241
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,375
We'll see ya!

242
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,833
[CHILDREN laughing]

243
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,916
Let's go,
boys.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,333
We have a lot of
time to make up,

245
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,083
thanks to this
little detour.

246
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,083
It's okay,
Bulma.

247
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not like Namek
is gonna go anywhere.

248
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,375
Wait a minute...

249
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,958
You three are all trying
to get to the planet Namek?

250
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,291
Sure are.
You've heard of it?

251
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,875
I think we passed it
around 2 or 3 weeks ago.

252
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,666
If you head in the
direction of K-5162,

253
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,833
you'll find about a 10
day shortcut to Namek.

254
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,458
A shortcut?

255
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,041
U-Uh-huh.

256
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:50,666
So head towards K-5162,
huh? Thank you! Let's go!

257
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,958
[GOHAN chuckling]

258
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,875
Ah! If you take the
shortcut, don't forget--

259
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,958
[BOON] That was an
interesting visit.

260
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,458
Huh, Zeshin?

261
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,541
They turned out to be
nice people after all.

262
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

263
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,958
Well... We should
get going ourselves!

264
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,500
Sounds good!
You guys ready?

265
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,500
[cheering]

266
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,166
Navigate to planet Namek
through the K-5162 system.

267
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,250
I'm glad they
mentioned that shortcut.

268
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,500
What's the matter?

269
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,625
Oh, I was just wondering
who this Frieza guy is

270
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,041
they kept
talking about.

271
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,375
Well, they said the attackers
weren't Saiyans, right?

272
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:51,000
It just sounded like
something Saiyans would do.

273
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,000
Just forget about
it, Krillin!

274
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,208
Try to get
some sleep.

275
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,333
I'll see you guys... 
Whenever I wake up.

276
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,541
[SUBORDINATE 1]
Hey, look.

277
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[siren beeping]

278
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,791
[SUBORDINATE 2]
Something's coming.

279
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,666
[beeping continues]

280
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,791
[SUBORDINATE 1] Is it Frieza?!

281
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,958
[SUBORDINATE 2] No! That's
impossible.

282
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,000
I think I recognize
that signal.

283
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,000
Of course!
It's Vegeta.

284
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,458
Well, that's
strange, isn't it?

285
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,833
Something must
have happened...

286
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,375
I never got an
arrival report.

287
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes... Control
tower, come in.

288
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,000
Vegeta is here.
Prepare for his arrival.

289
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
Look! Up there!

290
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,041
There's only one
pod! Where's Nappa?

291
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
What is he doing?
He should be out by now!

292
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm receiving a very low
life-force reading on him.

293
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,041
What?!

294

his life support system!

him to the treatment center.

[BULMA] Don't worry,
Krillin.

302
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,625
This shortcut takes us through
a recently exploded nebula.

303
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,750
It's just a storm in space.
Don't be a wimp.

how can she sleep

I think
it stopped.

on me again while I'm sleeping!

worse than it really was.

00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,541
[BULMA gasps]

321
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
[BULMA laughing]

322
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,125
Woah, that looks
like it hurts a lot.

323
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,333
[BULMA] Guys!
Check this out!

324
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,625
Yes! It's Namek!
We finally made it!

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,708
That sure was a fast
trip, huh, guys?

326
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,958
If it weren't for
that shortcut,

327
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,583
we'd only be
halfway there.

328
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,583
Are you
sure that's...

329
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,083
Planet Namek?

330
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,375
Trust me, it's the
right planet!

331
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,041
Now, let's go and find
those Dragon Balls!

332
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,500
[NARRATOR] Bulma believes they
have arrived at planet Namek,

333
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,875
though Krillin and Gohan
have their doubts.

334
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,083
They're about to discover
whose hunch is correct

335
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,375
as they prepare for their
landing. What mysteries await?

336
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,333
Find out, on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
