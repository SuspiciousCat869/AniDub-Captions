1
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,708
Kami finally agreed
to unite with Piccolo.

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,458
No Kami, don't!

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,708
[yells]

5
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,291
[NARRATOR] It was a difficult
decision to say the least,

6
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,916
but in his wisdom, and in spite
of the great personal cost,

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,416
Kami chose to do what he felt
was best for the earth!

8
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,875
His fusion with Piccolo
would be a noble sacrifice,

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,416
after which Kami
would no longer exist

10
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,625
and Piccolo would
be changed forever.

11
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,291
[NARRATOR] Their union complete,
Piccolo stood reborn.

12
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,333
Now that Kami's
vast knowledge and power

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,958
had been added to his own,

14
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,666
Piccolo was no longer
his former self.

15
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,250
He had become a Super Namek!

16
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,750
I'll miss you. Good-bye, Kami.

17
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,708
Oh... Please be careful.

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,708
No longer am I Kami or Piccolo.

19
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,375
I am the Namek who has
long since forgotten his name.

20
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,333
[NARRATOR] While Mr. Popo
bade a final reluctant farewell

21
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,333
to his old friend,
the new and improved Piccolo

22
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,333
made his way down to the earth,

23
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,958
where beneath a
seemingly tranquil surface

24
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,041
a sinister evil laid in wait.

25
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,125
[NARRATOR] His newfound Super
Namek powers still untested,

26
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,166
Piccolo has come
face to face with the most

27
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,333
diabolical creature
ever to walk the earth!

28
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,500
[NARRATOR]
The fate of the planet

29
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,708
rests on Piccolo's
mighty shoulders!

30
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,083
But is the noble
Namek warrior prepared for

31
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,416
what this hideous monster
has in store?

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,666
The new face
of evil has arrived!

33
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,041
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

34
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,166
At last we meet...
face to face...

35
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:43,208
[CREATURE growls lowly]

36
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,166
[PICCOLO] Hmmm?!

[CREATURE growls lowly]

38
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:57,250
Hey, you gotta help me,
please! Help me!

39
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,125
What the...?!

40
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,583
What am I sensing
from that thing?!

41
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,541
His... power...

42
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,375
I've sensed it
somewhere before!

43
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,750
Please, I beg of you!
You have to help me! Please!

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,625
Please! I'm in more than
a little pain here!

45
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,708
This doesn't look good.

46
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,625
I'm afraid this new monster,
it may be too powerful.

47
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,708
[POPO] Even with
their strengths combined,

48
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,125
Kami and Piccolo may not
be able to win this fight!

49
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,166
[POPO] Oh, Kami...

50
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,833
If there was only
something I could do...

51
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,666
[MAN A] C'mon!
What're you waiting for?!

Help me!

00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,500
Listen! I'm the
richest man in town

54
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,250
and I'll give you
whatever you want!

55

Here, take this! And there's
more where that came from!

Hey! Are you listening?!

58
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,375
You would be wise
to let him go.

59

You've done enough already.

60

No! Far from it, in fact!

It's... Frieza...!

Frieza... He's here

[laughing]

164
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,541
I think it's Piccolo!

165
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,583
[KRILLIN]
Ha-ha! He did it! Yeah!

166
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,833
What did he do?

167
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,458
Must've been something
pretty radical

168
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,583
if he's changed this much.

169
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,708
That's right, Trunks!
He's united with Kami!

170
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,625
[TRUNKS] United? Wait...
You told me about this before!

171
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,958
You said that Piccolo and Kami
were originally one being,

172
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,750
and that if they ever
reunited they'd be

173
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,875
even stronger
than a Super Saiyan!

174
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,000
Yep, that's right.
Piccolo's become a Super Namek!

175
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,708
Super Namek...

176
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,708
His power level must be amazing!

[PICCOLO grunting]

178
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,750
You know, you've made
one critical mistake.

179
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,416
You never should have
emptied this city

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
of its entire population!

181
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
Why is that?

182
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,041
[PICCOLO]
Because as long as there are

183
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
no innocent bystanders
to get in the way,

184
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,375
I'm free to fight you
with the best of my ability!

[CREATURE]
So what's stopping you?

[PICCOLO] You know,
that's a really good question!

[KRILLIN] Yeah, no kidding!

[ANDROID 18] What was that?

201
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
[ANDROID 17] It felt like
some sort of an explosion.

202
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,458
And a big one, too.
I wonder what it was.

203
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,041
It was much too far away
to tell where it came from.

[car door opens]

205
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,333
[ANDROID 16]
It came from Gingertown.

206
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,750
[ANDROID 17 and 18] Hm?

207
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,583
[ANDROID 16] Two enormous
powers are fighting there.

208
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,208
Hm...

209
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,958
[ANDROID 17] You mean your
sensors can detect power levels?

210
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,375
Why didn't you
tell us that before?

211
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,791
Because you did not ask!

212
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,208
All right. Fair enough.

213
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,583
Now I don't suppose
you can tell me

214
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,500
who it is that's
fighting, can you?

215
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,041
[ANDROID 16] No, I cannot.

216
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,041
I do not recognize
either of these powers.

217
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,583
My sensors indicate
that one of the fighters

218
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,041
is just as strong as you, 17.

What's that?

[ANDROID 16]
My sensors indicate that--

Quiet! I heard what you said
quite clearly the first time.

00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,000
Your "sensors"
must be malfunctioning!

Nobody is as strong as I am.

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm the most powerful
fighter there is!
