[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,333
the unknown soldier
efficiently disposed

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,791
of the treacherous Frieza

and his diabolical
father, King Cold!

[NARRATOR] Keeping his
identity a secret,

6
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,416
the stranger proceeded to
predict the time and place

7
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,583
of Goku's return to Earth,
down to the second.

8
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,708
[BULMA] Wait for me!

9
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,333
[NARRATOR] And when
a spacecraft landed

10
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,166
right where the
stranger had predicted,

11
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,083
it looked like the star-voyaging
hero had finally returned.

00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,416
What took you so long, Dad?

16
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,875
Where did he get that outfit?

17
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,333
How did you guys know
that I was coming?

18
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,500
The identity of the mystery
man is unveiled, today!

19
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,083
Oh, Goku! Hey!

20
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,583
--What's up?
--Hi, Daddy!

21
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,708
Check him out!

22
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,000
You're the man!

23
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,375
[GOKU] Hi, you guys!

24
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,583
How in the world did you
know I was going to be here?

25
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,041
This guy told us!
He's a mystery man!

26
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,333
I think he might
be a fan of yours.

27
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,125
He knows all about you, Daddy!

28
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,583
Huh?

29
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,000
But how?

30
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,291
[ALL] Huh?

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,541
[BULMA] He knew the exact time
and place of your arrival, Goku!

32
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,458
[GOKU] That's impossible!
We've never even met!

33
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,958
Well, that's what he said.

34
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,833
Then he must have been tracking
your ship in outer space.

35
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,250
Really? I don't know...
Frieza tried to do that.

36
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,958
But I could sense his energy
level as he passed me.

37
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,958
He sure was in a hurry
to beat me home.

38
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,208
But my gosh! What in the world
happened here, you guys?

39
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,875
Who defeated Frieza?

40
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:12,958
You, Piccolo?

41
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,500
Or was it you, Vegeta?

42
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:19,083
Neither of us did. It was
this guy. He did it with ease.

43
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,500
[GOKU] Huh...?

44
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,958
He turned into a Super Saiyan
and picked him apart.

45
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,416
What? A Super Saiyan?

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,208
I can't believe it!
That's outstanding!

47
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,458
Can you imagine? A Super
Saiyan at his age! Fantastic!

48
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,583
Hey! Aren't you
forgetting something?!

49
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:41,416
You, your son, and I are
the only Saiyans still alive!

50
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,875
Hm.. Well, if he says
he's a Super Saiyan,

51
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,958
then that's good enough for me.

52
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,708
Oh, honestly, Goku!

53
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,541
You take things way
too lightly sometimes!

54
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,750
[GOKU] No, I don't.

55
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,750
Goku!

56
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,750
Hm?

57
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,541
[BOY] Could I have
a word with you?

58
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,541
With me?

59
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,958
[BOY] Yes. Just the two of us.

60
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,791
[ALL] Huh?

61
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,583
All right, then.

62
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,625
[YAMCHA] Hey! What exactly
is this guy trying to say?

63
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,166
[GOKU] It's okay, guys!
I'll be right back.

64
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,666
Hmph!

65
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,875
Hmph!

66
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,291
[TRUNKS] Thanks, man.

67
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,458
Hey, no problem! But shoot!

68
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,583
I should be thanking you
for beating Frieza!

69
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,541
I had a chance to finish him,

70
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,125
but I was only fooling myself,
thinking that he might change.

71
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,625
Not him.

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,583
He was out of control and you
were supposed to stop him.

73
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,625
But when he landed
and you weren't around,

74
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,000
I had to step in. I didn't
think you would make it.

75
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,875
Yeah, his ship was a
lot faster than mine

76
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,875
and he gained two hours on me!

77
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,458
I knew he was going to
hurt the people here!

78
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,500
I was about to make my move!

79
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,375
But then you came along!

80
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,666
And just how were you
going to make a move

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,875
when you were two
hours away in space?

82
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,833
Well, thanks to a
technique I learned,

83
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,458
I could have been
there in seconds!

84
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,708
Are you serious?

85
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,375
Yeah! It's called
Instant Transmission!

86
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,791
You mean time travel?!

87
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,416
No, you dematerialize and
travel as a mass of light!

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,041
You'd be surprised how
much ground you can cover

going one hundred and eighty
six thousand miles per second!

90
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,833
[BOY] No kidding? I had no
idea that you had that ability!

91
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,791
[GOKU] Yeah, the people
on Yardrat taught it to me!

92
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,083
They weren't very strong,

93
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,333
but they knew some
amazing techniques!

94
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,500
And I think they liked me
because I could eat as much

95
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,375
as they could!

96
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,750

Huh...?

98
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,583
If I had known that you didn't
need my help with Frieza,

99
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,125
I could have waited and come
to you while you were alone

100
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,083
and avoided the risk of
meeting all the others!

101
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,083
The risk? What d'ya mean?

102
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,125
[BOY] Okay, I don't mind
answering that question.

103
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,500
But first let me
ask you something:

104
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,791
Can you transform into
a Super Saiyan at will?

105
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,541
[GOKU] Well, at first
I wasn't able to.

106
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,958
It happened spontaneously.
But now I can control it.

107
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,250
Alright then. Can you
show me right now?

108
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,541
Huh?

109
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,375
Please, Goku.

new outfit! It's cool!

they're talking about?

look pretty serious.

that much power?!

00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,208
But I'm not from this time, I
traveled here in a time machine,

163
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,041
twenty years from the future.

164
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,666
Really? From the future?
That's incredible!

165
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,666
Yes, Vegeta was right.

166
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,125
Only he, yourself, and
Gohan have Saiyan blood!

167
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,166
And I got mine from him.
He's my father.

168
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,583
What?! Your kidding!

169
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,375
Wow! You're absolutely sure
that Vegeta's your father?!

170
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,083
Yes, I'm half Saiyan,
half Earthling!

171
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:08,000
[GOKU] You're serious!
Vegeta's son. My gosh!

172
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:13,625
[GOKU] Yes, yes, I can see
the resemblance! Wow...

173
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,083
[TRUNKS] I will be born
two years from now.

174
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,625
[GOKU] Ha, ha, ha! No kidding!
Vegeta's going to be a daddy!

175
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,416
That's incredible! Man,
who would have ever thought?!

176
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Goku! I didn't come
here to tell you that.

177
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,000
I have to talk to
you about something.

178
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,583
In three years, on the
morning of May 12th at 10AM,

179
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,333
a horribly destructive
duo will show up

180
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,458
on an island nine miles
southwest of South City!

181
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,583
They have dreadful power,
even by our standards!

182
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,291
They're monsters, Goku!

183
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,541
That's the best way I know to
describe them: they're monsters!

184
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,541
Once this pair surfaces,

185
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,000
the Earth and everything you
know will be gone for good.

186
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,916
What's the deal?
Are they aliens?

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,041
No. They're both androids
created right here on Earth.

188
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,666
Their creator is Gero!

189
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,125
Doctor Gero,

190
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,291
the mastermind responsible
for the old Red Ribbon Army.

191
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,666
Do you remember?

192
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,875
Yeah! I defeated them!

193
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,458
[BULMA] Man, for two guys
who don't know each other,

194
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,291
they sure do have
a lot to talk about!

195
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,291
But, hey! Talking's not bad.
It's a lot better than fighting.

196
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,541
Uhh...

197
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,833
At least he doesn't have
his sword out anymore.

198
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,625
[KRILLIN] Yeah, and your dad
put his finger away, too.

199
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,125
No way! Same guy? Wow!

200
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:47,791
[TRUNKS] That's him.

201
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,291
But how? He lived?

202
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,708
[TRUNKS] Thanks to you!

203
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,125
[GOKU groans]

204
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,625
[TRUNKS] Yes! That's one
battle that you're going to wish

205
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,041
you fought to the very end.

206
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,708
Look, I'm sorry
to say that, Goku.

207
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,583
I know you're a good person.

208
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,958
But letting Doctor Gero
escape was a mistake

209
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,083
that will come back to haunt
you and everyone you know.

210
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,541
He's probably working on
those monsters as we speak.

211
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,666
I'm still not sure where
his laboratory is...

212
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,625
If I knew, I'd be paying
him a visit, instead of you.

213
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,333
It's hard to describe
these creatures, Goku!

214
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,333
They're unlike anyone
you've ever faced.

215
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,625
Nothing even comes close
to rivaling the technology

216
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,250
that gave them birth.

217
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,375
It's mind boggling
how strong they are.

218
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,416
What's his plan?

219
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,625
What's Doctor Gero trying
to accomplish with them?

220
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,208
No one really knows.

221
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,083
The moment those things were
able to think for themselves,

222
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,625
they rebelled.

223
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,375
And they've had
their own twisted,

224
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,416
merciless agenda
ever since then...

225
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,250
There's no rhyme or
reason to what they do.

226
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,583
They're machines of
destruction! Man-eaters!

227
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,666
Their first act after being born

228
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,083
was to turn on their own
creator, Doctor Gero himself!

229
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,291
[DR. GERO] No!
What are you doing?!

230
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,875
You can't harm me! I made you!

231
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,250
[DR. GERO] Nooo!

232
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,208
These androids are ruthless!

233
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,916
They delight in causing
pain and chaos!

234
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,333
[TRUNKS] Living on
Earth in my time

235
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,291
is like living in a nightmare!

236
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,750
Always running and hiding
and looking for a way out!

237
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,583
[GOKU] Hm, man... Gosh.

238
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,875
You defeated Frieza
in a flash, and yet,

239
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,208
from what you're saying,

240
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,708
these androids are even
stronger than you.

241
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,333
[TRUNKS] They are! For sure!

242
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,166
Hunting me down is one
of their favorite hobbies.

243
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
But it's two against one!

244
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,666
There's not much I can do
against them except run!

245
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,291
What? What about
all the others?!

246
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,250
I mean, aren't they helping you?

247
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,208
They can't...

248
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,166
[GOKU] Huh...?

249
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,500
They're dead.

250
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,500
Three years from now, the
Earth's Special Forces

251
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,958
will be gone.

252
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,583
I'm all that's left!
I'm doing the best I can!

253
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,916
They're all gone!

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,250
Vegeta! Krillin! Yamcha!
 Tien! Chiaotzu! Piccolo!

255
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,666
They're all going to lose their
lives against the androids

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,000
in a horrible battle!

257
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,125
There will be only
one survivor...

258
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,000
That's my Master and
best friend, Gohan!

259
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,333
He narrowly escapes
from that battle,

260
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:25,541
but then, thirteen years
later, they finally get him!

261
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,583
[TRUNKS growls]

262
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,041
That was four years
ago my time...

263
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,541
And as you already
know Piccolo is gone

264
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,333
so there's no chance of reviving
anyone with the Dragon Balls!

265
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,458
[YAMCHA]
Now what's the deal?

266
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,750
They look like somebody
just died over there!

267
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,416
Making the time machine also
cost us many precious lives.

268
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,416
So many have suffered at
the hands of those beasts!

269
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,250
[TRUNKS growls]

270
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,916
Darn them! Man! They're
just far too strong!

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,416
Wait a sec! Hey, Trunks!
What happens to me?

272
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,208
Do I die in the battle as well?

273
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,541
Uh-uh. You die before it.

274
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,416
Huh?

275
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,958
Not too long from now

276
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,125
you're going to catch a new
virus that attacks the heart.

277
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,791
You're going to die from it.

278
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,250
Huh?!

279
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,000
[TRUNKS] Sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

280
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,750
It's a radical virus! You'll
start hearing about it soon.

281
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,708
Not even a Super Saiyan
can beat it!

282
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,541
[GOKU] What a bummer!
Being killed by a stupid virus!

283
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:32,125
Rrgh! What a waste! Darn it!
I want to fight those androids!

284
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,375
Huh?

285
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,708
[GOKU] I don't even get
to take a crack at them!

286
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,500
You mean after
everything you've heard,

287
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,583
you still want to fight them?

288
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,250
Aren't you scared
of them at all?

289
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,958
Well, sure, a little bit!

290
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,541
All challenges
are scary at first.

291
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
Maybe I could make a difference!

292
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,625
A guy like you probably
could! You're a true warrior!

293
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,125
My Mother and Gohan were
right about you, Goku!

294
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,125
I really can trust you!
I'm glad I came.

295
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,208
Huh?

296
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,625
Here you go.

297
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,208
Take this, man. For your health.

298
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,250
My health?

299
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,833
[TRUNKS] It's an antidote.

300
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,083
[GOKU] Hmm?

301
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,750
[TRUNKS] There's no cure
now for that nasty virus

302
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,708
you're going to get,
but in my time there is.

303
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,500
Take this when you get
sick and you'll be fine.

304
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,666
You're kidding me! Wow!
Awesome! It's purple, too!

305
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,583
I'll bet it's grape flavored!

306
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,208
I shouldn't be doing this, Goku,

307
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,500
because it's going
to change history.

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,500
But some history should change.

309
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,791
Things are pretty bad.

310
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,875
We're living in fear.
With no way out, it's terrible!

311
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,958
But you can make
a difference, Goku.

312
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:37,291
My Mother told me that you
could and now I believe her!

313
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,000
Your mother knows me?

314
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,250
Am I going to meet her,
or do I already know her now?

315
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,541
Now...

316
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,833
Oh, wow! I know your
mom, huh? That's bizarre!

317
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,208
Does she live by me
or something?

318
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,625
[TRUNKS] She's standing
right there.

319
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,083
[GOKU screams with laughter]

320
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,916
Bulma's your mother?!

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,750
[laughing continues]

322
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,250
[PICCOLO gasps]

323
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,916
That guy just pointed his
finger and Kakarot fell down!

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,750
[BULMA] I could have sworn
I heard Goku call my name.

325
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,250
[GOKU] Wow! Bulma and
Vegeta, huh? Unbelievable!

326
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,375
I thought Bulma was gonna
end up marrying Yamcha!

327
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,791
But, man! Vegeta?

328
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,791
They don't stay together long.

329
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,208
It's, uh, more of a
passion kind of thing...

330
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,291
You know how stubborn they are.

331
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,541
[GOKU chuckles]

332
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,500
[YAMCHA sneezes]

333
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,875
Excuse you.

334
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,833
Yamcha and my mother
are going to break up.

335
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,083
He finds someone else
and my mom...

336
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,208
she falls in love with my dad.

337
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,291
'Course, he can never admit
that he loves my mother.

338
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,958
No shock there.

339
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,958
I know them and man-o-man!

340
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,125
They're the feistiest
two people I know.

341
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,750
I don't remember my dad.

342
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,541
So it's really great
to get to meet him.

343
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,916
He's a cranky guy,
but he's impressive.

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,666
Hey, that guy's looking
over here, isn't he?

345
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,208
Yeah, it looks
like he's smiling.

346
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,916
I know it's bizarre,

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,333
but they'll find their way
to each other pretty soon.

348
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,583
Huh...?

349
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,916
But if they get wind of
it, it might not happen.

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,416
Promise you won't tell them,
Goku, or I might not be born!

351
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,250
Hey! Not a problem!

352
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,041
[TRUNKS] Well, look,
I better be off.

353
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,125
My mom's worried sick about me.

354
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,458
She needs to know that
everything went okay.

355
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,250
[GOKU] Yeah! Please tell
her that I send my love!

356
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,625
And thanks for this!
You're great!

357
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,500
Hey! You've helped me
in a lot of ways.

358
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
I should be thanking you.

359
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,625
[GOKU] Me? What did I do?

360
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,625
[TRUNKS] Well, I've felt
alone since Gohan died.

361
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,041
He was the last person that
understood me and my power.

362
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,208
But meeting you has
inspired me, Goku.

363
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,000
It's been like finding
a long, lost brother.

364
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,041
You take care!

365
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,916
You too! You're a brave
young man, Trunks!

366
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
Now that I've met you,

367
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,375
I'll be with you in spirit
no matter where you go.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,083
[KRILLIN] Huh?!

369
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,000
[YAMCHA] Man! He didn't
even say goodbye!

370
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,291
[GOKU] Oh, man!
Now what? Three years!

371
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,833
Gosh, how am I going
to let them know?

372
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,125
--[GOHAN] Daddy!
--Huh?

373
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,333
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku!
So what did that guy say?

374
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,500
[GOKU] Oh, uh, well,
nothing important really.

375
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,875
Huh?

376
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,750
That's funny. It all sounded
pretty important to me.

377
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,625
[GOKU gasps]

378
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,666
Uh, really? You heard it all?

379
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,333
My ears do more than just
frame my face, you know, Goku.

380
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,583
[BULMA] Oh, c'mon!

381
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,166
What's so important that
you can't tell us, Goku?

382
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,416
Well, I can't really say.

383
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,583
Alright, that's fine.
But if you won't, I will.

384
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,291
But gosh, you heard!

385
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,875
[PICCOLO] Don't worry, Goku.

386
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,291
I won't say anything that
would endanger your friend.

387
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,166
But we deserve a chance
to change our destinies!

388
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,958
All of us, not just him!

389
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,416
[BULMA] "Destinies"...?

390
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,500
[PICCOLO] ...And that's
the whole story.

391
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,041
In three years,
all of us except Gohan

392
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,583
are supposed to die in a
battle with the androids.

393
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,041
But now that we know,
maybe we can change that.

394
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,125
What a kook! He's cracked!
Don't you think?

395
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm not so sure.

396
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,666
Look, believe what
you want to believe.

397
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,375
As for me, I want to live.
So I'm going to train.

398
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,875
Huh?

399
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,958
[PICCOLO] You can risk it,
but I'm going to be prepared.

400
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,666
[YAMCHA] Look! There he is!

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,875
Father! You're so
tough and proud!

402
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,666
Hard and cold like a rock!

403
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,750
But still, deep down, your
heart beats like mine does...

404
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:53,541
I know you feel! I'm your son,
and I will always love you!

405
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm glad I got
to see you, Dad...

406
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,625
Farewell, young Mother! May the
good spirits keep you safe!

407
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,083
He's gone.

408
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,666
[PICCOLO] Yeah,
back to the future...

409
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,208
[BULMA} How strange.

410
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,500
I could have sworn he was
waving goodbye... to me...

411
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,041
Man, I'm going
to train, you guys.

412
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,458
Me too.

413
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,333
Yeah, I am, too.

414
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:28,083
[thinking] Another Super Saiyan!
Rrrgh! I've got to have it!

415
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,416
I've got to experience it!

416
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,333
[thinking] Gosh... Goodbye,
whoever you are...

417
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,583
[GOHAN] Wow! Gosh, Dad!

418
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,458
Do you really believe that
that guy came from the future?

419
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,166
[GOKU] Yes, I do,
Son! Yes, I do...

420
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,375
[NARRATOR] As the young Super
Saiyan named Trunks

421
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,666
heads down stream
in the river of time,

422
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,583
Goku and the others consider
the fantastic prophecies

423
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,791
that he left behind

424
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,916
On the next Dragon Ball Z!
