[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,333
a stranger from the future
arrived to inform

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,583
Goku and the others they
had three years to prepare

4
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,333
for the arrival of
two evil androids,

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,166
androids more powerful
than any enemy

[TRUNKS] Once
this pair surfaces,

the Earth and everything you
know will be gone for good.

[NARRATOR] Heeding
the advice of Trunks,

10
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,916
our heroes stepped up
their training.

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,333
Vegeta is training
like never before.

12
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,583
And he won't stop until he's
become a Super Saiyan

13
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,833
even if it kills him.

this ominous message

16
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,375
from the future lightly,
and neither is Goku!

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,583
Together, they're
training night and day

18
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,083
in the hope that
they will be ready to

19

meet head on whatever
challenges might lie ahead.

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,583
[NARRATOR] Gohan is growing
stronger by the day as well.

21
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,333
Pretty soon, he may even be able
to teach his dad a thing or two

22

I'll be! It's him!
It's Master Roshi!

Except his nose is a bit bigger.

looks like Piccolo.

Now, let me get this straight:

79
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,541
You expect me to get dinner
ready and wash your clothes

80
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,958
while you and Gohan relax
in a nice hot bath?!

81

Well that's not going
to happen mister!

82
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,666
Do you even care what
kind of day I've had?!

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,208
I don't know what
I liked better:

84
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,416
being chased half way
home by a wild boar,

85
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,000
or walking the rest of the
way on my tired, aching feet!

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
And it's all because
we don't have a car!

87
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,000
Uh, ChiChi, I'd drive
you if I could.

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,416
But you know I don't have
a driver's license yet.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,416
Well, it's time you got one!

90
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,208
I don't know why you have to
be the only man in this town

91
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,208
who doesn't have a
driver's license or a car!

You can't drive can you?

LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS!

94
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,583
I want both of you to put
your training on hold for now

95
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,000
and go to driving
school tomorrow!

96
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,583
I think it's about
time the two of you

learned something
useful for a change.

do we have too?

Listen, all I'm
asking you two to do

101
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
is get your driver's license.

102

It's not like I'm asking
you to save the world.

And if you don't...

you'll have to cook your
own meals from now on!

00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,583
[BOTH gasp]

323
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,750
[BOTH sigh]

324
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:36,583
[CHILDREN cheer, giggle]

325
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,791
[GOKU] Goodbye, kids! Take care!

326
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:44,666
I'm sorry, sir! I guess we
didn't get to finish the test!

327
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,916
And I turned your new
convertible into a compact.

328
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,166
What a disaster...

329
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,166
Hey! Don't sweat it!

330
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,458
You mean you're not going to
totally freak out or something?

331
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:59,500
No way! Not after witnessing
that terrific rescue!

332
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:04,625
Oh? Does that mean I might
still get my driver's license?

333
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,708
Not a chance! You're a danger
to everyone else on the road!

334
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,125
[PICCOLO] What about me?

335
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,541
Nope!

336
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,041
Then we both failed?

337
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,083
[MALE INSTRUCTOR laughs]

338
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,458
Neither of you passed,
but so what?

339
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:22,541
I'd trade my driver's license
in a second for a chance to fly!

340
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,833
So would I!

341
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,750
--[PICCOLO gasps]
--[FEMALE INSTRUCTOR laughs]

342
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
[thinking] What's
ChiChi going to say?

343
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,916
[CHICHI] Failed the test?! What
do you mean you failed the test?

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,083
You're telling me neither of you
muscle heads got your license?!

345
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,083
Uh, yeah...

346
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,541
Mm-hmm...

347
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,583
Mom?!

348
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,500
Was it something I said?!

349
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,333
[NARRATOR] In no time, three
years have come and gone.

350
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,125
[CHICHI] Promise me that you'll
all take care of each other.

351
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,416
How about a little
lunch before you go?

352
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,458
Mom, we don't
have time for that!

353
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,333
Thanks! Bye!

354
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's do it!

355
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,083
[NARRATOR] The time has come
for Goku and the others to unite

356
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,125
and face the two killer androids

357
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,125
that Trunks warned them
about three years ago!

358
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,041
[TRUNKS] Only you can change
the course of the future now.

359
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,583
Please stop them!

360
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,333
You've got to destroy
the androids

361
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,291
that Dr. Gero will create.

362
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,458
The future of this
planet is at stake.

363
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,583
You and your friends must
change the path of the future.

364
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,375
You are the last chance!
Please stop them!

365
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,333
Ready or not, Goku and the
others have a date with destiny!

366
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,666
A destiny that depends
on them defeating an enemy

367
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,541
more powerful than any
they have ever faced before!

368
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,333
It should be a piece of cake!

369
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,583
on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
