[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,208
in a rash attempt
to save the Earth,

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,291
Piccolo destroyed the doorway
to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

4
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,333
trapping himself,
Gotenks, and Majin Buu

5
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,791
inside another dimension.

[MAJIN BUU]
Let me out!

7
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,958
[NARRATOR]
But in a screaming rage,

8
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,041
Majin Buu accidentally
ripped a hole

9
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,583
in the fabric of space itself,

10
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,375
using the powerful
vibration of his voice.

11
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,000
[MAJIN BUU] I knew
I could have my candy!

12
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,250
[NARRATOR] Fueled by
his monstrous appetite,

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,625
Majin Buu went to
great lengths to escape.

14
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,166
Leaving Gotenks and Piccolo

15
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,125
as the victims of
the Namek's own trap.

16
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,708
[NARRATOR] And the friends
and family atop the Lookout

17
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,208
were left without
any protection.

18
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,041
[YAMCHA]
Ah! What do we do now?

19
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,166
[NARRATOR] With nothing left
for the Z Fighters to do

20
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,625
but watch in terror,

21
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,333
Majin Buu laid waste to them

22
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,208
in the exact way he had
done the entire world!

23

revealed a surprise ability

26
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,000
he had foolishly
hidden during the fight--

27

Super Saiyan 3!

28
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,375
And ripping a
dimensional hole of his own,

29
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,375
Gotenks and Piccolo returned
to the ruined Lookout.

34
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,916
[NARRATOR] With only
Gotenks and Piccolo left,

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,958
has Majin Buu cleared
the way for victory?

36
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,750

Uh, excuse me, but
what exactly's going on?

73
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,958
Not too long ago,
I ascended to level three,

and let me tell you, it's not
the easiest thing to control.

might possibly be greater.

00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:01,500
Hey! Is there
anybody out there?

164
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:06,458
Anybody at all?!
This is Mr. Satan!

165
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,833
You know, the World
Martial Arts champion

166
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,583
and savior of the world!

167
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,083
Auh! It's no use.
They're all dead.

168
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,708
--[MR. SATAN] Uuh...
--[BEE whines]

169
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,000
[thinking] How did that
guy ever get so mean.

170
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,791
[thinking] The three of us
got along like family.

171
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,916
[panting]

172
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,416
[BEE barking]

173
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,791
[BEE barks]

174
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,916
[MR. SATAN sighs]

175
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,958
I know Bee. I miss him, too.

176
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,666
[MR. SATAN thinking]
You finally did it, Buu.

177
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,375
Just like you wanted
from the start.

178
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,500
You put an end to humanity.

179
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,083
[chuckles]

180
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,583
Aah! All gone! All gone!

181
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:56,541
[grunting]

182
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,166
Hey, Piccolo?
What's this guy tryin' to do?

183
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,541
[SUPER BUU laughs intensely]

184
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,166
Uh, he's starting to
look like a cannonball.

185
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
What did you do?

186
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,958
[SUPER BUU chuckles, yells]

187
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,541
Whoa! Hey, Piccolo, heads up!

188
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,708
[SUPER BUU laughing]

189
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,666
[yells]

190
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,458
[GOTENKS, PICCOLO] Aah!

191
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,916
Aah!

192
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,708
If he keeps this up,
the Lookout will be history.

193
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,541
[thinking] He could at
least let me take a look.

194
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,625
[grunting]

195
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,083
Gotenks, hit him before
he comes back around!

196
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,083
Yeah, I'll get him.

197
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,041
[yells]
A screaming ban--

198
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,750
[GOTENKS, PICCOLO groan]

199
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,125
A screaming banshee attack!

200
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,541
What are you doing?

201
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,708
Stop yelling and just
attack him before he kills us!

202
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,458
But, that's a little
boring, don't you think?

203
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,750
Isn't it, Piccolo?

204
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,791
Fine, have it your way.

205
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,375
Hold on to your socks,
Majin Buu. Uh!

206
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,750
[SUPER BUU groans]

207
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,458
[chuckles]
He looks kinda surprised.

208
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
[PICCOLO] That's the way
you were trained, Gotenks!

209
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,958
Nice move!

210
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,333
Thanks a lot, but he'll be
able to get out of here soon.

211
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:57,166
So, we should do something
else to finish him off.

212
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,416
Uh...

213
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,291
Which move should I use?

214
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,958
[growls lowly]

215
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,750
I got it! I'll do a
Spiking Buu-ball Slam!

216
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,291
[PICCOLO] What the heck
does that mean?

217
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,041
[GOTENKS] It's a new move,
fresh off the presses.

218
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,833
You wanna help?

219
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,375
[chuckles]

220
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,291
[GOTENKS] All right,
are you ready, Piccolo?

221
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,500
Come on, if we're going
to work as a team,

222
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,375
I need you to answer me
when I ask you a question.

223
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,208
--Do you see what I'm saying?
--Aah!

224
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,291
You taught me to be
a team player, Piccolo,

225
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,458
and right now
I need you to help me.

226
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,125
Believe me,
if there's any way

227
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,666
I thought I could
do this on my own,

228
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,208
I wouldn't be asking you.

229
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, let's hurry! We don't
have a lot of time left!

230
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,500
Yes, I know that.

231
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,125
Are you ready?!

232
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,083
Just hurry!

233
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,000
[PICCOLO grunts]

234
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,333
[yells]

235
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,833
Spiking Buu-ball Slam!

236
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,083
[chuckles]

237
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,416
[thinking] Why does
the strongest fighter left

238
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,125
have to be so darn ridiculous?

239
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
Oh-ho!

240
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,833
[GOTENKS]
Oh yeah!

241
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,083
[GOTENKS chuckles]

242
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, would you
get a load of that?

243
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,333
I've heard of meteorites
hitting the ground

244
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,000
that made smaller
craters than this.

245
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,458
Majin Buu must've been moving
pretty fast when he hit!

246
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,166
Hey! Down here!

247
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,625
Not too shabby, huh?
We make a good team.

248
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,458
Stay focused, Gotenks!

249
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,666
We're not done yet.

250
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,291
Are you sure?

251
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,458
Yeah! Now that's what I
call a slam-bang finish.

252
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,458
Wait, don't celebrate yet!

253
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,583
I'm sensing some
kind of disturbance.

254
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,041
Some great uprising power.

255
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,750
[GOTENKS] Hello! I know
you're still there, Majin Buu.

256
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,291
Come on! I've only got
five more minutes,

257
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,625
then we'll have to
wait an hour

258
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,750
until I can do Fusion again!

259
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,083
You'd be smart
to show your face.

260
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,333
Here I am about to
lose all of my powers

261
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,625
and be helpless to
defend myself! Really!

262
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,250
It's just poor
little Gotenks here,

263
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,000
all by his lonesome,
unable to fight back at all.

264
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,500
Can you hear me, Buu?!

265
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,125
Huh. I wonder
if he really died.

266
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,000
[laughs]

267
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,708
Just my luck.

268
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:09,375
I finally beat Majin Buu and
there's no one here to see it.

269
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,416
[BOTH gasp]

270
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,125
[PICCOLO]
Get back!

271
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,208
[yells]

272
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,333
[BOTH yell]

273
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,666
[NARRATOR] With a devastating
display of power,

274
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,333
Majin Buu has again
emerged from the rubble

275
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,583
to continue his destruction
of the planet Earth!

276
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,083
[NARRATOR]
Although Gotenks continues

277
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,083
to prove his worth as a warrior,

278
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,666
his strength is matched
by Buu's endurance.

279
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,625
Will Majin Buu
be able to hold on

280
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,916
until Gotenks
is no longer fused?

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,375
Stay tuned for more of the
excitement on Dragon Ball Z!
