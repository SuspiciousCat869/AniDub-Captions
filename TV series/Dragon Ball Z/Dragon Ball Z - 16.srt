00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,791
the race was on to get
into fighting shape

3
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,916
before the two uninvited
Saiyan warriors

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,333
make their
appearance on Earth...

5
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,416
And everyone,
even Piccolo,

6
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,291
is training twice
as hard as ever.

7
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,250
Not only is it a
battle against time,

8
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,375
it's a battle
against themselves...

9
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,875
But an
unexpected storm

10
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,541
has threatened to put an end
to Gohan's training plans...

11
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,875
All alone and
lost at sea,

12
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,416
Gohan is surely in for the
fight of his young life...

13
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,291
That is, if
he survives...

14
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,166
[GIRL] Who is he?

15
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,833
He doesn't look like
he's from around here.

16
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,083
[BOY] I dunno...

17
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,291
He must have fallen off
a ship or something...

18
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,500
[GIRL] Well, don't get too
close, he could be dangerous!

19
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,125
[BOY] He won't wake up!

20
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,791
Is he alive?

21
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,166
[BOY] I'd better check!

22
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,833
I guess not.
Too bad.

23
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,125
[GIRL] Oh no...

24
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,833
How can you tell, Rom?
What did you do?

25
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,208
The old ear test!

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,500
You mean you're
six years old

27
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,791
and you haven't heard
of the ear test before?

28
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,666
Yes I have!

29
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,000
[ROM] Hmm. It doesn't look like
he has anything valuable on him.

30
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey, look, Rom!
What's that?

31
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,625
Huh?

32
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,750
[ROM] Oh, wow! A sword!

33
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,083
Cool!
Check it out!

34
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,958
Hey...
That's my sword...

35
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,083
I guess he's
dead again.

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,583
Keep it on, Rom!
He's waking up!

37
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,041
[ROM] Is he?

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,166
[ROM] You're right! Hello there!

39
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,416
Hi.

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,083
[ROM] How's it going?
I'm Rom!

41
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,416
And my name
is Chiko! Hi!

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,750
Hi. Where am I?

43
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,625
Here!

44
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,916
Where's here?

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,291
Here is wherever we
happen to be at the time.

46
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,708
Oh, cool...

47
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,458
[ROM] It's great, isn't it?
This is our house.

48
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,166
It's free because no
one wants it...

49
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,375
Where'd you
come from anyway?

50
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,458
I don't know... I think it
was a desert or something.

51
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,041
[CHIKO] Oh, wow. I can't
believe you're all alone!

52
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,541
Not anymore!

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,375
From now on you can hang out
with us! We're orphans too!

54
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,500
What?

55
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,875
[ROM] We only have
one rule, never cry.

56
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,375
But Chiko breaks that rule all
the time, so don't worry...

57
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,416
I do not!

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,083
I'm Gohan.

59
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,625
It's nice to
meet you, Gohan.

60
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,250
Don't believe everything that
Rom tells you though, okay?

61
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,208
Y'know, You're the
first new orphan ever.

62
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,166
The rest of us have been
together since the tidal wave!

63
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,000
Say whatever's on
your mind, Gohan.

64
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,208
We speak freely
around this place.

65
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,416
That's good!

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,833
It's just that I've been
alone for so long...

67
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,083
I forgot how to talk.

68
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,375
Huh? Huh...

69
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,833
[ROM] There was a huge tidal
wave about two years ago...

70
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,041
Boy, when it hit,
it wiped out the whole town!

71
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,875
It was so scary!

72
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,958
[ROM] That why there's
a lot of kids around here

73
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,875
without families
or homes to go to.

74
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,750
[WORKER 1] That's the place,
right up ahead there!

75
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,583
Um? I'm not a...

76
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,333
[shrill whistle blowing]

77
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,750
It's the goon squad!
Let's go!

78
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,208
Right!

79
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,041
What's up?

80
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,791
Gohan! Let's go!

81
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,250
[CHIKO] C'mon!

82
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,625
Right!

83
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,916
[ROM] C'mon, Gohan!
You're gonna get caught!

84
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,166
They're not
back there! Hm?

85
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,625
[WORKER 1] C'mon!

86
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get Chiko across!

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,458
[ROM] Uh-oh...
He's a goner.

88
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,208
[GOHAN shouting]

89
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,833
[WORKER 2] Give it up, kid!
There's nowhere to go!

90
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,125
[WORKER 2] You're
coming with us!

91
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,583
Oh!

92
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,083
Hey!

93
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,833
[BOTH] Wooaah!

94
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,375
Take that!
You big apes!

95
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,916
[makes ape noises]

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,083
[WORKER 2] Grr! Those
little brats! C'mon!

97
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,208
[GOHAN] Huh?
Uh, who are those guys?

98
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,625
[ROM] They're from
the home, where kids

99
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,458
get spanked and yelled at!

100
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,125
They put us in a pen
if we're caught,

101
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,250
and they'll treat
us like animals!

102
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,416
Sounds terrible!

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,458
If they get you,
there's no escape.

104
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,375
You'll have to spend
the rest of your days

105
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,125
working for 'em doing
chores in the home!

106
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:23,250
Well, not me! I'll hide
from them... I will!

107
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,375
They've found us now...
They'll come back!

108
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,000
[CHICO crying]

109
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,750
[screaming]

110
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,750
[CHICO] Oh no...

111
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,625
[WORKER 3] Be quiet!
Come on!

112
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,625
[GIRL] Noo! Aahh!

113
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,083
Huh?!

114
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,958
[WORKER 3] Why,
you little brat!

115

Pigero!

116
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,291
That's enough outta you
clowns! The girl stays!

117
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,250
That's what
you think!

118
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,833
Chyeaah!

119
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,166
Yaahh!

120
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,291
Haah!

121
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:30,416
[children yelling, laughing]

122
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,541
That's enough now!

123
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,375
We're not here to
hurt you children!

124
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,833
We just want to
take you to a place

125
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,125
where you can
have new clothes,

126
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,500
and hot meals and a
bed to sleep in.

127
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,375
Hear that?

128
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,166
C'mon, she's
lying, dummy!

129
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,041
[PIGERO] We don't want all of
that stuff! Just leave!

130
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,166
[SOCIAL WORKER] What about the
other children? The small ones!

131
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,166
Maybe some of them want
a home to live in?

132
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,833
[PIGERO] We all had homes
before the tidal wave hit!

133
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,875
If you really want to give
us nice things, that's fine!

134
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
Just bring 'em over here.

00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,833
Is he new?

142
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,416
Yeah, he is. He was shipwrecked
and we found him on the beach.

143
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,041
Hi, I'm Gohan!
Nice to meet you!

144
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,875
And since he's the smallest,
he gets food everyday now!

145
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,875
Nope! You're still
the smallest, Chiko.

147

It's nice to meet you.

You can take him!

I've got the freshest

00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:23,916
[screaming]

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,375
[GROCER] Curses!

164
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,500
[MAN] They went
that way!

165
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,916
[ROM yelling]

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,833
[MOLE] Faster,
Rom! Faster!

167
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
[POLICE CHIEF] Stop,
you thieves!

168
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,750
[POLICE CHIEF] I
said stop!

169
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,958
[POLICE CHIEF growling]

170
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,333
[GIRL] Oh my!

171
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,541
Oh yeah!

172
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,958
I'll get you
kids for this!

173
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,958
That was fun,
wasn't it?

174
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,333
Yeah!

175
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,708
Who needs parents?
We sure don't!

176
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,750
You bet!

177
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,250
We do just fine!

178
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,625
We're a
family now!

179
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,583
Isn't that
great?

180
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,250
Yeah, sure.

181
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,208
[thinking] I remember that tidal
wave like it happened yesterday.

182
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,958
[PIGERO] Hey, Gohan!
What's up?

183
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,625
Hey, what are you
doing up so late?

184
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm on guard!

185
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,916
Sometimes the workers from
the home come at night.

186
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,250
I do night duty ever
since Rom nodded off

187
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,041
and fell out
of the tree.

188
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,500
[PIGERO] So what's
up with you?

189
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,291
You must have something on your
mind if you're up this late.

190
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,250
Well, I'm not
really an orphan.

191
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,208
When I was shipwrecked, I was
on my way home to see my mom.

192
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,000
Hmm. I see.

193
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,250
[ROM] Oh, so you
do have a home?

194
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,916
Sorry, you guys.
I just couldn't say it.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,125
Hey, don't worry
about it, it's cool.

196
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,416
[ROM] Yeah, I really didn't
give you the chance to tell us.

197
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,041
So, where is
your house?

198
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,416
Uh, it's right by Mt.
Paoz in the forest.

199
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,416
Hey, that's just a little
ways inland from here.

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,416
Wow! Seriously?

201
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,708
Uh-huh...

202
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,625
Hey, if you know where it
is, can you show me?

203
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,250
No problem, I'll take
you over there tomorrow.

204
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,750
Man! Thank you!

205
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,500
Hey, so what's your
mom like, Gohan?

206
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,958
Well, she's sweet
and she's pretty,

207
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,375
but she's really into
making me study a lot.

208
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,375
I guess I could
study if I had to.

209
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,583
No way!
Not me!

210
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,208
Oh, it's not
that bad!

211
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,250
You get to
play some.

212
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,750
Oh, wow,
really?

213
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,375
Yeah, not enough, though.
But it's better than nothing!

214
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, all of
these big cities

215
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,416
are only a
hundred years old.

216
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Before that, kid's didn't
even have to go to school,

217
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,875
they just worked
on a farm.

218
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,000
Wow, cool!

219
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,208
Yeah!

220
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,916
Yeah, lots of people
never went to school!

221
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,333
That must
have been cool.

222
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,708
To just live on the land before
all this junk was built.

223
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,541
I hear ya... We could've
done things differently.

224
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,291
What would we
do differently?

225
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,708
[PIGERO] Well, for starters,
we'd set aside

226
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,250
a beautiful place
for orphans.

227
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,875
Yeah, and we wouldn't be too
busy to spend time with them!

228
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,375
No cars and
highways! Nope!

229
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,000
Except ice cream trucks,
those are okay!

230
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,750
[laughing]

231
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,791
Hey, what do you say we
all drive to Gohan's house

232
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,125
tomorrow and
drop him off!

233
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,291
Yay! That's great!

234
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,083
[YUDON] But how are
we gonna do that?

235
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,333
[children murmuring]

236
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,250
[PIGERO] I have
a plan! Listen up.

237
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,458
No sign?

238
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,500
[MOLE] Not yet!

239
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,958
They're late today.

240
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,666
[ROM] Maybe they've
finally given up...

241
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,125
Huh?

242
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,875
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Hey! Here they come!

243
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,791
[PIGARO] Places everybody!

244
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,500
Ahhh!

245
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,208
[screaming]

246
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,875
[PIGERO]
Sorry!

247
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,333
[whistles]

248
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,708
[PIGERO]
Hurry up!

249
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,708
Police!

250
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:35,958
Scramble!

251
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,416
Huh?

252
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,833
[POLICEMAN] Alright, kids,
it's over!

253
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,791
[children whimpering]

254
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,291
[CHIKO yelling]

255
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,375
Chiko?
Huh?

256
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,291
Now what, hotshot?

257
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,291
[GOHAN] Haah!

258
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,750
[GOHAN] Haah!

259
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,416
[orphans voices]
Pigero, you're our hero!

260
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,583
[social worker's voice]
What about the other children?

261
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,125
Maybe some of them would
like a home to live in!

262
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,458
Come on!
Let's go!

263
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,166
But, the others!

264
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,666
Never mind!

265
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,125
[ROM] Noo!

266
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:43,791
Come back!

267
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,250
Pigero!

268
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,458
[yelling]

269
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,833
[ROM] Pigero!

270
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,666
[GOHAN] Hey, Pigero! Why!
Why did you leave them?

271
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,083
You were their
hero! Why?

272
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,208
[PIGERO] You don't understand!
I didn't have a choice!

273
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,791
I can't take
care of them!

274
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,708
They need more than
I can give 'em!

275
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,875
Those kids need
a real home!

276
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,666
Later! You're one bad dude,
for real. Keep it up!

277
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,166
[GOHAN] Where
will you go?

278
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,083
[PIGERO[ I don't know!
There's a whole world out there!

279
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,833
Take care of
that mom of yours!

280
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,208
See ya!

281
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,166
[GOHAN] Thank you, Pigero!
I hope we meet again someday!

282
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,166
[GOHAN] Home! Here I come!

283
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,291
[GOHAN laughing]

284
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,958
[GOHAN] Mom...

285
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,166
So what's your
Mom like, Gohan?

286
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,083
I think it's great
that you have a home!

287
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,958
Keep it up, huh?

288
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,500
There's a whole
world out there!

289
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,916
Gohan... What
is your mission?

290
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,875
Say it!

291
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,666
To prepare for the Saiyans!
To fight!

292
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,583
And to beat them!

293
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,291
Then let's go back!

294
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,666
Right!

295
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,625
[NARRATOR]
That's the way, Gohan!

296
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,625
This isn't the time
for a family reunion

297
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,416
because danger is
approaching fast!

298
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,791
The two Saiyans
are getting close

299
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,500
and you have
to be ready.

300
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,458
There's no telling
what kind of damage

301
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,666
they will inflict
on the Earth.

302
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,958
And if you at home
want to find out,

303
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:55,291
don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
