00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,250
the beauty of Mother
Earth was overtaken

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
by the Black Water Mist.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,916
A fog of evil that was
released from Kami's Lookout

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,125
by Garlic Jr., who had turned
the once magnificent sanctuary

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,125
into a den of corruption!

7
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,375
[NARRATOR] As Garlic Jr.
swore an oath of darkness

8
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,666
to use the Dragon Balls
to restore his father,

9
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,208
Garlic, back to life,

10
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,125
the Black Water Mist
continued to spread below

11
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,708
and exercise
it's mysterious power

12
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,333
over all who breathed it!

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,041
Sweet, timid animals became
ravenous and blood-thirsty.

14
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,250
[NARRATOR] Ordinary
housewives were turned into

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,250
murderous fiends!

16
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,416
[NARRATOR] Even Goku's friends,
defenders of the earth

17
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,041
and upholders of justice,
were transformed into

18
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,708
minions of evil
by the dreadful mist!

19
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,833
But there was
more trouble on the way.

20
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,541
The Spice Boys had arrived.

21
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,583
And they meant business.

22
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,958
Oh, great! Who are those goons?

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,166
[NARRATOR] Gohan went for
the head-on attack

24
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,291
only to be stopped in his tracks
by Garlic Jr.'s evil henchmen,

25
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:28,625
Spice, Vinegar,
Mustard, and Salt!

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,041
Piccolo.

27
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,500
[NARRATOR] But just as Gohan
seemed to be done for,

28
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,750
his Namekian ally
came to te rescue.

29
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,500
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

30
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,250
[KRILLIN] All right!

31
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,083
Good. Yeah, this'll be fun!

32
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,833
[SALT] Garlic Jr. can
destroy you anytime, Piccolo!

33
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,708
He has Kami
held captive, you fool!

34
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,208
What? Garlic Jr.'s back?

35
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,083
[NARRATOR] And so
Piccolo was surrounded

36
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,875
by an army of
darkness made up of

37
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,791
friends and foes alike.

38
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,583
What happens next? Stay tuned!

39
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
[SPICE] Admit it! You've
always had a fascination

40
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,416
with the dark side, Piccolo.

41
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,291
Why don't you join Garlic Jr.
now, while you still can?

42
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,583
He's about to
take over the planet.

43
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,500
Yeah, right.
Don't make me laugh.

44
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,750
C'mon! How can
someone stupid enough

45
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,416
to get caught in his own trap
take over a planet, friend?

46
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,958
[MUSTARD]
Hey! Watch your mouth!

47
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,166
[SALT] You're going to wish you
never said that, lizard boy!

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,625
Yikes! Get ready, Gohan!

49
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,375
[KRILLIN] We're gonna
have to move in fast!

50
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,208
Are you nuts?

51
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,166
You can't leave me
here by myself!

52
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,500
You're supposed to protect me
from danger, Krillin!

53
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,500
No! Please! Don't go!

54
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,291
Hush up, Maron!

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,791
[VINEGAR] You're lucky that
Lord Garlic ordered us

56
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,083
to take you in alive, or I'd
finish you off right now!

57
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,250
How did your brainless boss
escape the Dead Zone?

58
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,041
All right, that's it!
You're dead!

59
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,125
Hey...

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,250
[chuckles]

61
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,416
Settle down, Vinegar.

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
[SPICE] He's just trying
to get you riled up.

63
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,708
[SPICE] I'll answer
your question, Piccolo,

64
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,791
if you really want to know.

65
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,083
The power of the Makyo Star.

66
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,916
Go on. How?

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,875
Ah, yes! Now I have
your attention.

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,041
Not long ago
the autumnal equinox was

69
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,416
[SPICE] on the first
point of Libra.

70
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,791
Heralding this auspicious
moment for the dark side

71
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,541
was the Makyo Star,

72
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,458
whose proximity
to the earth provided

73
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,750
an incredible source of power
to all creatures of the night.

74
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,083
This rare alignment
of the planets and stars

75
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,208
occurs only once
every 12,000 years.

76
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,291
At no other time
is man more susceptible

77
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,000
to evil than this.

78
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,000
It is a time when
the powers of darkness

79
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,291
are at their zenith,

80
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,125
and the unseen lower
forces dominate the earth.

81
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,916
Garlic Jr. used this
influx of dark energy

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,041
as a springboard
to shatter his prison

83
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,791
and escape it forever.

84
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:13,291
[chuckles]

85
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,875
[SPICE]
You don't get it, do you?

86
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,500
Garlic Jr. is the new
guardian of the earth.

87
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,541
He's taken over Kami's
Lookout and is seated

88
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,416
quite comfortably on the throne.

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,958
Kami and Popo are
just mantle pieces now,

90
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,125
looking on helplessly
from the little glass jars.

91
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,416
Huh?!

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,083
Great! We're in trouble!

93
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,916
[SPICE] The beautiful part
about it all is that with

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,208
the Black Water Mist, we hardly
have to raise a finger.

95
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,000
Just look how eager
your friends are to help us.

96
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,208
We're gods to these plebeians!

97
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,666
We're like celebrities
to all these people!

98
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,500
Kinda like their
role models and all!

99
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,583
Yeah! Dig it, man!
You should join us.

100
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,291
You would love it.
They worship us!

101
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,541
And soon they're gonna
be like that for good!

102
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,625
--[GOHAN] Huh?
--[KRILLIN] What? For good?

103
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,750
Once twenty-four
hours passes by,

104
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,625
the change becomes permanent!

105
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,666
Not even the Sacred Water
can change them back!

106
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,708
[chuckles]

107
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,625
You came here
looking to fight us,

108
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,083
but the battle
has already been won.

109
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,875
There's no one left
to fight for.

110
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,791
Nobody wants your help.
Can't you understand that?

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,666
Just look!
Look at your friends!

112
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,125
[SPICE] Do they look like
they're waiting for

113
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,708
a knight in shining armor
to come and rescue them?

114
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,958
[SPICE] Who do you think
you're fooling, anyway?

115
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,916
You haven't really changed.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So drop the goody-two-shoes act
and join us. Or, oppose us...

117
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,583
...and suffer like you've
never suffered before.

118
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,666
Your choice.

119
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,208
Well?

120
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:52,125
[chuckles]

121
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,583
Huh?

122
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,875
Why you louse!

123
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,541
So that's your choice.

124
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,458
That's it! I've had
enough of this, jerk!

125
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,500
[VINEGAR]
You're gonna get it now!

126
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
Well, we'll see.

127
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,583
[VINEGAR chuckles]

128
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,625
Man! If that
was your best shot,

129
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,166
you're in big trouble,
my friend!

130
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,125
[PICCOLO groans]

131
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,750
[chuckles]

132
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,666
Yamcha! Stop it!

133
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,916
Stop it, guys! Yamcha!

134
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, what's the deal, Krillin?

135
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,750
You said you were an expert!

136
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,750
You can't even beat
an old man! Some expert!

137
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,250
But, he's better than he looks!

138
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,541
[yells]

139
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,708
Oh, man! Krillin?

140
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,875
[MARON screams]

141
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
Now what?

142
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,000
[chuckles]

143
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,666
[MARON] Forget this!

144
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,833
[MARON yelps]

145
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:25,458
No! And I thought I'd been
to weird beach parties before!

146
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,708
Darling!

147
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,708
[ROSHI] Yes, honey?

148
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,750
[laughs]

149
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,458
[MARON] Krillin! Help me!

150
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,250
[yells]

151
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,458
[yells]

152
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,500
[screams]

153
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,416
Maron! No!

154
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,625
All right! You rule, Icarus!

155
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,916
[KRILLIN] Take good
care of her, okay?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,958
Krillin!

157
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,000
Look! He can't even
keep up with his friends,

158
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,750
nevermind us!

159
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,416
Don't Piccolo, please!

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,583
Move it!

161
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,541
[screeches]

00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,541
Oh my gosh!

163
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,583
Tell me what to do! Hurry!

164
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,208
All right!
You take off! Now! Got it?

165
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,208
Huh?

166
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,833
The whole planet's
been infected,

167
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,583
just like Yamcha and your mom!

168
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,708
You need to get
the Sacred Water!

169
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,166
Yeah! But you...

170
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,083
Hey! He knows
what he's doing, Gohan!

171
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,916
Leave! Get the water!

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,833
But be careful--
Garlic Jr.'s going to be

173
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,500
up there guarding it!

174
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,916
[chuckles]

175
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,458
Do it!

176
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,166
Right! We'll be back!

177
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,500
[PICCOLO] The Yamcha I know
would tear you apart!

178
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,791
[PICCOLO] I'm sorry,
but you leave me no choice.

179
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,041
I'm going to have
to exterminate you all!

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I hate to do this.

181
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,791
[grunts]
It's not your fault.

182
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,708
[PICCOLO] Huh? What?

183
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,375

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,250
Huh? Piccolo!

187
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:53,583
[groans]

Oh, my goodness!

191
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,666
[PICCOLO] Gohan, no!

192
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,125
[grunts, yells]

193
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,500
[PICCOLO] Gohan...

194
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,041
Do as I said! Now!

195
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,458
[GOHAN]
I won't leave you, Piccolo!

196
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:40,166
Gohan...! Now!

197
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,958
That runt! Should I?

198
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,791
No, stay.

199
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,458
I'm sure that he's
after the Sacred Water.

200
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,250
He won't get far.

201
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,125
Yeah, that's it. Go, kid.

202
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,583
[YAMCHA yells]

[BOTH chuckle lightly]

205
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,291
Must... hold on...

206
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,333
[groans]

207
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,500
Hey!

208
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,833
[GOHAN] Huh? Krillin!

209
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,708
Yeah! Let's rock!

210
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,166
Right!

211
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,125
[MARON] Hey Krillin!

212
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,875
Huh? Auh...

213
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,500
Wait up! I'm coming with you!

214
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,166
Oh no you're not!

215
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,958
Maron, this is serious!

216
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,083
You'd be in real danger!

217
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,000
So what? I don't care!
I'm still coming!

218
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,791
Huh?

219
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,625
Good! Case closed!

220
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,708
Where are we going, guys? Huh?

221
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,000
Maron. That's very
brave of you,

222
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,416
but this is no
place for a girl.

223
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
All right. But if you
make me leave now,

224
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,291
then I'm not gonna be
your girlfriend anymore!

225
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,708
You're not?

226
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:17,291
That's right! Forget it!
It's all over!

227
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,375
Unless I can
come with you! Hmph!

228
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,333
[MARON] Well?

229
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,791
Oh, man!

230
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,916
Oh... all right. I guess!

231
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,250
Huh? Yay!

232
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,750
If things heat up,
take a B-line outta there.

233
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,375
[giggles]

234
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,125
You are such a stud! Mwah!

235
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,250
[sighs]

236
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:54,916
[GARLIC JR.] Yes, yes. Come to
me, Gohan. I'm waiting!

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,125
[chuckles]

238
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,666
[SPICE]
His Namek body is having

239
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,208
a strong reaction to the venom.

240
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,125
Too bad. Let's put him
out of his misery.

241
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,416
Vinegar, stop.

242
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,333
Huh?

243
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,166
We mustn't kill poor Piccolo.

244
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,083
Without him, we won't be able
to use the Dragon Balls.

245
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,958
[VINEGAR] Do I get to
kill him later then?

246
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,500
'Fraid not.

247
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,958
Huh?

248
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,083
Why should we hurt a friend?

249
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,375
If you're bitten
by someone who's been

250
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,166
[SPICE] infected by
the Black Water Mist,

251
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
you become just like them.

252
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,916
[laughs wheezingly]

253
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,916
[SPICE]
Piccolo's one of us.

254
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,500
Yes. Wake up.
You're part of the family now.

255
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,250
[snarls]

256
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:11,875
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere...
deep in space...

257
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,583
a certain Saiyan Prince
has been a most

258
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,250
unwelcome guest
on a strange planet!

259
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,500
My word! So this is
what my people get

260
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,750
for being loyal
servants to Frieza?

261
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,250
How could he order
Vegeta to do this to us

262
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,625
[WARRIOR]
after all we've done for him?

263
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,083
[VEGETA] Fool! No one
tells me what to do anymore!

264
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,708
Especially Frieza!

265
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,250
[WARRIOR]
You dare to defy Frieza?

266
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,166
Look! I did not come here
to fight with you!

267
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,708
It was you and your
idiotic friends

268
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,375
that started it
in the first place.

269
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,333
Now tell me where Goku is!

270
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,208
I've never even heard of him!

271
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,041
[VEGETA] If you're lying to me,
I will rip your head off!

272
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,583
Heh! We're protected
under Frieza's treaty.

273
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,083
You're the one
who's going to get it.

274
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,375
Really? Is that so?

275
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,583
[yells]

276
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,708
The treaty you signed with
Frieza is no longer valid.

277
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,541
Because in order for
a treaty to exist,

278
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,500
the one who signed it must
be alive, and Frieza's dead!

279
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,916
A Saiyan by the name of
Goku destroyed him.

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,208
Frieza killed by a...
a monkey! What a joke!

281
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,458
[chuckles]

282
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't remember
telling a joke, bird-face!

283
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,375
Aah...!

284
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,875
[VEGETA] You just made my day!

285
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,541
[grunts]

286
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,333
[VEGETA] I don't know
where you are, Kakarot,

287
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,666
but I am going to find you!

288
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,166
You're around here somewhere.
I can feel it!

289
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,750
I have to know
how you did it, Kakarot!

290
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,666
I need to be a Super Saiyan!

291
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,583
[KRILLIN] Gosh! I don't know,
Gohan. What d'ya think?

292
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,125
[GOHAN] I don't know either!
What do you think?

293
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,875
[KRILLIN] Well, if Korin
got a whiff of that mist,

294
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,541
this is the last place
on Earth that I'd want to be!

295
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,625
Hey! What's the deal?

296
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,958
[BOTH] Shh!

297
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,708
[KRILLIN] Maron, be quiet!

298
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,833
Man! Sorry, Gohan.
Let's move in. Ready?

299
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,291
Yeah!

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,666
It's so cold! I'm freezing!

301
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,916
[MARON]
Can you guys get me a--

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,791
[BOTH] Shh!

303
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,166
Hey! What's the problem, guys?

304
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,750
[MARON]
Nobody's even around!

305
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,791
Krillin, there!

306
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,000
Huh?

307
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:12,333
[distant clanking]

308
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,166
Oh, hey! What's shakin'?

309
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,375
Yo, dudes! What's goin' on?

310
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,416
Hi, guys!

311
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,791
Boy, are we glad to see you two.

312
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,583
It's nice to see you, too.
But you woke me up from a nap.

313
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,416
[giggles]

314
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,083
What a cute little cat!

315
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,625
Ahh! Huh?

316
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,625
[moans lightly]

317
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,083
That's enough!

318
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,625
Whoa! My word! Who is this girl?

319
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
Uhh, Maron.

320
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:47,166
Now look here! This is a holy
place! Not a beach hang-out!

321
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,666
Uh, yes, sir.

322
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Maron is Krillin's
new girlfriend. Heh!

323
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,166
Oh, really?

324
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,333
Yes, sir. [laughs nervously]

325
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,833
For now!

326
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,750
All right! How did
a dog-ugly guy like you

327
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,291
score that chick?

328
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,541
Hey, cool it on the ugly stuff!

329
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
Now what's up, you guys?

330
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,000
So, how can I help you today?

331
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,958
[GOHAN] Oh, yeah! Gosh!
I don't know where to begin!

332
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,625
It's crazy down there!

333
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,041
Just calm down!

334
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,208
It'll be easier if I just
read your thoughts!

335
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,666
Oh!

336
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,375
Yowza! This is terrible!

337
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,875
So, you're heading
to Kami's to get

338
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,583
the Sacred Water, are you?

339
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,958
Uh huh!

340
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,750
Boy, that's not
going to be easy.

341
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,083
Garlic Jr.'s not stupid.
He'll be watching like a hawk.

342
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,041
Eh, so, you guys,

343
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,458
it's vital that you get there
before the others warn him.

344
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,750
Time is absolutely of
the essence in this endeavor.

345
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,916
[KORIN]
Ah, hey! You're leaving?!

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,875
Time is of the essence, Korin!

347
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,375
Take care of Maron!

348
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
[KORIN] Wait a second,
this isn't fair!

349
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,833
[MARON] Krillin, you said
I could come with you!

350
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:11,250
You guys can't do this to me.
Get back here right now!

351
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,208
Huh?

352
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,666
[MARON] You're so cute!

353
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,916
Will you stop that? Heavens!

354
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,208
[KRILLIN] Look how
trashed this place is!

355
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,916
Mr. Popo would have a
heart attack if he saw this.

356
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,583
[GOHAN] It's creepy, isn't it?

357
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,041
[KRILLIN] Yeah...

358
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,583
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

359
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,875
So you don't like
the new decor, aye?

360
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,375
Well, what do you two know?

361
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,291
You little do-good punks!

362
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,208
[laughs]

363
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:57,083
So you want the Sacred Water?
Well come and get it!

364
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,625
Gohan!

365
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,833
Right!

366
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,583
[BOTH yell]

367
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,041
Piccolo! Yeah!

368
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,000
Gohan! He's not normal!

369
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,083
[KRILLIN] He's been
infected by the mist!

370
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,708
[growls]

371
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,458
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

372
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,500
What took you two so long?

373
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,208
We've been waiting
for you! So has he!

374
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,500
Man!

375
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,875
Ugh! This isn't looking good!

376
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,083
[chuckles]

377
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:44,833
[growls]

378
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,125
[NARRATOR] With Piccolo now
under the control of the mist,

379
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,958
how will Gohan and Krillin
fight this battle?

380
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,416
On the next episode

381
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,333
of Dragon Ball Z!
