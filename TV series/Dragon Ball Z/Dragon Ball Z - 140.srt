[BULMA screaming]

318
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,333
[BOTH grunt]

319
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,666
[squeaking]

320
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,875
[BOTH sigh]

321
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,208
Uh, well guys...
level with me would ya?

322
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,375
Something's out there... right?

323
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,875
Right!

324
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,583
I guess I should go,

325
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,583
'cause I don't want to
get in the way...

326
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,458
If anything happens,
call me at Capsule Corp.

327
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,083
Or, uh, I'll call you
at Master Roshi's...

328
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,708
She's kinda bugged out.

329
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,125
[BULMA] Oh, and Trunks,

330
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,541
don't be a stranger
and visit me sometime!

331
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,208
You're grandparents
would love to meet you!

332
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,708
[thinking]
I wish I knew what on Earth

333
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,875
was going on around here.

334
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,875
Hmmm.

335
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,583
[KAMI] These new developments
are most unsettling, Mr. Popo.

336
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,375
[POPO] Yes, Kami.

337
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,083
Haven't you gotten tired
of standing there yet?

338
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,708
You're just wasting
your time, you know...

339
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,291
[PICCOLO] You can watch events
unfold as long as you'd like.

340
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,833
It won't change anything.
We're still going to have to

341
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,708
combine our powers
to fight the Androids!

342
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,625
For the last
four years I have felt

343
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,750
a terrible disturbance taking
shape on the earth below.

344
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,416
A great evil.

345
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,541
But I'm afraid it wasn't
the Androids that I sensed...

346
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,750
Huh?

347
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,375
There is another threat...

348
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,833
A vile creature, which I'm
afraid will prove to be

349
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,833
a hundred times
more lethal and cunning

350
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,041
than even the Androids!

351
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,166
What are you talking about?

352
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,833
Explain yourself
right now, you hear me?!

353
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,250
[KAMI]
I'm sure the day will come

354
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,958
when I give up being
guardian of the earth.

355
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,541
Then, and only then, can we
ever unite to fight as one.

356
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,166
[KAMI grunts]
[PICCOLO groans]

357
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,000
[growling]

358
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,000
[KAMI] Piccolo!

359
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,916
We will wait for
this new evil to surface.

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,708
And you will trust me.

361
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,125
I know what is
best for the earth.

362
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,708
But until I know exactly
what we're dealing with

363
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,000
I cannot make my decision!

364
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,125
[NARRATOR] Things are getting
interesting for our heroes.

365
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,250
While a monstrous creature
has mysteriously

366
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,666
come from the future
in Trunks' time machine,

367
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,958
three unstoppable
Androids are preparing

368
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,666
to bear down on a sickly Goku!

369
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,875
If Kami's hunch is correct,
the world faces a danger

370
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,458
unlike any it has
ever faced before!

371
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Is there anyone who can
oppose this terrible threat?

372
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,000
Find out, on the
next exciting episode

373
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,500
of Dragon Ball Z!
