[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,708
Fine, here we go...

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:24,125
The rivers,
the trees, the wind...

4
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,458
And all the living
things in nature...

5
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,125
I ask of you...
Please offer me the power

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,958
of your
fighting spirit!

7
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,375
[NARRATOR] Goku called
upon the forces of nature

8
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,291
to help him form the only
weapon capable of stopping

9
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,625
the rampaging Vegeta...
The Spirit Bomb.

10
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:44,291
But before Goku could
deliver the finishing blow,

11
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,125
Vegeta unleashed a
devastating counterattack

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,041
that brought our
hero to his knees.

13
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,541
Without the
Spirit Bomb,

14
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,083
Goku had little chance of
defeating the monstrous Vegeta.

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,875
But even though all
hope seemed lost,

16
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,291
Goku was determined to
fight to the bitter end.

17
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,500
I have no more power to defend
myself against this monster.

18
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,583
I hope it buys
me more time.

19

[APE VEGETA growling]

20
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,750
Damn yooouuu!

21
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,416
[NARRATOR] Having exhausted
the last of his strength,

22
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,916
Goku's life is in the hands
of the merciless Vegeta.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,833
And the evil Saiyan
will not be satisfied

24
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,000
until he has squeezed
every last breath

25
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,708
from our hero's body.
Will this be the end for Goku?

26
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,375
The pressure's on...

27
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:37,333
Today on
Dragon Ball Z!

28
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,416
We're almost
there, Gohan.

29
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,083
Hang on, Dad!

I would, it's just...

33
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,250
Against that monster,
what could I do?

34
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,583
[screaming continues]

35
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,625
Sorry about this, Goku,
but you know how it is...

36
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,250
I gotta look out
for number one!

37
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,958
I hope you won't
take it personally.

Look, there!
It's just up ahead.

44
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,416
[GOHAN] The sky is so bright,
Krillin... What's going on?

45
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,333
I wish I knew. But
whatever that weird light is,

46
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,166
it's not natural,
that's for sure...

47
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,583
I've got a bad
feeling about this...

48
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,416
Huh?!

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,166
What in the
world... is that?!

[APE GOKU roaring]

51
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,541
Aagh!

52
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,916
Gohan! Wait! We better
not go near that thing!

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,541
But, what about Dad?

54
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go down
here and hide!

Who is that?

56
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,000
[thinking] He's transformed
into a giant ape...

57
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,791
Just like
Goku used to do!

58

[GOKU screaming]

00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,833
[APE VEGETA] What's wrong,
Kakarot?

60
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,208
You don't look like
you're in enough pain...

61
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,208
Have some more!

62
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,708
Goku's in pretty
bad shape. Come on!

63
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,083
We have to
move fast!

64
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,541
[GOHAN] Right!

65
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,333
[YAJIROBE] Stop!

66
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,833
Yajirobe!

67
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,416
Hey! What are
you thinking?

68
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,125
Do you know how strong
that monster is? Do you?

69
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,791
[KRILLIN] We've
gotta help Goku!

70
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,833
And how exactly are you
planning to do that?

71
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,958
It's suicide!

72
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,083
We've got
one chance...

73
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,833
If we cut off his tail,
he'll turn back to normal.

74
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,583
His tail?

75
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,000
But how?

76
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,916
You two go out there
and get his attention,

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,916
while I sneak up behind him...
I only need a few seconds.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,958
I know it's risky, but unless
you have any better ideas,

79
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,000
it's our
only choice.

Hurry!
Or Goku's toast!

81
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's go!

82
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,625
Give me a break. You two want
me to get his attention?

83
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,000
And what if he does
turn small again?

84
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,250
Face it you guys,
he's still gonna be

85
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,500
way too strong for
us to beat him.

86

[thinking] Hold on, Dad.
We're coming!

87

[thinking] Goku has no power.
We've got to hurry.

88
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,375
If we don't move fast,
he could die any second!

Ah, do whatever you want.
I'm out of here.

down, right now!

you say!

I'll put your father
down if you want,

It might be one
piece at a time,

put him down!

would you like first?

[GOHAN] You better
not hurt him!

too late for that.

How did he know?

Did you really think you could
sneak up on me, little man?

118

Did you really think
that you could fool me

simple ruse?

Ha! I knew from
the instant I saw him

123
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,625
that he was merely trying

124
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,750
to distract me from
the real threat.

You'll have to do
better next time.

00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,291
[VEGETA] How could
I be so careless?

161
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,291
[KRILLIN] He never
even saw it coming!

162
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,291
Wow! Who woulda' thought
Yajirobe had it in him!

163
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,791
[thinking] All right. I've
done my good deed for the day.

164
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,833
They can take it
from here.

165
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:27,541
You're all...
going to... pay!

166
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,250
[KRILLIN whimpering]

167
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,291
You've disgraced me for
the first and final time.

168
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,708
I thought cutting his
tail would stop him...

169
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,750
It just made
him angrier!

170
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,750
You're going to know a new
meaning for the word pain!

171
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,208
You will all suffer!

172
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,291
[YAJIROBE whimpering]

173
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,125
[VEGETA chuckling]

174
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,583
Hrrgh!

175
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,041
Gohan!
Get out of there!

176
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:18,166
[GOHAN whimpering]

177
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,375
What's wrong?
You seem scared.

178
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,000
Ooh... auugh...

179
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,916
A brave Saiyan like yourself
shouldn't be scared,

180
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,375
it's not becoming!

181
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,791
I guess those powers of yours
are taking a nap. Pity.

182
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,291
Patience, little man.
You'll get your turn.

183
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,833
Oh, man! Great!
We're all doomed!

184
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,041
[VEGETA laughing]

185
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,500
Up, you brat. Get up!

186
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,708
I'm not through with
you just yet...

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,583
Come on, boy! Defend yourself!
I thought you were a Saiyan!

188
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,625
So fight me! Show me
what you're made of!

189
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,875
[GOHAN screaming]

190
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,375
You're low-class scum,
just like your father.

191
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,333
[OX KING] Oh, no, look!
He's got Gohan!

192
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,166
I can't...

193
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,333
How could anyone be
so cruel to a child?!

194
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,458
[OX KING] ChiChi?
Are you all right?

195
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh, wow... It looks 
like she clocked out.

196
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,875
She's just scared. I don't
blame her... Poor thing.

197
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,041
[OOLONG] ChiChi, snap out of it!
Can you hear me?

198
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,791
It's me, Oolong!

199
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,916
[OOLONG grunting]

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,541
Ow! That hurts!

201
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,541
[CHICHI] Fight...

202
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,250
Huh?

203
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,208
Fight him, Gohan.

204
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
Oh?

205
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,750
Huh?

206
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,333
Uhh...

207
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,875
Fight, fight,
fight, Gohan!

208
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,583
Fight! Don't let him beat
you and your father!

209
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,875
You can do it! Get him!

210
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,291
Fight with everything you have!

211
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,708
Fight! Go for it! Fight!

212
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,166
[BULMA] Look out!

213
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,000
[GOHAN yelling]

214
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,750
I think it's time
I threw you out

215
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,291
with the rest of the trash!
You're all used up!

216
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,583
[VEGETA laughing]

217
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,083
Gohan...
It's Dad...

218
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,541
[VEGETA] Well, Kakarot's
awake again...

219
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,541
He just doesn't know
when to quit, does he?

220
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:01,708
Gohan, please don't give up.
Listen, my body is shredded.

221
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,083
I can't use it anymore,

222
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,750
so you're going to have
to fight for both of us!

223
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,250
He's got to be hurting
pretty bad, too...

224
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,416
We can't give in!

225
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,333
This is our only chance!
Please, Gohan!

226
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,083
Dad, I don't think
I can do it!

227
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:19,791
He's just too strong for me!
I'm scared of him!

228
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,916
I hate to say
I told you so...

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,250
But you really should
have joined me, Kakarot!

230
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,500
Now, it's too late!
You had your chance!

231
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,291
Now you, your son, and the
bald guy... you're history!

232
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,458
And let's not forget
about the sneaking coward

233
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,958
who cut my tail!

234
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,875
[YAJIROBE whimpering]

235
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,791
Son, don't be
scared of him..

236
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,041
Hey, you're a lot
stronger than you think...

237
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,750
Piccolo trained
you very well.

238
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,375
You have to have faith
in him... You can win!

239
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,750
And look!
You're not alone.

240
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,375
You still have Krillin
to lend you a hand.

241
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,916
I can't move. I don't
think I can do it, Dad!

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,958
Yes, you can! I know
it, and so did Piccolo!

243
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:05,375
He believed in you! That's why
he gave his life to save yours!

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,291
[PICCOLO screaming]

245
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,416
I believe in
you, too, son.

246
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,666
Haah!

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,583
Waugh!

248
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,708
[VEGETA laughing]

249
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,000
Being a good fiend is like
being a photographer...

250
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,583
You have to wait
for the right moment.

251
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,083
Go-Gohan...

252
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,833
[VEGETA laughing]

253
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,125
[VEGETA] Sorry! Father-son
time is over!

254
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,000
No... Dad, no...

255
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,208
[GOKU screaming]

256
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,166
No... Stop...

257
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,166
[VEGETA laughing]

258
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,500
I said STOP!

259
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,958
Huh?!

260
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,833
You heard me!

261
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,291
Let's go!

262
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,958
Sure, kid.
Why not? I'm game.

263
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,083
[GOHAN growling]

264
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,541
Rrgh!

265
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,791
Little punk!

266
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,875
Krillin, come here, quick...
Gohan needs our help...

267
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,625
Well, there's more to
this kid than I thought...

268
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,291
[KRILIN] I'm sorry, Goku,
but in my condition,

269
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,583
I'm not sure
I can help him.

270
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,291
I wouldn't last a
minute up there!

271
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,416
Right. You don't
have to fight...

272
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,125
It's just a one shot
deal... Come closer.

273
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,708
I have some energy that
I need to give you.

274
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,416
[KRILLIN] Ah, no offense, Goku,

275
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,125
but you don't look like you
have any energy to spare!

276
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,458
I know, but
it's not mine.

277
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,375
I gathered a bunch of energy
earlier, from the Earth.

278
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,791
Most of it got away
but I have a little...

279
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,583
It should be enough to stop him
if you can hit him with it.

280
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,291
Yeah... If...

281
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:32,458
All right... Let's do
it... Take my hand...

282
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,916
But are you sure
I can handle it?

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,375
Yes! You have to!

284
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,750
Well, let's hope
you're right...

285
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,041
Grab hold!

286
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:42,458
Gotcha...

287
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,250
Rrgh!

288
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,208
Hey, I don't feel
anything, Goku!

289
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,833
You will. Just give
me a few seconds.

290
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:56,416
Okay! Now relax!

291
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,750
Oh, wow.
That's a lot of power!

292
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:28,750
Man! Hey, Goku! What...
What do I do with this thing?

293
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,500
First, turn
your palm up.

294
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,333
Then use your will power
to concentrate the energy

295
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,041
and form it
into a ball!

296
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,958
[VEGETA growling]

297
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,208
You little brat!

298
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,666
Uwaah!

299
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,500
Clear your
mind, Krillin...

300
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:03,416
Don't try to force the energy.
Just let it flow through you...

301
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,166
Wow, I did it!
Um... what'd I do?

302
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,666
It's a Spirit Bomb.
King Kai taught me...

303
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,333
That kid hurt me!

304
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,875
Listen... You can do
this. I know it...

305
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:32,708
But, you have to
be very careful.

306
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,750
We... We only get one shot
at this. Make it count!

307
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,541
Right. Got it! 
I'll do my best.

308
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,458
[NARRATOR] A glimmer of hope
has returned to the battlefield.

309
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:46,875
With the
Spirit Bomb,

310
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,250
Krillin and Gohan now
have one final chance

311
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,416
to defeat the evil Vegeta.
Can they succeed?

312
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,791
