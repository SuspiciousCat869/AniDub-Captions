00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,625
things were looking up!

3
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,000
With Piccolo
keeping Frieza busy,

4
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,708
Goku was able to complete
his ultimate weapon,

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,333
the Spirit Bomb!

6
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,666
Drawing energy from
all living things,

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,208
it was an attack not
even Frieza could ignore!

8
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,583
[FRIEZA] No, that's...

9
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,500
impossible!

10
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,875
[NARRATOR] The awesome power of
the Spirit Bomb seemed too much

11
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,208
for him to handle as he
struggled to hold it back.

12
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,541
[NARRATOR] It was a tense
moment indeed on Planet Namek,

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,875
as the hopes of our heroes
were riding on this one attack.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,625
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
finally conquered

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,666
the vicious tyrant of space?

16
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,958
[NARRATOR] Will the
universe once again be safe

17
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,041
from Frieza's greedy claws?

18
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned
to find out today.

19
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,916
You-You think that's
the end of Frieza?

20
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,833
I hope so...

21
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,916
But where's my daddy...?

22
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,000
He was pretty close to
the blast when it went off!

23
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,291
So maybe he...

24
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,583
Maybe he was too close!

25
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,458
Hey, don't worry!

26
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,541
But I can't feel his...

27
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,000
his presence...

28
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,708
That's because you're
not concentrating

29
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,291
hard enough on it, Gohan.

30
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,708
And besides,
he was with Piccolo.

31
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,166
They're both alright.

32
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,625
Hm?

33
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,166
Look...

34
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,250
What is that...?

35
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,375
Over there!

36
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,833
Huh...?

37
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
It's Piccolo!

38
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,333
[PICCOLO groans]

39
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,375
Goku!

40
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,416
It's my dad! He's alive!

41
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,833
Yeah-ha-ha!

42
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,375
[BOTH laugh]

43
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,125
Well, Gohan, what're
you waiting for?!

Ah, man...

47
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,041
It's hard to fly
because we used up

48
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,208
most our energy
against Frieza!

49
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,000
Piccolo!

50
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,458
Dad!

51
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,000
[GOHAN] Dad! Piccolo!

52
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,583
Huh...?

Oh, Goku!

00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,958
Are you... okay?

Hey, Piccolo...

Yes?

63
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,125
Aw, nothin'...

Hey...

68
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,875
Sorry to make you worry!

69
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,208
Aww...

70
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,375
Goku, your Spirit Bomb
was just awesome!

71
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,333
It was so huge!

72
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,041
That's because it was
filled with the energy

73
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,375
of every living creature
in the solar system.

74
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,708
I gotta admit, I thought that
I'd never see you again!

75
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,250
Surely you must
have had more faith

76
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,416
in your father than that?

77
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I guess now we can all
get back down to Earth!

78
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,458
For a while there, I
didn't think we'd get back!

What I meant was, it's not
that I didn't have faith

83
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,416
in Goku it's just...

84
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,375

He's finally defeated Frieza!

about, you old kook?!
