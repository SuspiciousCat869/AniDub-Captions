Are you? 'Cuz yeah.

157
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,708
Yeah, sure!

158
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,250
So hey! Maron!
When's the big day!

159
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,041
Have you and Krillin
set a date yet?

160
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,083
A date? No way! No!

161
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,875
What does that mean?

162
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,166
No way? Huh?

163
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,916
[CHICHI]
I know! She's playing it smart!

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,916
It's wise to be cautious
in these matters! She knows!

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,791
It's all about commitment
and hard work! Right?

166
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:31,041
[MARON laughing]You middle-aged
ladies crack me up!

167
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,708
What middle...

168
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,166
...aged ladies?

169
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,583
[BOTH] Well she's a
lot older than I am!

170
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,583
I'm not middle-aged, she is!

171
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,000
You have some nerve!

172
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,833
You're older than
me and you know it!

173
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,791
But I've always been
the prettiest one!

174
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,958
And you know that!

175
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,625
You think skimpy
clothes make you prettier?

176
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,541
Well, think again, you bimbo!

177
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,375
[BOTH growling]

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,833
[ROSHI meows]
Catfight!

179
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,291
Nobody wants to have
fun around here!

180
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,833
Oh, well. Shoot! I'll just
go somewhere else then!

181
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,666
[GOHAN] Krillin!
Are you sure about this?

182
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,541
It's an awfully big ocean!

183
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,333
[KRILLIN] The Turtle said
it was around here somewhere!

184
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,416
[KRILLIN]
Gohan, look!

185
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,208
[GOHAN]
Yeah, I see it! Good eye!

186
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,458
[KRILLIN]
C'mon!

187
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,000
[KRILLIN]
What in the-- Huh?

188
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,708
[GOHAN]
Strange little guy!

189
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,958
[KRILLIN]
Aw, man! Bummer!

190
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:02,875
[GOHAN]
Huh?

191
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,541
Oh, wow! It's beautiful!

192
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,041
[GOHAN] Krillin! There's a
treasure! Back in that ship!

193
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,458
Huh?

194
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,791
Man!

195
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,250
[GOHAN]
Krillin, look!

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,833
[KRILLIN]
Oh, wow! Yeah!

197
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,541
[GOHAN]
Wow, cool!

198
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,666
[KRILLIN]
Yeah! This is awesome!

199
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,666
[GOHAN]
Look how bright it is!

200
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,750
[KRILLIN]
I know, it's like daylight!

201
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,458
Huh?

202
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,541
[BOTH]
Whoa!

203
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,000
[KRILLIN]
This is crazy!

204
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,375
[GOHAN] Calm down, guys!
We're not going to hurt you!

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,791
[KRILLIN]
Gohan!

206
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,958
That's it! Wow!
The Mermaid's Tear!

207
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,875
[GOHAN]
It's incredible!

208
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,375
[KRILLIN yelping]

209
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,125
[GOHAN] Man! This place
is really mystical! Look!

210
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,041
[KRILLIN] Wow! I had no idea
that it was this beautiful!

211
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,208
It's fantastic!

212
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,333
Huh? Krillin! Behind you!

213
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,458
Huh?

214
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,333
[KRILLIN yells]

215
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,791
[GOHAN]
Look out!

216
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,708
Holy cow!

217
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,166
[KRILLIN]
Yow!

218
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,958
Oh, man!

219
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,125
Uh, oh! Here we go again!

220
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,625
[KRILLIN sighs]

221
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,875
[KRILLIN yelps]

222
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,083
[KRILLIN yelling]

223
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
Krillin, no!

224
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,791
Huh? The Mermaid's Tear!

225
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,250
Krillin, The rocks!

226
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,416
Huh?

227
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,500
[KRILLIN]
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

228
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,625
[GOHAN]
Yeah!

229
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,416
Unbelievable!

230
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
Oh, my gosh!

231
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,708
Look, Krillin,
they're protecting it!

232
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,375
They think the Mermaid's Tear
belongs to them!

233
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,500
[KRILLIN] But they're just fish!
What do they want with a pearl?

234
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,125
[GOHAN] I don't know but look!
They're ready to fight for it!

235
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,333
Yeah, I guess you're right!

236
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,708
[GOHAN] Are you sure you want
to take it from 'em, Krillin?

237
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,041
Look at 'em!

238
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:14,666
Gee, I-I don't know,
Gohan! What do you think?

239
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,208
Well, we could get it
from them easy enough,

240
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,791
but I think I'd kind
of feel like a member

241
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,000
of the Ginyu Force
if we did!

242
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,125
Huh? What do you mean?

243
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,125
[GOHAN] You know, like
the fish are the Nameks

244
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,125
protecting one of their Dragon
Balls and we're the Ginyu Force

245
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,333
that's come to take
it away from them!

246
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:36,333
[KRILLIN] Yeah! Wow, I never
looked at it that way!

247
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:45,958
Oh, man! Maron's like the pearl!
I have to let her go!

248
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,333
[KRILLIN]
Gohan!

249
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,708
Huh?

250
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,416
[KRILLIN] Hey? Let's get out
of here! Let's go home!

251
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
Krillin! Are you sure?

252
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,875
[KRILLIN]
Yeah I'm positive!

253
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,875
Thanks Gohan.
Thanks for being you.

254
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,750
[KRILLIN]
Hi, Maron! It's me!

255
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,083
Huh! Oh, hi.

256
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,416
[MARON]
Hey, what's the deal?

257
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,458
You're not being your
usual fun self, Krillin!

258
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,083
I'm starting to get bored!

259
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:52,250
Oh, sorry! It's just that
well, sometimes... sometimes--

260
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,166
Sometimes?

261
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,583
When you love
someone, sometimes

262
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,750
you have to set 'em free!
Because it's the best thing!

263
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,166
So, uh... that's what I'm doing!

264
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,875
I'm setting you free! Goodbye!

265
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,625
Bye, Krillin!

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,083
Thanks for everything,
Krillin! We had fun!

267
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,291
You'll always have a
special place in my heart!

268
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,958
[KRILLIN]
Thank you, Maron! Goodbye!

269
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,708
[MARON]
Goodbye!

270
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,458
[MARON]
I would've said yes, you know!

271
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,958
I couldn't refuse
someone as sweet as you!

272
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,458
Sure, I know you
would've said yes!

273
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,208
Yes! Holy cow!

274
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,750
[KRILLIN]
Did I really just hear that?

275
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,291
Maron! Hey!

276
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,125
[KRILLIN yelps]

277
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Uh! I must be nuts!

278
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,708
[KRILLIN]
Just look at her!

279
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,666
Maron, wait!

280
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,000
Huh?

281
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,833
Hey!

282
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,000
You need a ride?
I'm going downtown, babe!

283
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,291
[MARON]
Buy me an ice-cream?

284
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,541
Sure thing.

285
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,625
[MARON]
Goody, goody! Sure, I'd love to!

286
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,458
[KRILLIN]
Hi, everybody! It's me!

287
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,708
[BULMA]
Where's Maron?

288
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,875
Well, things were
gettin' complicated,

289
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:07,916
so I broke up with her!
You know how it goes!

290
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,041
[ALL gasp]

291
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,375
Oh poor guy!

292
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,041
Aw. It's a darn shame!

293
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:17,208
Well, I don't believe it!
I'll bet she dumped him!

294
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,583
Oolong!

295
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,583
You're outrageous! Bold move!

296
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,250
I'm glad! I hate to say it!
But there was something

297
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,125
about her I didn't trust!

298
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:31,541
Yeah, you're much better off.
I think that Maron girl

299
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,625
was nothing but trouble.

300
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,208
You too? Man!

301
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:42,458
[KRILLIN laughing]

302
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,125
Krillin...

303
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:55,291
[KRILLIN laughing]
