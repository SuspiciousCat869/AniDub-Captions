00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,666
Faced with the terror of
Frieza and his evil henchmen,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,958
three brave Namekian
warriors stepped up

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,958
to meet
the challenge!

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,541
[NARRATOR] Though
heavily outnumbered,

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,500
the Nameks launched into
battle with all their might...

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,916
Stunning
Frieza's men

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,458
with their unexpected
show of power.

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,208
[NARRATOR] The Nameks moved
with lightning speed

10
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,500
and with their superior
strength and agility,

11
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,375
their enemies found
themselves chasing shadows,

12
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,208
unable to land
a single blow.

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,750
And for a time, it seemed
the forces of good

14
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,208
would win the day...

15
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,625
Raaugh!

16
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,166
[yelling]

17
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,083
Go! Go! Go!

18
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,625
Atta way!

19
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,125
[NARRATOR] But the scene took
a sudden turn for the worse,

20
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
as Frieza ordered his
lieutenant Dodoria

21
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,541
to put an end to the
Namek resistance...

22
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,375
[DODORIA] So do you just want me
to kill one as an example?

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,750
[FRIEZA] Kill them all.

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,041
[NARRATOR]
That's when the Namek Elder

25
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,041
made a bold,
and desperate move!

26
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,625
The scouters!
I should have known.

27
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,750
That's what
he's aiming for!

28
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,250
[thinking]
That crafty old dog.

29
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,000
Uh, wait a second.

30
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,458
Why is he just
destroying the scouters?

31
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,041
Think about it!

32
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,833
Without the scouters,
Frieza and his men

33
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,791
won't be able to find the
Nameks or the Dragon Balls!

34
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,666
Even if Frieza gets the Dragon
Ball he's looking for here,

35
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,041
he's gonna have
a heck of a time

36
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,041
tracking down the next one.
You gotta admire him.

37
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,666
He's risking everything
to protect his people!

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,041
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
the Elder's bravery

39
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,166
in the face of danger

40
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,833
only served to incur
Dodoria's wrath...

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,875
[DODORIA] You think you're
pretty smart, don't you?!

42
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,000
But you're not!

43
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,333
I'll kill
all you Nameks!

44
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,291
[DODORIA] And I'm
gonna start with you!

45
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,333
[DODORIA yells]

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,333
[NARRATOR] Dodoria attacks!
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

47
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:22,916
Raaugh!

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,625
[NAMEKS gasping]

49
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,583
[GOHAN and KRILLIN gasping]

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,500
[ELDER NAMEK grunting]

51
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,833
Elder!

52
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,041
Dodoria!
Not yet!

53
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,666
[FRIEZA] I want
you to eliminate

54
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,875
these three young
warriors first!

55
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,208
[DODORIA yells]

56
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,416
[DODORIA chuckles menacingly]

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,666
[DODORIA]
All right.

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,125
A little appetizer
before the main course.

59
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,416
[DODORIA chuckling]

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,458
[DODORIA] Now, which one of
you pathetic weaklings

61
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,291
wants to be
first to die?

62
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,250
[NAMEK 1] Don't be ridiculous.
There's three of us!

63
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,750
We have you
outnumbered.

64
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,458
Oh? Don't think you'll
find safety in numbers.

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,083
I can take on
twelve of you.

66
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,541
Huh?!

67
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
Waaugh!

68
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,375
[NAMEK 2 growling]

00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208

00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,500
Taah!

even faze him?! Come on!

[FRIEZA] Heh, heh...

92
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,125
So, do you
finally understand?

93
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,625
As I've tried to explain
to you from the start,

94
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,375
it is impossible for
you to defeat us.

95
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,625
Now, give me
the Dragon Ball!

96
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,666
[MOORI growls]

97
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,291
[FRIEZA] Good. You
can trust me when I say

98
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,458
you've made the
right decision.

99
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
And since you owe us
something in return

100
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,833
for destroying
our scouters,

101
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,208
I think this is more
than an equitable trade,

102
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,125
don't you agree?

103
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:35,250
[NAMEKIAN CHILDREN whimpering]

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,875
You wretch...
You leave me no choice.

105
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,625
Just promise me you'll
leave us in peace!

106
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,083
[ZARBON] Hmph.

107
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,833
[FRIEZA] Oh,
and don't worry

108
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll keep an eye on the
children until you get back.

Calm down, Gohan. I told you,
we're just gonna have to wait.

I don't like
it either,

Oww!

Wow, whoever said
"no pain, no gain"

123
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,583
definitely wasn't
kidding! Ow!

124
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,791
Here, now you have what you
came for. Take it and leave!

125
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,250
[FRIEZA] I'll do that.

126
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,708
[FRIEZA] And while I'm deciding
whether or not to kill you,

127
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,916
tell me where to find
the last two Dragon Balls!

Take your Dragon Ball
and leave us as promised!

You'll get nothing
more from me!

[FRIEZA] Hmph.

132

Go. For the last time,
go now, and leave us in peace!

And considering
the circumstances,

00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,625
I'd hardly say
you're in a position

to be issuing
threats.

137

Now, tell me what
I want to know,

00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,958
or I'll beat
it out of you!

One: You're lying.

147
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,041
And two: You've already
hindered my search

by destroying
the scouters.

149

Normally, I'd say that's
more than enough reason

150
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,750
to kill you.
But I'm feeling generous.

151

I'll give you one last
chance to save yourself.

should I trust you?

the word of a murderer?

Oh well, I guess
you caught me.

I was planning to kill
you even if you talked.

Even without the scouters,

it shouldn't be too difficult
to find the next village.

Yes, Zarbon. You must
have read my mind.

high above.

the smallest false step,

weight of his wrath
