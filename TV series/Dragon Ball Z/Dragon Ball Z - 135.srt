[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,500
the diabolical Dr. Gero's evil
plans were short circuited

4
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,333
by one of his
own killer creations.

5
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,250
Trunks, the boy from the future,

6
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,375
had predicted the
doctor's demise

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,500
but this bizarre turn
of events sent everyone's

8
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,666
head spinning --
especially the doctor's!

9
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,708
The black-haired
Android 17 took control

10
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,708
and with the help of the
blonde beauty, Android 18,

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,500
the digital duo
unleashed a third android.

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,541
Perhaps the most
dangerous of them all.

13
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,916
This new hi-tech
titan revealed that

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,416
the recently disconnected
doctor had programmed him

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,458
for one purpose only --
to destroy Goku!

16
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,125
But Vegeta, fueled by his
extra large ego and his new

17
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
Super Saiyan
powers, caught up

18
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,750
with the fearsome
threesome on the highway.

19
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,458
Now it's up to Vegeta
to pull the plug on this

20
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,083
hi-tech triple threat.

21
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,791
But can he do it alone?

Alright, I'll show him!

So it's ladies first is it?
Well that's just fine with me!

Okay, see you later!

00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,208
[MASTER ROSHI]
Why you!

00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:33,041
Face it, I'm a lot stronger
than you'll ever be!

167
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,458
I doubt it.

168
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,375
You're so weak, I won't
have to even break a sweat!

169
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,083
[ANDROID 18] For your
information I've been

170
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,625
taking it easy on you.
I know how fragile

171
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,333
you flesh and blood
types can be.

172
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,583
[VEGETA] Oh really!
Well don't do me any favors!

173
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,375
Because I guarantee you, I won't
be showing you any mercy!

174
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,833
Hm. Well Okay!

Tell me, Vegeta. I'm curious...

181
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,625
[ANDROID 18] What is it like
to feel this kind of pain?

[ANDROID 18 grunts]

[ANDROID 18]
I know I'm being hard on you,

184
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,625
but it's the only
way you'll learn.

00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,875
[ANDROID 17]
Hm.

186
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,041
[ANDROID 17]
Hm?

187
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,833
Are you okay in there Vegeta?

188
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,708
[VEGETA weakly] Of course
I am! Why wouldn't I be?

00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,458
Hm?

00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
You're all right!

191
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:37,750
[VEGETA laughs] Of course!
That was just a lucky punch.

192
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,583
[VEGETA]
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:44,500
I told you I don't need your
help and I don't want it either!

194
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,791
[ANDROID 17]
Look at that!

195
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,458
Vegeta's friends have
come to his aid!

196
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,625
Android 18 can take care
of them all by herself

197
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,708
but maybe I should help her.
Unless, you might want to?

198
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,500
What do you say, 16?
You up for a fight?

199
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,833
No, I will not fight them.

200
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,416
You won't? Is something
wrong with you, man?

201
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,958
So, you're just gonna stand
there like a statue, is that it?

202
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:18,291
I told you. I will
only fight with Goku!

Alright...

204
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,291
Have it your way, pal.

00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,000
[ANDROID 17] But I sugget you
loosen up before you rust!

206
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,541
Uh-oh... There's another android
approaching at 12 o'clock.

[KRILLIN whimpers]

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,500
It's time to get out of here.
We should leave now

209
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,958
and come back when Goku is
better! Then we'll fight them!

210
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:40,958
What is wrong with you?
Run away? I'm staying!

211
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,666
You should listen
to your friend.

212
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,458
He's the one who will have
to clean you off the highway.

213
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,208
Are you kidding me?
You want me to leave now,

214
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,416
when we're just getting
to know each other?

215
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,375
You should be so lucky.

216
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,375
I fight alone. I don't
need the help of anyone

217
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,125
and that includes
these Earthlings,

218
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:04,333
the Namec and most
of all Kakarot!

219
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:08,041
I am the most powerful
Saiyan who has ever lived!

220
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,708
[VEGETA] I fear no one!
Especially not this android!

[clapping]

222
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,583
A beautiful speech.

223
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,166
I can see it now.

224
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,250
You truly are a prince with
the royal blood of a Saiyan!

225
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,291
[VEGETA]
Stay out of this one, Android!

226
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,250
I'll deal with
you soon enough.

227
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
Once I've finished with her.

228
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,291
Well, I'd hate to deny
you the opportunity

229
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,750
to test your
strength against 18.

230
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:45,291
So, I'll make a deal with you.

231
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,791
[ANDROID 17] I'm willing to
stand aside and let you fight

232
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,333
as long as you fight alone.
But if any one of these

233
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,958
'friends' of yours tries to
assist you in any way, well...

234
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,583
I'll be forced to step in.

235
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,791
[VEGETA] You don't have
to worry about this group.

236
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,416
They're a bunch of cowards.

237
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,375
They won't risk
their lives for me!

238
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,791
Then, you agree?

239
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,250
[VEGETA]
Yes, I agree.

240
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,750

Then let's continue?

00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,333
Bring it on!

242
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,916
As you wish!

Looks aren't everything.

00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,291
You fight quite well for
being such a little man.

It's impressive, even
if you are a Saiyan!

[VEGETA]
I know.

There are few willing
to train as intensely

as I did to achieve
this kind of power.

It's amazing...

I never knew my
father was so strong.

I can't believe he's fighting
that android one-on-one!

00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,541
[PICCOLO] There's no way
Vegeta can keep fighting

at this intensity!

He can't win!

him burn up all his energy

276
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,208
and then she's
going to attack him!

don't you think?

[NARRATOR] This looks like the
beginning of the end for Vegeta.

305
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,208
Even with his
Super Saiyan Strength,

306
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,041
he was still no
match against

the unlimited power
of Android 18.

Now Trunks has
jumped into the fray

00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,666
but what chance does he
have? Is he about to make

310
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,000
the ultimate sacrifice
for Vegeta?
