[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,041
it looked as though Vegeta
had the upperhand on Cell.

4
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,541
But don't count
Cell out quite yet.

5
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,833
Knowing of the Saiyan's
thirst for battle,

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,250
he lured Vegeta into
a mind-boggling agreement.

7
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,875
Now go and absorb your android.

8
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
Hopefully the next
time I see you,

9
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,250
you won't be in
such a pitiful state.

10
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,291
It's embarassing!

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,458
[NARRATOR] But will
allowing Cell to power up

12
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,750

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,708
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Krillin held the fate

17
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,208
of the other Androids in the
palm of his hands... literally.

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,916
With one flick of the switch,

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,666
Krillin could shut down
Android 18 for good,

20
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,833

reaching his completion.

crucial moment of decision,

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,791
Krillin opted to spare the
beautiful android's life.

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,250
You shouldn't be here.

26
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,208
Look, if cell finds you,
then we're all doomed!

Please go.

28
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,500
[NARRATOR] Has Krillin's
fit of compassion

29
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,125
sealed the planet's fate?

30
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,208
And if things
weren't bad enough,

31
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,000
Cell has stumbled
upon the alcove

32
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,041
where the androids are hiding.

33
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,916
[NARRATOR] The scales of victory
are tipping in Cell's favor,

today on Dragon Ball Z!

what I have been looking for!

Soon, 18 you will be mine!

37
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,500

we're up here!

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
But Cell is hot on your tail and
he'll do anything to absorb you!

And if that happens,
the entire planet is doomed!
