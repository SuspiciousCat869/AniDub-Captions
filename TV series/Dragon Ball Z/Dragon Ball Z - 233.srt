00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Last time, on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,916
The efforts of Gohan
and the Supreme Kai

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,208
to destroy the ball encasing
Majin Buu proved useless.

4
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] And the magic
creature that had lain dormant

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,916
since human kind's
infancy was unleashed.

6
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,041
[NARRATOR] Both sides were
perplexed when nothing appeared

7
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,083
from the ball but a
barren cloud of smoke.

8
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,125
Sighs of relief were
short-lived, however,

9
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,916
as the spiraling cloud soon took

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,166
the shape of the
bizarre Majin Buu.

11
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,416
Buuuuuu!

12
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:56,125
[NARRATOR]
Make that very, very bizarre...

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,541
Pudgy, pink,
and with a wide grin

14
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,875
that seemed incapable
of leaving his face,

15
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,666
it was easy to doubt Buu's label

16
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,958
as the single-greatest
threat to the universe.

17
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
Awww...

18
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,750
[NARRATOR] But despite doubts
from Gohan and the others,

19
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,000
the horrified
Supreme Kai was certain

20
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
this was the Buu of the past.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,041
Yes, that's Bibidi's
creation without a doubt.

22
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,250
I could never forget that
disgusting creature's face.

23
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,458
Buu!

24
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,625
[NARRATOR] Long ago,
Majin Buu was responsible

25
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,250
for the destruction
of entire galaxies...

26
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,125
But what is the extent
of his power now?

27
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,166
Could a creature so
simpleminded and childish

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,791
really pose a threat to the
battle-hardened Z Fighters?

29
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,083
Buu! [giggles]

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,125
[NARRATOR] Gohan stands
ready to face this new threat,

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,958
while Dabura and Babidi,
after their long struggle

32
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,041
to resurrect a creature
they'd never seen,

33
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,458
remain speechless
at its curious result.

34
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,833
[NARRATOR] Is it possible
that Buu's strength

35
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,541
has weakened during
his centuries in captivity?

36
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,291
Has he become
outdated in his time away?

37
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:09,291
Or is there still some unknown
horror hiding behind that smile?

38
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,750
Buu!!

39
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:43,791

[grunts]

41
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,208
Uh... Huh?

42
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,083
[GOKU]
Vegeta, wait!

43
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,583
Uh?

44
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,500
There, I felt
that power surge again.

45
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:04,333
Huh...? [pants]

46
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,666
We know that it's Majin Buu.

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,750
What we don't know is how the
others are faring against him.

48
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:17,583
[pants]

49
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,875
[snickers]

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:33,458
[VEGETA laughs]

51
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,000
It's as I thought, there is
nothing to worry about, Kakarot.

52
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,291
This Majin Buu has been
revealed as a weakling.

53
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,708
At least, by the measuring
bar you and I have set.

54
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,750
[VEGETA] Is it too hard
to understand, clown?

55
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,166
The Saiyan race has evolved

56
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,708
since that creature
was entrapped!

57
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,083
Think of what
the Supreme Kai said!

58
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,916
He's been constantly
surprised by our strength!

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
On Babidi's ship we conquered
what were supposed to be

60
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,666
the strongest
fighters in the universe,

61
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,500
and we barely broke a sweat!

62
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,416
Think about it Kakarot.

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,916
We Saiyans have taken
a ruling place in the universe

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,875
that even its greatest
overseer couldn't predict.

65
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,833
And Majin Buu may
have ruled in his time

66
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,916
but now he's sorely outclassed.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're... wrong... I can... feel
something deeper inside him.

68
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,750
Enough of your feelings!

69
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,541
You're just stalling because
you know I'm going to beat you!

70
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,750
No Vegeta, I know you
can sense the same thing.

71
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,666
[GOKU] You're just too
proud to admit it.

72
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,416
[BUU hums]

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,083
[BABIDI giggles]

74
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,500
Look at my face, Buu!

75
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,208
I'm the son of Bibidi,
your creator! See?

76
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,666
You can call me the Great Wizard
Babidi or just Wizard or Master,

77
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,000
since that's what
I am to you now!

78
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
Hmmm?

79
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
[chuckles]

80
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,208
[nervously] See if it weren't
for me you'd still be trapped

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,291
inside of that ball forever!

82
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,500
Eh... Uhhmm...

83
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,250
[giggles nervously]

84
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,041
[BUU]
Hmph!

85
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,583
[shocked] Nyaaa?

86
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,250
Hey... What's the
meaning of that, Buu?

87
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,500
You can't turn your back
on your master like that!

88
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:30,208
At least give me a proper
greeting! Turn around!

89
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,208
I command you!

90
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,791
[BUU grumbles]

91
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,916
What's wrong?

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,708
Is something incorrect
with your body, Buu?

93
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:59,166
Hahahahaha!

94
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,041

He is but a fool!

96
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,833
[GOHAN]
What's happening over there?

97
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,791
Is he playing with them?!

98
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,458
What nerve!

99
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,041
It is difficult to say why.

100
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,541
But his revival has
clearly been incomplete.

101
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,000
I had great hopes
for this Majin Buu.

102
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,833
But this deformed
version is nothing

103
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,791
but an idiot and a waste.

104
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,500
Hmm?

105
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,791
Oh, what's wrong? Do you have
a problem with what I've said?

106
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,625
Buu!!!

107
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,208
Huh?

108
00:08:54,291 --> 00:09:01,500
Pow! Pow! Pow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! POW!

109
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:06,208
A pity; he's not even aware
enough to know he's outmatched!

110
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,750
Run along Buu!
Or shall I turn you into stone?

111
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,750
Guess Babidi made a real
mess out of reviving him.

112
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,333
He's acting like an infant.

113
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:26,791
There has been no mistake,
Buu has always been this way.

Well let's think
this through, Goten...

That way feels scary,
so it's probably more fun.

that Buu monster is!

162
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,375
[MR. SATAN thinking]
And that one fellow...

163
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,833
How could he have done that?

164
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,000
He killed those people---
My fans!

165
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,083
And with some
kind of explosion trick.

166
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,291
It was just like
Cell all over again!

167
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,583
[crowd screaming]

168
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,833
[snickers]

169
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,791
[thinking] I wonder if
the whole thing was staged?

170
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,208
Some promotional gimmick
that they didn't tell me about?

171
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,708
Hmph.

172
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,083
[thinking]
It felt so real, though...

173
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,625
And one thing I know

174
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,833
is that real things
usually mean something bad.

175
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,750
[REPORT A] Mr. Satan!
Congratulations on your victory!

176
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,125
[REPORTER B]
You were fabulous!

177
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,791
[REPORTER C] What will
you do with the prize money?

178
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,625
[REPORTER D]
Can you give us your angle

179
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
on what happened today?

180
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
[REPORTER E]
Do you have a plan?

181
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,250
Heh. Well you know I wouldn't
keep anything from my fans!

182
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Hahahaha!

183
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh...

184
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,125
[ooos; ahhhs]

185
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,125
We don't have any
time for this now Vegeta.

186
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,416
We're the ones who
let Buu out of his shell!

187
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,791
It's because of us!

188
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,625
[VEGETA]
Buu is just a side-show!

189
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,166
You are my only concern!

190
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,000
Everyone on Earth
will be killed!

191
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,250
You hear me?!
Bulma, Trunks, everyone!!

192
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,083
Shut up!!!

193
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000
Shut... up!!!

194
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,416
Remember I've sold
my soul to Babidi.

195
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,583
I keep no loyalties.

196
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,166
I have a Saiyan heart
that depends on strength alone!

197
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,833
They're nothing to me!

198
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,750
Liar!

199
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,083
[gasps]

200
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,333
I don't... buy it!

201
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,583
Talk all you want Vegeta

202
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,458
but you better convince
yourself of it first.

203
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,500
[VEGETA]
Fine.

204
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,541
You win.

205
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,583
Our battle is postponed.

206
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,250
I want you at your fullest when
we fight and you're obviously

207
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,458
too distracted by
that ridiculous Buu.

208
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,625
Vegeta.

209
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,541
[VEGETA] Well don't just stand
there, get out your Senzu Beans!

210
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,333
We should be at full
power when we face him.

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,166
With all of us working together
I'm sure we can beat this guy.

212
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,583
[VEGETA] So Kakarot,
even you can prove helpless

213
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,500
when you drop your guard.

214
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:47,208
[VEGETA roars]

215
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,625
[VEGETA thinking] I'll take
care of this Buu myself.

216
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,708
The last thing I need is for
this clown to play hero again

217
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,708
and dangle it over my head.

218
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
We'll finish this fight
when I return, Kakarot.

219
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,458
Enjoy your sleep.

220
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,666
And should your time
run out before I'm done...

221
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,750
Heh heh. Then we'll have to
continue this another day.

222
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,791
[VEGETA]
When I see you in hell.

223
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,416
[BABIDI] Your revival
was a complete success!

224
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,083
Now we mustn't waste a second.
You must obey my every command!

225
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,708
With you as my tool this entire
universe will be cancelled out!

226
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
Nyaaaa!

227
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,583
[growls]

228
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,041
Lalalala!

229
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,750
So, do you think
it's wise to disobey me?

230
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,375
I'm well-versed in all
my father's incantations, Buu.

231
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,958
I can put you back in that ball
with a phrase if you like.

232
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,541
Buu?

233
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,958
[BABIDI] Now you
don't want to be trapped

234
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,208
in there again, do you Buu?

235
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,541
Huuuuh?

236
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,791
Huh? Ohhhh! Hohohoho!

237
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,916
--[BUU] You master!
--[BABIDI laughs]

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,166
--You! You!
--Yes, I think this...

239
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,333
...arrangement
will do just fine!

240
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,666
[GOHAN]
Supreme Kai.

241
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,250
Buu's definitely strong
but he's only acting

242
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,375
because he's afraid
of getting sealed up.

243
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,750
If we could just take
Babidi out of the picture...

244
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
There won't be anyone
commanding Buu

245
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,541
and maybe we could control him!

246
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,916
We mustn't, Gohan!

247
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Babidi is the only
living being who knows

248
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,041
how to put Buu back
inside his ball.

249
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,208
Without him we'd be doomed!

250
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,875
That creature
might appear innocent,

251
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,000
but he has a deep-seated
need for destruction.

252
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,375
Eventually, Babidi will
lose control of him too.

253
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,958
When he does, he will be
forced to seal him up again.

254
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,375
And that will be
the time to strike.

255
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,625
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to wait for that moment.

256
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,166
Unfortunately Gohan...

257
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,958
The two of us probably won't
be the ones to make that move

258
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,791
as it looks like we will be
the first in Majin Buu's path.

259
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry. This isn't the
way it was supposed to be.

260
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,583
I was confident I could stop
Babidi before Buu was revived.

261
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,500
If, only I had known.

262
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,708
If only I had watched this part
of the universe more closely

263
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,291
and seen there were people
like you whose physical strength

264
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,708
has the potential
to far exceed my own.

265
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,750
Then the method
might have worked.

266
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,250
What method are
you talking about?

267
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,000
No, it's too late.

268
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,500
The two of us won't be
able to escape Majin Buu

269
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,916
to carry it out.

270
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,791
We'll have to rely
on Goku and Vegeta.

271
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
[GOHAN]
Oh, listen to yourself!

272
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,416
Are you just gonna stamp dead
on your forehead and give up!

273
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,416
[BABIDI]
Your attention, please!

274
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,750
Huh?!

275
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,000
Here is my first command!
Kill those two idiots.

276
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,291
And let's try to be
quick about it, huh?

277
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,208
Huh?!

278
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,291
Ah!

279
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,791
[BUU]
Buuuu!!!!

280
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,416
Huh?

281
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,916
[GOHAN]
Come on!

282
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,958
Don't you worry! I'm pretty
confident about my speed.

283
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,000
Hey what are you
standing around for?!

284
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,208
You're letting them get away!

285
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:37,458
[coughing]

286
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,958
I sure hope he comes back.

287
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,375
[GOHAN] Well it looks
like no one's behind us yet.

288
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,833
Huh?

289
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,416
[gasps]

290
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,208
Ah!

291
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,291
Laaaaaa!

292
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,708
How could he??

293
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,458
You drop dead!

294
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,958
[BUU giggles]

295
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,333
[NARRATOR]
To the Earth's great misfortune,

296
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,583
it seems Buu's revival
is a complete success!

297
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,583
He's put Gohan out of
commission with a single blow,

298
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,500
leaving the Supreme
Kai totally open to attack!

299
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,875
The losses are already starting,
and the anger-blinded Vegeta

300
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,416
is the only Z Fighter
still on his feet!

301
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,166
Does the side of good
even stand a chance?
