[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,500
Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan
reached Piccolo's homeworld

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,125
of Namek in their quest
for the Dragon Balls.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,000
Little did they know,
the forces of evil

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:27,125
were also converging on
this once peaceful planet.

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,500
The worst among them...
The sinister Lord Frieza.

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,916
Who, with his merciless
band of henchmen,

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
had already
managed to sweep

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,666
four of the seven Dragon
Balls into his clutches...

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Lord Frieza, we've
detected a group of Nameks,

11
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,875
not far in
that direction.

12
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,750
Well, that's good news.

13
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,250
And with any luck,

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,500
they'll have the fifth Dragon
Ball in their possession.

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,458
[NARRATOR] As these villains
scoured the planet,

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,500
it was all our three
young heroes could do

17
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,125
to stay out
of harm's way.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,916
[KRILLIN] They'll catch us if we
don't find a place to hide!

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,625
[BULMA panting]

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,500
I found a cave. It should
be a great spot to lie low.

21
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,541
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
trouble has come

22
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,666
looking for them!

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,208
And they're about
to come face-to-face

24
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,083
with the greatest evil they
have ever known... Today!

25
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,625
On Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
[GOHAN] Krillin, are
you sensing that?

27
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,291
That energy...

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,291
Yeah, it feels pretty strong,
and it's still rising!

29
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,625
Whoever that is, it's--

30
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,166
Trouble! Everyone!
Into the cave!

31
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,666
What's going on?

32
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,333
Bulma, get in here!

33
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,416
[BULMA] I'm coming!
I'm coming!

34
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
[BULMA] Now are you gonna tell
me what's going on or not?

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,250
I don't see anything!

36
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,458
[KRILLIN] Shh! Quiet.
They're coming right for us.

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,458
So what do you think?
Do you think they spotted us?

38
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,083
I don't know...

39
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,291
[KRILLIN] There!

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,583
[BULMA squealing]

41
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,333
[squealing continues]

42
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,291
It looks like
they're gone.

43
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,750
That was close. But I don't
think they noticed us.

44
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,666
They didn't even slow
down at all. I don't know.

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,875
They must be heading
after something else.

46
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,666
Huh?

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
[KRILLIN whimpering]

48
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,333
[GOHAN panting]

49
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,916
What is it, you guys?
What's the matter?

50
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:14,333
[KRILLIN] Bulma, you'd better
check the Dragon Radar...

51
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,750
'Kay. But why?

52
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,166
When... When we
checked it before,

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,208
those four Dragon
Balls we saw,

54
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,166
all gathered in the same
place... Look again.

55
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
See if they're
still there.

56
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,875
Yeah, sure.
I got it.

57
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,666
[BULMA] They're... They're
moving. All four of them!

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,208
Whoever those
guys are,

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,625
they have the Dragon
Balls with them!

60
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,125
[KRILLIN] I was
afraid of that...

61
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,041
This is bad.
Real bad.

62
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Gohan!

63
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

64
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,958
[GOHAN] Sorry.

65
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,791
[KRILLIN] Believe me,
I understand.

66
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,166
So you saw that guy
flying near the front?

67
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah... Yeah, I
saw him all right.

68
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,250
H-He was
like, pure evil.

69
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,250
And his power level's the
highest I've ever sensed.

70
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,750
Me too. And I've
got a bad feeling

71
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,583
this is the same guy
those kids told us about.

72
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,083
I don't know. It might not
be Frieza, but either way

73
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,125
our situation has just
gotten a whole lot worse.

74
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,291
Why? I mean, he can't be
stronger than Vegeta, can he?

75
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,291
I'd say he is and not just
a little bit, either.

76
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
I mean a lot.

77
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,083
Not to mention all those
other guys he had with him.

78
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,375
And we've gotta
figure out a way

79
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,750
to get the Dragon
Balls from them!

80
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,291
How're we
gonna do that?

81
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,083
Quick, quick, look!

82
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
They're heading directly
for another Dragon Ball.

83
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,375
It's like they know
just where it is!

84
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,666
[KRILLIN] Oh, that's just great!
So they have radar, too.

85
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,791
Which way?

86
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,333
[BULMA] Over there.
The Dragon Radar

87
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,416
says it's about
ten miles that way.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Hey, Krillin, while
we were walking,

89
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,750
didn't you sense a
group of Namekians

90
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,291
coming from
that direction?

91
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,750
Right. Well,
I guess we better go

92
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,208
find out what's up.

93
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,416
I'm going with you!

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
What?! Are you
guys nuts?

95
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,041
What about me?! You can't just
leave me here all by myself!

96
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,875
[KRILLIN] All right. You can
come chase the bad guys

97
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,416
with us if
you really want.

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,750
Well, I suppose I
could come along.

99
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,208
But, then again, it might
be best for one of us

100
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,875
to stay and hold down the
fort, don't you think?

101
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,166
Good idea, Bulma.

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,208
Now, don't do
anything stupid!

103
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,791
Remember, Gohan, keep your
power level pushed down

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,291
so they don't spot us
coming. Think you got it?

105
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah.

106
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,000
Be safe, you guys. I can't
make it home without you.

107
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,208
Which reminds me, I'd
better call Master Roshi

108
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,750
and let him know
what's going on!

wrong with you?

from Namek.

Oh, sorry, I, uh, talk with

So, then, how are
they? Is Gohan okay?

143
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,208
Well, you know,
they all arrived

144
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,000
on the planet
safely. But...

145
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,958
I'm afraid the good
news ends there...

146
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,333
See, it's Vegeta...
Evidently, he's on Namek, too,

completely healed and
stronger than ever.

No way!

And believe it or not,
it gets worse.

someone else there.

she can fix it.

00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,625
I'm just worried about
this stronger force.

158
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,958
Yeah, me too.

159
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,208
I mean, someone even more
powerful than Vegeta?

160
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,041
Who could it be?

161
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,833
Hey, what's going on?

162
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,416
Actually, I don't
really wanna know.

163
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,916
But I got somethin' here
that should cheer you up.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,916
It took forever, so I
hope you're grateful.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,541
A gift from Korin.

166
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,458
One bag of
fresh-picked Senzu beans.

167
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458
Should have you up
and runnin' in no time.

168
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,583
Oh, yeah! Yajirobe!
Perfect timing!

169
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,875
You have no idea how
much I need those!

170
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,166
Hold on. You're not giving any
strange foods to my patient!

171
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,625
Sorry, Doc.

172
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,166
[BOTH whimpering]

173
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,750
[chuckling]

174
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,291
This is great!

175
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,333
I've been waiting forever to
get out of these dinky pajamas.

176
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
And back into the uniform
King Kai gave me!

177
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,291
Yeah... Finally!

178
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,541
There! Now no time
to waste. Off to Planet Namek!

179
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,875
Thanks for the
Senzu Beans.

180
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,833
From the sound of things,
I think I'll need 'em.

181
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,333
But, Goku! How in the world are
you planning to get to Namek?

182
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,583
Oh, well, when Bulma's dad came
to visit not too long ago,

183
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,750
I asked him if he could build
another spaceship for me.

184
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,166
I thought it'd be
good to have one,

185
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,833
in case something
like this came up.

186
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,375
Oh, so then he figured out how
to build a ship like Kami's?

187
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,833
No. He
couldn't do that.

188
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,875
He said Kami's ship was made
with a bunch of materials

189
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
that are probably
only found on Namek.

190
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,458
What? So...

191
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,500
So, I remembered
the ship I came in here

192
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,041
as a baby was
never destroyed.

193
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,375
At worst, it should
just be a little rusty

194
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,625
from sitting out
there all these years.

195
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,625
Dr. Brief said he'd find
it for me and fix it up!

196
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,250
And seeing as how he's as good
with technology as Bulma,

197
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,250
I'll bet it's
ready to go!

198
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
Heh, heh!
Good thinkin'!

199
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,500
Do me a favor, and tell
ChiChi not to worry about me.

200
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,291
Tell her I'm just going
to make sure Gohan

201
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,666
and the others
are all right.

202
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
They're gonna need some help
if that mystery person's

203
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,833
power level is anywhere near
as high as you say it is.

204
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,833
Tell her I'll be back
as soon as I can!

205
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,916
Flying Nimbus!

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Well, wish me luck.

207
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,916
[DOCTOR stuttering]

208
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,833
[BOTH squealing]

209
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,791
[GOKU] See ya', guys!

210
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,708
[CHICHI humming]

211
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:06,750
What? That's Goku!
Just what in the world?!

212
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,958
Where do you think
you're going?!

213
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,125
You didn't even pack
clean underwear!

214
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
You know what he
is, don'tcha?

215
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,375
[ROSHI]
Hm? What's that?

216
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,916
[YAJIROBE]
Crazy, that's what!

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,458
He's not even out
of bed five minutes,

218
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,208
and he's already rushin'
off to another battle!

219
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,416
Goku's always loved
a good challenge.

220
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,333
And he's sworn to protect those
who can't protect themselves.

221
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,250
On top of that,
he's a Saiyan,

222
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,500
so the thirst for battle
is in his blood.

223
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,666
So, he's a Saiyan. Well,
that definitely explains it.

224
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,208
He's not just crazy.

225
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,708
He's crazy and he's
from another planet!

226
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
[thinking] I can't believe
there's another fighter

227
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,375
out there that's even
stronger than Vegeta!

228
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,666
I just hope Gohan and Krillin
can hold things together

229
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,125
'til I get to Namek!

230
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,333
Gohan, you're putting
out too much energy!

231
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
Keep it as
low as you can!

232
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,208
Right, got it.

233

Sorry to
just drop in.

237
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,750
Don't mention it!
Are you feeling better?

238
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,291
Yeah. Strong as an ox.

239
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,333
So, does your husband have that
spaceship ready for me yet?

240
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,750
Oh, goodness, no.
Not even close.

241
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,000
But he's still
working on it.

242
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,458
Not even close?!

243
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,583
I mean, really?

244
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,208
[MRS. BRIEF] Tell you what.
Why don't we go check on him?

245
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,708
[GOKU] Oh, thanks.

246
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,041
[MRS. BRIEF] And
how's that adorable

247
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,291
little boy of yours doing?

248
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,375
I'm just dying to
finally meet him.

249
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,833
I bet he's getting to be
quite the looker. Handsome!

250
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,000
Just like his big,
strong father.

251
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
He's doing okay.

252
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,916
And, he's turning out to
be a heck of a fighter!

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
A chip off the old
block, huh?

254
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,791
And how is ChiChi?

255
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,916
I haven't seen her since
I don't know when.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Shame on you, Goku!

257
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,458
You really need to come
visit more often! You know?

258
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,833
Yeah, well
I've been busy.

259
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,375
[MRS. BRIEF] Oh, sweetums!
Darling! Goku's here to see you!

260
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,375
Wow... I don't believe it.
So this is my ship, huh?

261
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,166
I didn't think it
would be so big!

262
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,208
[MRS. BRIEF] Honey!

263
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,708
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, Goku! You're
looking much better!

264
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,250
[GOKU] I'm all healed
and ready to go.

265
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,708
I was actually
wondering

266
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,750
if you were done with
my spaceship yet.

267
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,375
Still a few bugs to
work out. Come on in.

268
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,250
I'll be right back with
some refreshments, 'kay?

269
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,708
Oh, sure. Thank you!

270
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,458
Oh, wow!

271
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,791
It's huge!

272
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,541
I can't believe you did
all this! It's incredible!

273
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,958
Not really. Just hard work
and a bit of elbow grease.

274
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,291
It looks like it's got
everything I need.

275
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750
Glad you like it.

276
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,875
But, I won't lie to you...
It wasn't an easy task.

277
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,250
Your old ship was
practically demolished!

278
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,000
I was able to salvage the
engine and a few key parts,

279
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,208
but otherwise I had to
build this from scratch!

280
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,166
But I thought my ship
would've been okay!

281
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,250
That's weird.
I must've smashed it

282
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,708
when I was a baby
or something.

283
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,125
Who knows? Anyway, I
installed everything

284
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,291
you asked for.
Even the training stuff.

285
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,125
Really? Wait, even the
artificial gravity machine?

286
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,625
Ha! She's right
over here.

287
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,416
[GOKU] Perfect!
So, how does it work?

288
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,291
Here's the knob
that controls

289
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,000
how much gravity
you're training under.

290
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,958
You can set it to go anywhere
from double to 100 times

291
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,250
the Earth's
natural gravity.

292
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,166
Be careful you don't end
up like a pancake, though.

293
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,416
Because that's exactly
what'll happen to you

294
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,666
if you set the machine
too high too soon.

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,791
This isn't a toy. So please,
use extreme caution.

296
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,833
Don't worry, I will.

297
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,166
But I'm gonna have to
do some heavy training

298
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,375
before I
get to Namek.

299
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,250
So, how much longer until
she's ready to fly?

300
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,375
She's ready now! Anywhere in
the universe you want to go.

301
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Ah! What?

302
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,500
[DR. BRIEF] And there's a full
kitchen down this way.

303
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,333
And to get to the bathroom,
you follow the green arrows.

304
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,875
[GOKU] Wait a second! I thought
you said it wasn't finished yet!

305
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,916
And that's the truth. It isn't
finished. Far from it.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,875
I haven't installed
the cappuccino machine yet.

307
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,875
What?! Are you kidding? I
don't care about cappuccino!

308
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,333
Well, you say that now,
but wait until you wake up

309
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,666
and you want a nice
warm breakfast beverage

310
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,333
to start your
day off right.

311
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,125
[GOKU whining]

312
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,375
But, there's no time!
I'm in a big hurry!

313
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,458
I've got to get to the
others right away! Really!

314
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,041
[DR. BRIEF] Just another day
or two. What's the rush?

315
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,375
[GOKU] We got a
call from Bulma

316
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
saying they need
my help on Namek!

317
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,041
[DR. BRIEF] Hmm...

318
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,666
C'mon! Just teach me how to
fly this thing so I can go!

319
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,208
Are you positive you're okay
without the cappuccino machine?

320
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,416
Uh-huh!

321
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Well, all the data's
been entered already.

322
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,166
All you have to do
is push the button,

323
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,916
and you're
off to Namek.

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,041
You should arrive there in
under six days, give or take.

325
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
Six days! Great!

326
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,416
That means I can definitely get
there in time to help them out!

327
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
[MRS. BRIEF singing]

328
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,250
Hey! I heard
Goku was here!

329
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
Oh, sure! He's
out checking on

330
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,125
the spaceship if
you wanna see him.

331
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,625
[engines igniting]

332
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,375
[OOLONG] You mean
that spaceship?

333
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,333
[OOLONG and PUAR screaming]

334
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,916
[MRS. BRIEFS] Ohh!
[OOLONG and PUAR screaming]

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,041
[OOLONG and PUAR screaming]

336
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,000
[SCRATCH yowling]

337
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:21,125
Let's see... I think he
said it was this button.

338
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,708
Uhh...

339
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,166
[GOKU squeals]

340
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,208
[DR. BRIEF] Well, what do
you know? It actually works.

341
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,750
Sometimes I amaze
even myself.

342
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,833
Dr. Brief!
Where's Goku?

343
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,375
On his way to
Planet Namek.

344
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,250
[DR. BRIEF] Probably wishing
he had cappuccino already.

345
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,333
We're close. They
must be right up there

346
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,083
over that ridge, Gohan.
We should walk from here.

347
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
Okay!

348
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,250
[KRILLIN] Yeah, feel that?
It's really strong now.

349
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,250
C'mon, we'll get a
better look from up there.

350
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,708
[GOHAN] Right.

351
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,916
Keep really low
to the ground.

352
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,375
[GOHAN] Hmm.

353
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,166
Just our luck, we're
right in front of 'em!

354
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,208
Let's go around.

355
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,666
Right!

356
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,500
[GOHAN] Hey!
That looks just like

357
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,791
the spaceship
we came here in.

358
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,750
[KRILLIN] That's weird.
I thought they had a radar,

359
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,958
but it looks like
they're still searching...

360
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,916
And there's that guy in
the hover vehicle again.

361
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,166
He's definitely
the one in charge.

362
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,125
His power
level's massive!

363
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,833
Yeah, you're
not kidding.

364
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
Uh? Ahh!

365
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,250
Check it out! Take a
look at what those guys

366
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,541
have tucked under their arms!
It's the Dragon Balls!

367
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,708
I can't believe
the size of them.

368
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,000
Huh?

369
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,833
[FRIEZA]
What's wrong, Dodoria?

370
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,375
Does your scouter
indicate something?

371
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know. For a second,
I thought I detected

372
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:42,458
a very weak power level.
And then it just disappeared.

373
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,916
It's probably just a bird,
or a small rodent.

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,208
Nothing that should
cause us any alarm.

375
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:52,375
[GOHAN and KRILLIN whimpering]

376
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,625
[KRILLIN] We gotta be careful.

377
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,583
Cuz, if they spot us,
we're as good as dead!

378
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
[HENCHMAN] Lord Frieza,
we only found five of them.

379
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,666
We're bringing
them out now.

380
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,875
It looks like the others
ran off before we got here.

381
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,375
Let's get moving!

382
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,708
Believe me, you don't want to
make me come in after you!

383
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,791
Huh...?

384
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,166
They look just
like Piccolo!

385
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,750
Guess we found
the Nameks...

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
[FRIEZA chuckles]

387
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,250
It sure is dark out here.
Pretty lonely, too.

388
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,458
[GOKU] But I've got a
lot of work to do

389
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,041
if I wanna get my power level
up as high as Vegeta's.

390
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:59,125
I might as well go ahead
and start training now.

391
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,166
It's not like I have anything
better to do in this place.

392
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,125
Now, let's see...
I trained at 10 times gravity

393
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,791
on King Kai's planet.

394
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,083
So I should probably
start higher than that.

395
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,583
[GOKU] 'Kay... Gravitational
level set to...

396
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,041
Twenty.

397
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,583
[GOKU grunting]

398
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,166
Whoa!

399
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,958
[grunting continues]

400
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,125
Shoulda' tried 11.

401
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,833
[NARRATOR] Goku speeds
toward the Planet Namek

402
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
in an effort to
join his friends.

403
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,708
But with only six days
in which to train,

404
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,416
can he possibly prepare himself
for the terrible new foe

405
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,166
he will face
once he arrives?

406
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,416
The shadow of
Frieza looms large...

407
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,458
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
