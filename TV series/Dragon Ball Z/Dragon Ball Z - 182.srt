00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,833
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:17,250
Goku's battle with Cell
came to a stunning conclusion!

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,500
But the Cell Games
were far from over.

4
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,500
The fighters waited
with bated breath

5
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,416
as Goku prepared to
name the next challenger!

6
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,583
Someone he claimed

7
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,000
would put the evil
android down for good!

8
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,833
But who could it be?

9
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,041
[GOKU] That someone is you, Son.

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,500
[NARRATOR] Gohan!

11
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,291
[CELL] Ridiculous!

12
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,875
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
lost his mind?

13
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,208
[GOKU] Whadda you say, Son?

14
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,000
Go out there and win
this one for me, okay?

15
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,000
[NARRATOR] It seemed our hero
was asking the impossible!

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,250
But young Gohan was determined.

17
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,208
[GOHAN] Okay, Dad. I'll do it.

18
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,333
[NARRATOR] With a
dazzling display,

19
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,708
the pint-sized Super Saiyan
took the Cell Games by storm,

20
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,500
unleashing incredible energy

21
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,125
that far surpassed
anyone's expectations.

22
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
Well, almost anyone...

23
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,250
Frustrated by Gohan's
extraordinary abilities,

24
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,375
Cell's attacks appeared to grow
increasingly out of control.

25
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,500
[BOTH grunting]

26
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,500
[CELL] Well, I'm impressed!

27
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,541
You're pretty fast, aren't you?

28
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,250
What do you say we try
speeding things up a notch?

29
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,458
[NARRATOR] But the vile
creature quickly regained

30
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,083
his handle on the situation,

31
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,375
and soon had the rest of the
Z Fighters fearing the worst.

32
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,916
[TRUNKS] He's losing!

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,916
Don't you even care? Huh?

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,958
Goku, if you don't do something
right now, Gohan is gonna die!

35
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,458
[NARRATOR] Does this
brave young warrior

36
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,041
really stand a chance
against Cell?

37
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:52,375

today on Dragon Ball Z!

Well, Gohan, I see
you're ready for round two.

00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,333
[KRILLIN] Will somebody
please tell me

41
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,958
we're gonna get
Gohan outta there?!

42
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,958
Somebody? Anybody?!

43
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,750
Oh man, I don't believe this!

44
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:41,791
Are we really gonna just stand
here and watch him die? Are we?!

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,250
Gohan!

46
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,041
Gohan, darling! Please!
You don't have to do this!

47
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,541
Oh... I don't want you to die!

You promised me you wouldn't let
our baby boy fight that monster!

52

Oh, my Gohan!

53
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,166
My precious baby
boy is going to die!

I'm never going
to see him again!

[ANNOUNCER gasps]

58
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,083
[PIIZA] Is that little boy
really going to fight with Cell?

00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,458
I am thinking
this kid is hamburger!

I can hardly believe my eyes!

71
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,000
It seems that
the delivery boy has

72
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,708
resumed his fight against Cell!

73
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,666
But I'm afraid our
young hero may be

74
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,166
in over his head this time!

75

is gonna get nuked!

I have a division
of troops ready to deploy.

80

We'll stop that creature.

81
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,458

No. I will not send
any more men to their graves.

Look, General...

87
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,125
Already this young
boy has proven himself

88
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:09,541
more effective against
Cell than our entire military.

89
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,666
It would seem that all
of our hopes rest with him now.

able to do, what my army cannot.

00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,666
Wow, check it out.

167
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Gohan looks intense!
Wish I knew what he was saying.

168
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,625
Hey, can you hear him
through that mic?

169
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,291
No, they're
talking way too quiet!

170
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,208
You don't have to continue
this senseless violence.

171
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,916
You can put an end to all
of it right now. I don't want--

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,291
You don't want to fight.
Yes, I understand that!

173
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,916
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,416
but did I just hear you
threaten to kill me?

175
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,916
Interesting.

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,833
And what makes you think
you can carry out this threat?

177
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,291
Really, do tell.

178
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,166
I know now what my father meant,

179
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,916
I know now why I'm the
only one who can take you down!

180
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:43,291
Don't make me laugh.
You can't touch me, kid.

181
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,250
No, maybe not right now.

182
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,041
But I think it's
important that you know

183
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,958
exactly what's going
to happen if you push me.

184
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,083
[GOHAN] When I
was just a little boy,

185
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,750
a Saiyan warrior named
Raditz came to the Earth.

186
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,000
He was a lot like you, Cell.

187
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,625
He enjoyed hurting others.

188
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,541
Especially my dad.

189
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,125
[GOKU screams]

190
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,375
[GOHAN] Raditz continued
his ruthless torture,

191
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,416
and I was trapped,

192
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,541
helpless inside
of his spaceship.

193
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,250
But I could still
hear my father's screams.

194
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,916
[RADITZ] Just a
sentimental dope!

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,958
You're way too soft to be
a Saiyan Warrior anyway!

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,958
No fair!

197
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,333
I suppose you're right, Kakarot,
but I'm a first-class warrior,

198
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,583
and I won't hesitate to even
kill my own brother if need be.

199
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,750
Now, say goodbye!

200
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,625
[RADITZ grunts,
GOKU screams]

201
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,041
[GOKU screams]

202
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,708
[CHILD GOHAN] Daddy!

203
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,250
[GOKU screams]

204
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
[GOHAN] Each time
he cried out in agony,

205
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,583
my heart cried out
along with him.

206
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,250
The pain I felt at not being
able to help him was maddening.

207
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,666
[GOHAN] Then something happened.
Something snapped.

208
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,041
[RADITZ] Huh?

209
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,000
[GOHAN] The pain that I felt
became so great that I,

210
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,666
I lost myself in it.

211
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,708
The furious blinding force
began to surge through me,

212
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,041
and I knew only one thing:

213
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,250
I had to help my dad,
no matter what.

214
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,250
[RADITZ gasps]

215
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,583
[RADITZ] Power level
one thousand

216
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,166
three hundred and seventy?!

217
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,125
Impossible for a kid!

218
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,875
And yet, it's going up!

219
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,458
[CHILD GOHAN growls]

220
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,041
Leave my dad ALONE!

221
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:43,583
[CHILD GOHAN screams]

222
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:50,041
[RADITZ yells]

223
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,333
[GOHAN] That was the
first time I discovered

224
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,916
that I had a hidden power,

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,541
but I still had no idea where it
had come from or how to use it.

226
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,250
Fortunately, those
were things that

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,375
Piccolo was determined
to teach me.

228
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,708
[CHILD GOHAN wails]

229
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:06,166
Quiet! I can't take that
noise anymore, you hear?!

230
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,416
[CHILD GOHAN gasps

231
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,833
Perhaps you don't
even realize it yourself,

232
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,375
but there is an enormous
power within you, Gohan.

233
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,333
The purpose of
your training will be

234
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,333
to teach you to
control your power.

235
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,458
My power? What
do you mean by that?

236
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,583
Heh!

237
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,375
Let me show you!

238
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,708
[CHILD GOHAN screams]

239
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,583
[CHILD GOHAN] HEY!
What are you doing?!

240
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,666
[GOHAN] I think Piccolo
recognized my power

241
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,833
for what it was.

242
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,083
He knew the only way
it would surface was

243
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,541
if I was faced with a crisis

244
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,750
so great that I had
no other choice but to use it.

245
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,750
This wasn't a voluntary
decision on my part.

246
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,125
It was more like a feeling,

247
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,875
a gut reaction to a
situation beyond my control.

248
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,833
Once again, I lost myself,
and the power emerged.

249
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,208
[GOHAN] Piccolo knew
this would happen.

250
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,416
Wow! No way!

251
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,125
[GOHAN] But I don't think
even he expected

252
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,625
my power to be as
great as it was.

253
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,333
[GOHAN] I would learn even more
about my hidden abilities

254
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,916
while we were on Namek
fighting against Frieza.

255
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,541
Krillin!

256
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,000
[CHILD GOHAN yells]

257
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,250
[GOHAN]
Krillin was hurt really bad,

258
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,083
but I knew that there
was still a chance to save him!

259
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,583
I tried to get to
him as fast as I could,

260
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,625
but before I had
a chance to do anything,

261
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,291
Frieza was right
there... laughing.

262
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,416
[FRIEZA laughs]

263
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,791
Do you really
think you can save him?

264
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,125
Sorry. it's too late!

265
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
[GOHAN] Krillin, my friend,

266
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,250
was sinking to the bottom
of that lake dying.

267
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,666
And Frieza, that
cold-blooded monster,

268
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,041
was actually enjoying it!

269
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,750
I couldn't control what
happened next. I attacked!

270
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,125
I didn't care that Frieza

271
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,083
was the most powerful
fighter in the universe.

272
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,958
I didn't care
that he had the ability

273
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,000
to destroy entire planets
with a single finger.

274
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,125
All I knew was that
I had to help my friend!

275
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,541
And the only way to him
was through Frieza!

276
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:10,583
[CHILD GOHAN yelling]

277
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,875
[CHILD GOHAN yells]

278
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,416
[GOHAN] I still don't
know how it happened.

279
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,458
My memories of those moments
aren't really all that clear.

280
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,291
I was lost in a
raging storm of emotion,

281
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,333
unable to control my actions.

282
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,000
It's like a switch
had been pulled.

283
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
Something opened
up deep inside of me,

284
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,833
and once it opened,
nothing could stop

285
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,333
my power from
raging to the surface!

286
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:41,000
For those few moments,
I was an unstoppable force!

287
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,500
[CHILD GOHAN] Masenko... Ha!

288
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,750
[GOHAN] Once unleashed,

289
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,208
the hidden power within
me was enough to bring Frieza,

290
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,375
the most terrible tyrant
the universe has ever known,

291
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,041
crashing to his knees!

292
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,125
That was a long time ago

293
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,375
and since then I've
gotten much stronger.

294
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,875
My dad even thinks
I'm as strong as he is now!

295
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,083
He took that
into account, I think.

296
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,708
I think he realized that
if I were to be pushed too far,

297
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,583
if I were to lose control,

298
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,416
there's no telling how
powerful I'd become.

299
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,541
And there's no
telling what kind of damage

300
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,458
a power like that might cause.

301
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,208
[CELL chuckles]

302
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,208
[laughing]

303
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,208
[CELL] An interesting story!

304
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,708
But it didn't work.

305
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,166
Huh...?

306
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,250
Well, not in
the way you intended.

307
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,083
But you have given
me something to work for.

308
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,916
You see, Gohan, this "hidden
power" of yours intrigues me,

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,250
and now that I know about it,

310
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,250
I'm determined
to see it for myself!

311
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,083

Oh no!

00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,208
[KRILLIN] Goku,
you can't let this go on!

318
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,500
Cell doesn't wanna fight Gohan,
he wants to fight you!

319
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,291
Goku!

320
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:28,500
Don't worry, Krillin.
Gohan's going to win.

321
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,875
Trust me, 'kay? He's fine.

322
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,958
Go on! What's stopping you?

323

Give in to your anger!
Lose control!

324
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,458
Show me your hidden power!

325
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,000
It's the only way
to save yourself!

326
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,958
[CELL] You stubborn
child! Get mad!

327
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,875
[CELL snarls]

328
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,958
[yelling]

329
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,000
[CELL] Do you hear me?!

330
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,500
I want you to be FURIOUS!

331
00:19:56,583 --> 00:20:00,833
[CELL grunting,
blows landing]

332
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,458
[GOHAN screams]

333
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,916
[GOHAN grunts]

334
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,958
And Cell has just
delivered the delivery boy

335
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,083
another ferocious attack!

336
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,833
How much more abuse
can this noble lad withstand?

337
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,250
Mr. Satan, what
are your thoughts?!

338
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,208
I think this boy doesn't
even have a chance!

339
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,833
He oughtta let
a man finish the job!

340
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,125
Oooh! Does this mean
that the champ's gonna fight?!

341
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,583
[MR. SATAN squeals]

342
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,708
Get ready! Mr. Satan, the
greatest fighter in the world

343
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,208
is about to enter the ring!

344
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,541
[MR. SATAN gasps]

345
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,916
[ANNOUNCER] That's right!

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,333
Oh! The pain! It's my
stomach again! Oh... aahhh!

347
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
[PIROZHKI] Maestro!

348
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,166
Once again, the champ
has fallen victim

349
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,041
to a strange stomach pain!

350
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,791
[screaming]

351
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,166
Huh...?

352
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,375
Ladies and gentlemen,

353
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,583
this fearless announcer
continues to risk

354
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,625
life and limb
to bring you the action!

355
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,750
[GOHAN growls]

356
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,375
[BOTH grunt]

357
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,083
[CELL] Come on!
Show me your power!

358
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,666
Defend yourself!

359
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,083
[CELL grunts]

360
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,958
[GOHAN yells]

361
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,750
[CELL yells]

362
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,708
[GOHAN shouts,
CELL grunts]

363
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,666
Yeah! Way to
stick it to him, Gohan!

364
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,500
[PICCOLO growls]

365
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,875
[VEGETA growls]

366
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,125
[CELL grunting]

367
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,708
[CELL growls]

368
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,416
[GOHAN growls]

369
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:11,583
Well then. It looks like I may
actually get through to you yet.

370
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,958
[thinking] That's right, Cell.
Keep pushing.

371
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,916
Once you back
Gohan into the corner,

372
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,833
he's not going to have anywhere
to go except right through you.

373
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,916
[NARRATOR] While the others look
on anxiously from above,

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,208
down on the battlefield,
the test of will rages on!

375
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,083
Cell has fixed
his icy stare on Gohan,

376
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,541
but the young Super
Saiyan stands firm!

377
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,041
His iron determination,

378
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:41,208
the only thing between the
Earth and total annihilation!

379
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,125
Will Gohan awaken his
incredible hidden power

380
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:47,041
and put an end to the
evil android once and for all?

381
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,000
There's only
one way to find out!

382
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:51,500

exciting episode of

383
