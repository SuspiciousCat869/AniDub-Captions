[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,708
The Cell Games continued,

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,291
moving into the most
furious fighting yet.

4
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,166
Goku's Super Saiyan
powers were put to the test

5
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,083
and he passed with
flying colors.

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,875
To everyone's surprise,
his awesome power could

7
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:30,583
barely be contained
in Cell's tournament ring.

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,250
Not to be outdone,

9
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,833
Cell went into battle mode
after a quick warm up.

10
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,208
The bio-mechanical
menace was determined

11
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,958
to show the whole world that
he could finally crush

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,083
Goku and all the
other challengers.

[NARRATOR]
With unimaginable strength

15
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,583
and an array of stolen fighting
techniques at his disposal,

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,083
Cell has become
a truly fearsome foe!

17
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,291
But Goku is no rookie,
and he, too, was radiating

18
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,208
with pure fighting energy.

19
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,416
As the two figures squared
off, one thing was certain,

20
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,000
the rumble would not
be one to miss.

21
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,041
After an intense exchange,
Cell fired a Kamehameha wave

22
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,541
big enough
to destroy the planet!

23
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,000
But Goku diverted
the blast upward

24
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,291
and used his Instant
Transmission to save himself

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,041
at the last moment,
letting the attack

26
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,458
fly safely
into outer space.

27
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,083
[NARRATOR]
Back on the ground,

28
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,125
Goku ended Cell's strong
offensive with a kick,

29
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:43,083
leaving the never-ending match
at a standoff once again.

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,875
And leaving the vicious Cell

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,833
with a question he had
to have answered...

32
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,875
[CELL] I want you to tell me

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,125
how you are able to
disappear and reappear.

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:58,833
It's my new technique,
Instant Transmission.

35
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,875
[NARRATOR] Cell may not have
Instant Transmission,

36
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,458
but he does have
incredible speed,

37
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,250
and now, he's more
determined than ever

38
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
to prove his perfection.

39
