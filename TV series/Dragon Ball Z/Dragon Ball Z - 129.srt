00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,750
the struggle between man and
machine reached new heights

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,666
as Goku battled Android 19,

4
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,416
a radically advanced artificial
life form, designed by Dr. Gero

5
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,791
to be the ultimate
fighting machine.

6
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,916
After controlling
the entire fight,

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,958
the tables suddenly turned
on Goku and he found himself

8
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,083
at the wrong end of
several punishing blows.

9
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,291
When the going gets tough,
Goku gets going.

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,375
But in this case,
the iron-willed Saiyan

11
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,125
was unable to respond.

12
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,458
Most unexpectedly, Goku
was paralyzed with pain

13
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,500
and seemed incapable
of continuing the fight.

14
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,166
[GOHAN] It's that virus! It's
attacking his heart right now!

Yes! That's it!

[NARRATOR] Trunks' prediction
that Goku would contract

18
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,625
a horrible disease
has finally come true.

19
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,208
But it couldn't have
come at a worse time!

Wait a sec. Hey, Trunks,
what happens to me?

32
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,666
Do I die in the battle as well?

33

Not too long from now,

[TRUNKS] It's a radical virus.

You'll start hearing
about it soon.

39

Not even a Super
Saiyan can beat it.

00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,000
[TIEN] He's holding
on by a thread!

165
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:23,083
[GOHAN] He's unconscious,
but he's still breathing!

166
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,875
[VEGETA] One of you needs to
take Kakarot home right now

167
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,166
and give him the antidote!
He's running out of time!

168
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,000
[GOHAN] C'mon, Dad! You're
going to be alright! I promise!

169
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
I'm taking you home!

170
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,875
Please! Let me!
They need you, kid!

171
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,000
Sad to say, but I'd
just be in the way here!

172
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,166
Hey, you'd better take
a swig of that antidote, too!

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,708
If the disease is viral,

174
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,708
there's a good chance
you could get it as well!

175
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,875
[YAMCHA] Right! Thanks, Piccolo!

176
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,666
I'm counting on you,
Yamcha! Take care!

177
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,291
Better get a move on.

178
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,791
Right! We'll be okay!

179
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,333
Just stay alive
until we get back!

180
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,041
[YAMCHA] Alright,
Goku! Let's do it!

181
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,416
[KRILLIN] Hurry back,
Goku! We need you!

182
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,666
[ANDROID 19 growls]

183
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,625
Let them go!
They pose us no threat!

184
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,083
[ANDROID 19] Hmph!

185
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,375
[ANDROID 20]
You have done well, 19.

186
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,958
It is obvious that Goku
is no match for us.

187
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,666
We can finish him at the
moment of our choosing.

188
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,083
Until then, we will
entertain ourselves

189
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,708
by destroying all of
his pitiful "friends."

190
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,916
[YAJIROBE] Oooh!

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,083
[YAJIROBE blows raspberry]

192
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,875
[BABY TRUNKS laughs]

193
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,541
[YAJIROBE chuckles]

194
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,250
[YAJIROBE]
You like that, don't you?

195
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,916
Heh, heh, heh...
You little stinker.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,041
[BULMA] I had no idea

197
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,125
you were so good
with kids, Yajirobe!

198
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,500
--[YAJIROBE] Huh?
--Yeah!

199
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,208
Usually he starts crying
when other people hold him.

200
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,208
[YAJIROBE] So you like
Uncle Yajirobe, huh?

201
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,625
Well, I like you, too!
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

202
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,833
--Tickle tickle!
--[BABY TRUNKS laughs]

203
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,666
Haaah!

204
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,125
[YAJIROBE grunts]

205
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,583
[BABY TRUNKS wails]

206
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,833
You gave him a
sour face! Poor boy!

207
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,375
He got his feelings hurt!

208
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,458
[YAJIROBE] Hey! I'm the
one who got all wet!

209
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,458
[BULMA] There, there!
It's okay! He didn't mean it!

210
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,583
Oh, no! We're out
of diapers, Trunks!

211
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,875
I don't have anything
dry to put you in!

212
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh, wait! Yajirobe
has something!

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,583
[BULMA giggles]

214
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,541
[YAJIROBE] Hmm.

215
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,416
[BULMA] Thank you, Yajirobe,
you're so sweet! Come 'ere, boy!

216
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,833
[BABY TRUNKS whimpers]

217
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:04,708
There! That's better! Yeah!
Thanks to our Yajirobe!

218
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,291
He always comes through
for you in a pinch!

219
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,541
Eh, that's true.
Yeah. Right...

220
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
[BULMA] Now, let's go see Daddy!

221
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,291
What?! No way!

222
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,416
Yes way! Why not?

223
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,416
Vegeta wouldn't let
anything happen

224
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,208
to his little boy.
We'll be just fine.

225
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,458
No, we won't!
We'll be... dead!

226
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,375
[BULMA] Hey! Come on, man!

227
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,083
Where's your sense
of adventure?

228
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,000
Let's do it!
Please? Come on!

229
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:35,958
And besides... Trunks
needs you! Don't you boy?

230
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,625
[YAJIROBE groans]

231
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,833
[YAJIROBE] Why me?!

232
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,291
Come on and get in!

233
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,375
Alright, but
you listen here.

234
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,791
One peek, and then
we're out of there!

235
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,875
Alright, fine! Don't be rude!
Get in and let's go!

236
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,166
[BULMA growls]

237
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,666
Huh?

238
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,833
Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Here we go!

239
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,208
[YAJIROBE] You're crazy! Whoa!

240
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,333
[ANDROID 20 chuckles]

241
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,208
[ANDROID 20] Yes. This is
going to be very enjoyable.

242
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,958
[ANDROID 20] Hmm...

243
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,625
Gohan! I think it
might be a wise idea

244
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,000
for us to get out of here.

245
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,416
[GOHAN] Huh?

246
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,583
[TIEN] Huh?

247
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,708
[KRILLIN] Remember what that
guy from the future told Goku

248
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,333
about us?! That all of us
except you are going to perish

249
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,041
in a battle against
the androids!

250
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,666
Well, why should we
let that happen?!

251
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,125
It doesn't make sense!

252
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,708
Why don't we get the
heck out of here?!

253
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,833
There are some
minor differences,

254
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,083
but the stage does
seem set for us to die!

255
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,208
Yeah, but If we
leave right now,

256
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,208
those two will probably
go on a killing spree

257
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,500
like they did in that town! Are
you sure that's what you want!

258
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,125
Do you really want to take off?

259
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,416
[KRILLIN] Not for good!
Just until Goku's better!

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,416
There's a chance
that it might not happen

261
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,250
like that guy said it would!

262
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,625
There are
some differences.

263
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,166
Goku being alive
is a major one!

264
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,458
So I say we act
as if we never

265
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,458
heard that guy's
prophecy before.

266

[KRILLIN growls]

267
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,666
[thinking] These
guys are iron-clad!

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,791
It's hard to keep pace
with them sometimes!

269
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,041
I'm only human! I want to live!

270
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,541
I will finish Vegeta now. Yes.

271
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,583
[ANDROID 20] You are being
very greedy today, 19.

272
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,458
You have already absorbed
enough energy from Goku

273
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,625
to increase your power,
have you not?

274
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,541
[ANDROID 20] Very well.
You finish Vegeta,

275
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,541
but the rest are mine.
Do you understand?

276
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,041
Hmm... Ha!

[ANDROID 19 giggles]

279
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,333
I was waching your
battle with Kakarot,

280
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,333
so I've seen your energy
absorbing technique.

281
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,333
Oh well, if I can't
blast you away,

282
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,291
I'll have to pound you
to a pulp, that's all!

283
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,208
You know some
of my moves,

284
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:18,000
but I know all of
your moves, Vegeta!

285
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,958
Oh, yes, Doctor Gero
studied you very thoroughly!

286
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,041
[VEGETA] Oh, is that a fact?
Then why were you so surprised

287
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,375
when Kakarot turned
into a Super Saiyan?

288
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,958
I'll tell you why,
because your database

289
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,666
doesn't cover the
battles we had in space!

290
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,625
Your bonehead creator
picked a fine chapter

291
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,958
to omit from your memory banks!

292
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,958
Oh?

293
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,458
That's right my friend!
Let me ask you,

294
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,958
does a machine like yourself
ever experience fear?

Whoa! You know who joined
the Super Saiyan Club!

306
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,416
He is on our side, isn't he?!

307
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,875
Whoa! I'm confused! I thought
you had to be like Goku

308
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,166
to be one!

309
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,958
Goku's so calm and
detached and purehearted,

310
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,875
but obviously those
aren't prerequisites!

311
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,166
[VEGETA] Afraid not!
There's more than one way

312
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,625
to reach the goal!

313
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,250
Yes! To each his own!

314
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,166
[VEGETA] My motivation was
very different than Kakarot's!

315
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,333
My motivation was
to be the best!

316
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,250
To be the greatest Saiyan
alive as I always had been!

317
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,416
Until Kakarot came into
the picture that is!

318
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,541
[VEGETA] Kakarot's success
was like a demon in my head!

319
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,916
How could he be a
Super Saiyan when I,

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,166
the Prince of all
Saiyans, could not!

321
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,416
[VEGETA] The intensity of
my training was maddening!

322
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
At four-hundred and
fifty times normal gravity,

323
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,458
a basic training game became a
desperate struggle for survival!

324
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,875
[VEGETA yells]

325
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,666
[VEGETA grunts]

326
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,125
[VEGETA yells]

327
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,333
[VEGETA] Even the simplest
moves required every ounce

328
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,916
of will power I had!

329
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,416
[VEGETA] I wasn't sure how
long I could sustain the effort

330
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,166
without breaking in two!

331
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,166
It seemed like the only thing
holding my body together

332
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,750
was my one desire:
to be better than Kakarot!

333
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,125
[VEGETA] At times I thought
I was losing my mind!

334
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,416
Why couldn't I obtain
what Kakarot had obtained?!

335
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,666
It didn't make sense!
It was infuriating

336
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,833
and it was my fury
that kept me alive!

337
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,416
[VEGETA] I decided
to continue my training

338
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,125
in the solitude of space,
where I would be unhindered

339
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,166
by the distractions
of the Earth.

340
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,166
And when a violent electrical
storm erupted in the skies

341
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,791
of the planet I was on,
I welcomed it!

342
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,625
It seemed fitting... Like it
was an outward manifestation

343
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,250
of the storm that
was raging inside of me!

344
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
[VEGETA] Then the meteors
started coming down!

345
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,333
But I was determined to
survive and to protect

346
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,750
my ship from destruction!
It was my only way out!

347
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,000
My only way off of that
nightmarish heap of rubble!

348
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,750
[VEGETA] I thought I had
everything under control.

349
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,750
But then, the mother of all
meteors seemed to appear

350
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:24,083
out of nowhere to claim
my ship and my life!

351
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,625
[VEGETA screams]

352
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,041
[VEGETA yells]

353
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,166
[VEGETA] Normally it would
have been child's play

354
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,625
to blow up that rock!

355
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,041
But after training at
four-hundred and fifty times

356
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,666
normal gravity for so long, it
took everything I had, and more!

357
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,375
[VEGETA screams]

358
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,708
Ka... karot!

359
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,208
Then something just snapped,
something inside of me!

360
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,041
No! No more! That's it!
I don't care!

361
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,625
[VEGETA] I didn't care
anymore! I didn't care

362
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,416
about being
better than Kakarot,

363
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,666
I didn't care about
being a Super Saiyan,

364
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,666
I didn't care if I lived!

365
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,333
I didn't care about anything!
And then... it happened!

366
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,333
[VEGETA yells]

367
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,291
[VEGETA] Yes,
that's how it happened!

368
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,958
That's how I
became a Super Saiyan!

369
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,083
The sleeper has awakened!

370
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,791
I am the prince of all
Saiyans once again!

371
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,916
Enough of this
nonsense, fool.

372
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You may have become
a Super Saiyan,

373
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,375
but your new found powers
are still no match for us.

374
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,041
Please demonstrate, 19!

375
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,250
[GOHAN] Huh?!

376
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,250
--Uh?
--Hm?

377
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,666
[ANDROID 19 laughs]

378
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,208
[ANDROID 19 giggles]

379
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,625
[NARRATOR] As the radically
powerful Android 19

380
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,541
charges down the war-path,
Vegeta stands firm

381
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,291
and confident in his newfound
power. But is it enough?

382
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,416
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
