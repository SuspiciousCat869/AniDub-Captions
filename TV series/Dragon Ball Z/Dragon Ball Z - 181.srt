[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

4
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,041
Goku demonstrated his might by
unleashing a powerful attack

5
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,333
that left Cell's body almost
completely disintegrated.

[NARRATOR]
Unfortunately for our hero,

7
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,750
the resilient Cell
proved once again that

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,833

"almost" just isn't good enough!

Cell was able to restore his
body and continue the fight!

13

Cell closed in for the kill,

but Goku
still had more to give.

15

And in an explosive outburst,
he let loose a furious volley

16

for with only
a minimum of effort,

20
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,625
Cell was able to
reduce the Super Saiyan's

Goku, the Earth's
last shining hope,

25
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,458
was left with only one option:

it's done, won't you?
