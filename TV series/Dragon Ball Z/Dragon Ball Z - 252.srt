[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,000
Trunks and Goten completed
their fusion training!

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,791
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fu... sion... Ha!

4
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,041
Yes! You're doing it!
Stay with it!

5
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,458
Whoa! It worked!

6
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,000
[NARRATOR] With their powers
successfully combined,

7
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,791
the fused warrior
Gotenks was born

8
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,333
and against better judgment,

9
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,375
he hastily set out to
do battle with Majin Buu.

10
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,500
[GOTENKS grunts]

11
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,000
[NARRATOR] Even with
all of Gotenks' strength,

12
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,916
the monster proved
much too resilient

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,916
for the young
fighter to handle.

14
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,250
[BUU screeches]

15
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,166
[NARRATOR] And he was forced
to return to his friends

16
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,375
at the Lookout...

17
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
[BULMA]
Did you beat Majin Buu?!

18
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,708
[NARRATOR]
...defeated.

19
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,791
[GOTENKS]
Not exactly...

20
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,791
He's a-a little
tougher than I thought!

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,208
[ALL groan]

22
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,375
[NARRATOR] Gotenks wasn't
the only one surprised

23
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,166
by Majin Buu's power.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
The world's remaining
military forces

25
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,625
assembled in a desperate bid
to bring the monster down,

26
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,375
but to no avail.

27
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,375
Armed with their
mightiest weapons,

28
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,000
their efforts served only to
irritate the pudgy pink terror.

29
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,250
[GOTENKS] No! Run!
He's going to attack!

[NARRATOR]
With every passing hour,

32
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,291
humanity's hopes for survival

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,666
are growing
fainter and fainter.

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,791
Is there no one left
who can stand up

35
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,166
to the destructive
force of Majin Buu?

Whoo-hoo! Buu go bang, bang!

38

[BUU]
Save for later.

44
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,958
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu continued
his destructive spree,

45
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,000
devouring untold scores of the
world's unsuspecting citizens.

46
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,625
The few remaining military
forces made a bid

47
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,000
to stop the monster

48
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,375
but were unable to withstand
Buu's awesome power.

49
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,583
Now, those few that remain
have gone into hiding,

50
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:17,166
hoping against hope that
a new hero will emerge.

51
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,791
[RADIO ANNOUNCER] Keep in mind
that the information we have

52
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,166
is pieced together from various
pirate radio broadcasts

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,541
around the world.

54
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,666
The devastation
seems to be non-ending,

55
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,083
with at a rough count,

56
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,250
only one fifth of the world's
population remaining.

57
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,041
All of our major
cities are gone.

58
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
The governments are
mostly destroyed

59
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,416
with any and all workable armies
completely out of commission.

60

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is horrible.

61
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,458
However, we have heard
unsubstantiated rumors

62
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,916
that there may be someone left.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,291
Someone left in this
world willing to fight.

64

I repeat, all
of this information

is unconfirmded at this time,

but as the news
trickles down to us

67

to you immediately.

Hope for defeating

What we are beginning to
understand is that Mr. Satan

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,041
has been safely training
in his underground bunker,

72

protected by armed
guards at all times

73

from any type of outside threat.

emerge sometime today!

No fighter that has
ever won a victory

Uh, Pardon me, Mr. Satan.

Please excuse my intrusion

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,625
but there seems to be something
wrong with your voice.

I've been fighting
a bit of a cold.

No problem!
It would be my pleasure

165
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,291
to help you in
your time of need.

You keep shouting like that,

00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,375
and someone's gonna hear you!

I guess he hasn't
noticed us yet.

Look, this is my fight.

175
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,666

leave me to my concentration.

Yes sir, anything to help, sir.

they're out of the way.

and ran off, didn't you?!

I-It was a mistake!

202

I would never do
anything to offend you

Mr. Majin Buu,
it's so good to see you!

213
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,375
I've been wanting to meet you

214
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
since I heard the first reports
of your worldwide devastation!

215
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:10,375
So... Do you want to
be candy, cookie, or pudding

216
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,166
when Buu eats you?

217
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,041
Wait, wait, wait!

218
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
I didn't come here to get eaten!

219
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,291
I-I came to bring
you some presents!

220
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,750
The best chocolates
money can buy!

221
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,125
Buu like big chocolates.
Eat you instead.

222
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
But these are packed
with the same amount

223
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,375
of chocolate-y goodness,

224
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,083
they're just made smaller
so you can eat a lot more.

225
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,416
They look good.
You want to eat, too?

226
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,208
Uh, no thanks,
I'm allergic to chocolate,

He ate it! I can't believe it!

231
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,125
Each one of those chocolates
has enough cyanide in it

232
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,958

Video game?

[MR. SATAN] See, you just use
the little buttons at the bottom

239
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,708

and punch and kick.

in here that doesn't cheat!

favorite stuff in the world!

Oh, yeah, this candy is great.

263
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,458
It's sweet without
being too sweet,

264
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,416
kinda reminds me of the candy my
mom made me when I was a kid.

What do you see?

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,375
I, uh, thought I saw a rabid

00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,083

to mess with you!

00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,791
Only then can you
acquire what you seek.

320
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,416
Are you saying
it's not worth it?

321
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,083
Huh?

322
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:07,875
[GOKU laughs]

323
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,125
[GOHAN]
It's worth it...

324
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,875
Then get started.
No time like the present.

325
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,583
Whatever you say.

326
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,333
Ragh!

327
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,166
[NARRATOR] Now that Gohan
has entered the final stages

328
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,708
of the training ceremony,

329
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,583
his power will soon be increased
enough to combat Majin Buu.

330
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,833
But back on Earth,
how long will Mr. Satan

331
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,500
be able to hold
Buu's temper at bay?

332
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,333
[MR. SATAN] No, no,
allow me to wash your back.

333
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,041
Oh, it's my pleasure!

334
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,833
[thinking] Yeah, you just
enjoy your bath, tubby.

335
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,083
I've got you right
where I want you.

336
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,625
I hope.
