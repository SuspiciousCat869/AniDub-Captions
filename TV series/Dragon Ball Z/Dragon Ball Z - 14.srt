00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,750
Goku kept on running down Snake
Way trying to find King Kai.

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,875
Unfortunately, an unexpected
detour lay just ahead.

4
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,875
After hitching a ride
with a street cleaner,

5
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,458
he caught some shut eye,

6
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,916
but a bump in the road sent him
hurtling into the underworld.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,666
Unaware of how he got
there or where he was,

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,916
he got an even
bigger surprise when

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,333
he met two
rambunctious ogres

10
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,500
who were eager
to play with him.

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,083
But there was no
time for games,

12
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,916
and Goku was eager to get back
on Snake Way any way he could.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,125
The ogres made him an
offer he couldn't refuse.

14
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,041
If he could beat them
in a competition

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,000
he would be allowed
to leave...

16
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,708
And sure enough, he did...

17
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Happy to win the grand
prize, as well as steal

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,625
some very special fruit that
gave him some extra strength,

19
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,541
Goku made a hasty exit.

20
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,958
But as everyone knows,
you can never trust an ogre!

21
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,416
Sure, Goku was allowed
to leave the underworld,

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,750
but he was sent right back
to where he started from...

23
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,458
To King Yemma's house!

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,375
Uh... hi there,
great King Yemma!

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,291
I thought you were
on Snake Way?

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,458
[GOKU] Uh, I am!
I mean, I was! I mean--

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,458
I should get going.
Bye, bye!

28
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,250
Hm. Goodness.
How strange.

29
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,333
[NARRATOR] Now Goku
has really got to hustle

30
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,791
if he wants to
find King Kai

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,500
and get that special martial
arts training he needs...

32
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,375
There are two Saiyans
on their way to earth

33
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,750
and he's got to get back
before they get there!

34
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,208
Let's hope that
he makes it!

35
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,500
[thinking] Good!
I think I'm almost back

36
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,458
to where I was
when I fell off!

37
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,833
Uh... Hm...
No-good hoodlum!

38
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,333
If that guy
doesn't slow down,

39
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,958
I'm going to have to clean him
off the back of this baby!

40
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,083
Hey! Slow down!

41
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Holy cow! That's that same
guy I ran into the other day.

42
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,416
Boy, I tell ya, that guy
should get a ticket

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
for reckless running!

44
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,041

Ouch...

[NARRATOR] While Goku gets
back on track, on Earth,

50
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,833
deep in the desert, Piccolo
is focusing his powers

51
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,375
and working on his own
special kind of training...

Wow! That's great!

[NARRATOR]
High atop Korin Tower,

65
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,458
the other members of the Z
warriors have gathered...

66
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,625
Eagerly they await their first
martial arts training session

67
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,000
with the one
and only Kami.

68
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm glad to see that you
two guys were called up.

69
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,833
This is great!
I'm totally psyched!

70
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,791
Me too! It'll be a treat! This
training should be excellent!

[KRILLIN]
Mm hmm!

72
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,666
[YAJIROBE] Nice crib!
I'll bet the food's good!

Man! King Yemma really
knows how to grow fruit!

76
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,125
I feel incredible!

77
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,375
I might make it to see King
Kai in time after all!

Huh? Wow. Check that
out. This must be it.

80
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,500
This place looks like
it's fit for a king,

81
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,958
but it doesn't seem
like anyone's home!

Ow! Man!

Summon the princess! A visitor
just dropped in to see her!

Huh? Huh?

00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,416
Excuse me, princess.
You have a visitor.

What? A visitor?
Really?

Yes, ma'am.

What fun! It's been so long!

93
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,500
Let's take a peek,
shall we? Hmm?

94
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
From what I can see,
he seems nice enough!

95
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,166
Let's get a better
look... Oh, my!

96
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,791
Ah...! Mmm, goody,
he's handsome, too!

97
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,458
Yes! I think I'd like to
meet this young gentleman!

98
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,375
Her highness
has arrived!

99
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,250
Uh...

100
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,541
Whoa! King Kai's
a woman?

101
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,541
Uh, sure enough!
And cute, too!

102
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,583
Oh! My, aren't
you bold!

103
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,291
[GOKU] Oh, sorry,
your highness!

104
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,083
I came here to study
with you, if that's okay?

105
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,375
Look at her highness!

106
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,666
I haven't seen
her so excited

107
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,666
since King Yemma dropped
by a long time ago.

108
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,875
Ah, what a
hunk of a man!

109
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,666
It's hard to believe a
thousand years have gone by

since he was
here last!

Okay, well...

The real reason I came here
is to receive your training

115
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,916
so I can help my
friends back on Earth!

flattered! Alright, then!

had any training before?

[thinking] Wow! This is
kinda strange!

121
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,125
So this is the famous
martial art of King Kai?

You're a natural! Next
time I'll let you lead!

Now I get it!
King Kai is testing me!

She wants me to find
the vulnerable moment

to her right now!

were King Kai. See you later.

Oh, yeah. It's been so long
since I've been hungry

because I ate that piece of

did! At dinner!

No, I didn't!

Oh, my dear,
perhaps it's true

333
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,208
that I wasn't able to deceive
your heart, but your eyes,

00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,750
what about your eyes? Have
they been deceived all along?

You poor blind fool.

[NARRATOR] For centuries,
outer space has been known

377
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:05,458
to be peaceful...
Until now...

378
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,291
On the outskirts of
the solar system,

379
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,166
two beings with
incredible powers

380
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,916
are on their way
to planet Earth.

381
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,375
And if they make it, they will
change our world forever...

382
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,666
That is, unless they
can be stopped!

383
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,666
Goku has escaped yet again
from another dangerous trap

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,583
and is back
on Snake Way.

He is still in the
running to save Earth,

00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,875
but first he must
find King Kai.

387
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,250
He needs to learn a special
kind of martial arts

388
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,500
that only the
King can provide.

But the Saiyan warriors
are getting closer,

390
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,666
and the clock is
ticking towards

391
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,750
the day of
their arrival.

392
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,708
The Z warriors have made
it to Kami's place,

393
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,416
and are busy training for
their inevitable meeting

394
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,166
with the
deadly duo...

395
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,500
But will they have
they strength

396
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,208
to face them
in battle?

397
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,458
Or is Goku our
only chance?
