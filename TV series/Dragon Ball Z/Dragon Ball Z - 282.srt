00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,000
it was Majin verses
Saiyan, as the battle

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,125
that would decide the fate
of the Universe raged on.

4
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,333
[NARRATOR]
It was a trial of pain for Goku,

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,750
but the darker it got,
the brighter his light shined.

6
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:34,041
And in classic style,
he countered Buu's every attack.

7
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,250
[NARRATOR]
But as the battle wore on,

8
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,500
Goku felt the power needed to
destroy Buu slipping away.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,333
[GOKU growls]
I should have done it.

10
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,666
Darn it, now I'm weak.
I'll need time.

11
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,791
I havee got it covered,
Kakarot. Sixty seconds.

12
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,500
Get what you need,
and finish him off.

13
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,750
[NARRATOR]
One minute.

14
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,958
That's how long Vegeta
had to keep Buu occupied

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,000
so Goku could gather the
energy needed to destroy him.

16
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,208
But in this fight, one minute
can seem an eternity.

17
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,416
Has the Saiyan Prince
reached the end of his rope?

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Stay tuned to find out.

What's going on?

21
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,250
I should have been able
to gather all the energy

22
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,708
I need by now.

[OLD KIA] I know it's
difficult to watch, son,

39
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,500
but you can't leave now.

40
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,666
[KABITO KAI] It's not that, Sir.
I've decided to go home.

41
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,750
What? Are you crazy?

42
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,791
I know Buu's strength is
vastly superior to my own,

43
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,875
that fact has been proven
on more than one occasion,

44
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,333
but I think I can at
least stand up to him

45
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,375
long enough to give
Goku a little extra time.

46
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,833
I can't stand by and watch again
like I did all those years ago,

47
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,458
when Majin Buu first
attacked my fellow Kais.

48
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,666
Even if I can only
buy one extra second,

49
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,000
it'll be worth it.

50
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,208
[OLD KAI]
Wait a minute.

51
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[DENDE]
Yeah, wait. I'm coming, too.

52
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,791
Uh? You, too?

53
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,875
I'm no fighter,

54
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
but if I can manage
to stay alive,

55
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
my healing powers
might come in handy.

56
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,750
Are you sure?

57
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,791
[DENDE]
Yes, sir. I'm positive.

58
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:36,375
I'm willing to take the chance
if it means helping Goku. Hm.

59
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,666
Outstanding.

60

Just a second. Not so fast.

65
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,291
Look, I know you both
want to help,

66
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,000
and I very much
admire your courage,

67
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,250
but if you show up now
that's just two more people

68
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,750
Goku has to worry about.

69
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,000
Please, don't go yet.

70

I know how you must feel,

71
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,125
but we have to trust
in Goku's judgment.

72
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,791
Let's be patient, and let
him and Vegeta handle this.

73
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,375
I still believe those two
know what they're doing.

74
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,000
It's hard to watch them suffer,

75
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,041

this is what they live for.

[OLD KAI] Can either of you
tell me what's going on?

Well, sort of.

171
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,500
I know the original Majin Buu
was friends with Mister Satan,

172
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,750
until he split and was absorbed
by the newer, evil form.

173
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,166
He must've still been
inside evil Buu's body,

174
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,083
and he kept him
from harming Mr. Satan.

175
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,416
So the evil Buu
spit the good Buu out

176
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,708
like a piece of
used-up chewing gum.

177
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,208
That means he'll
attack Mr. Satan now,

178
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,833
but I guess it doesn't
really matter at this point.

179
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,583

a few serious character flaws,

that's for sure,

181
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,833
but as fate would have it,
he's the last human alive.
