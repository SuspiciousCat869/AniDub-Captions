00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,875
Evil rained down upon
an unsuspecting Earth!

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,625
And the quiet of
a peaceful morning

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,375
in the city
was shattered,

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,666
as two Saiyan space
pods came crashing

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,291
to the
planet's surface!

7
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,291
After a year-long
journey through space,

8
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,541
the dreaded Saiyan warriors
have finally arrived!

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
And the Earth's
greatest defenders

10
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,666
are ready to
meet them...

11
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,166
Goku's friends have
already used the power

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,458
of the Dragon Balls to restore
the fallen hero back to life.

13
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,375
And with his super-charged
strength and speed,

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,583
he has launched into the
two-day trip down Snake Way!

15
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,000
Every second counts.

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,666
Over a day still remains
in Goku's journey.

17
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,458
But the Saiyans
attack... Today!

18
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,958
Alien!

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:07,791
[WOMAN gasps]

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,625
Oh, my...
Incredible...

21
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,708
[MAN 2]
He's getting out!

22
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,250
[NAPPA] So what should we do
with these gawking fools!

23
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,500
They bother me!

24
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,333
[MAN (BLUE SUIT)]
Wh-Who are they?

25
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,041
[MAN (BASEBALL CAP)]
What are they?!

26
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,375
Oh, I don't know.

27
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,666
Why don't you decide for once?

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,791
Heh! Really? Thanks, Vegeta.

29
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,500
This is going to be
a lot of fun for me.

30
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,750
[VEGETA chuckles]

31
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
Don't mention it.

32
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,125
[NAPPA]
Heh, heh, heh...

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,750
[CROWD screams]

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:02,375
[NAPPA laughs]

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,125
[CHIAOTZU yells]

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,416
[TIEN]
Try to hold on!

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,458
What are they...
What are they doing?!

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,625
This is intense!

39
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,750
[NAPPA laughs]

40
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,875
Do you think I was trying too
hard to impress them, Vegeta?

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,333
There isn't anyone
left to impress, Nappa.

42
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,625
I should have known better
than to let you have any fun.

43
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,833
But why?

44
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,166
Hey, c'mon! A little
destruction won't effect

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,041
the sale price of this planet.
What's the big deal?

46
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,500
Try to use
your brain...

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,416
We came here for the Dragon
Balls, remember, for the wish.

48
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,166
You remember the wish,
don't you, Nappa?

49
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,791
[NAPPA] Well, yeah,
we were going to wish for

50
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,166
immortality, weren't we?

51
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,583
Good, and we need all
seven balls, right?

52
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,916
So let me ask you...

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,625
What if one of the
balls happened to be in

54
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,333
the city you
just destroyed?

55
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm sorry. I guess I just
forgot about that, huh?

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,833
[VEGETA] Well, let's
both forget about it.

57
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,916
What's done
cannot be undone.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,583
Now, first we
need to find out

59
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,791
who has the highest
power level.

60
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,000
He'll be the one who
finished off Raditz.

61
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,625
[NAPPA] Huh? More than
half-a-dozen people

62
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:45,916
on this planet have power
levels over a thousand!

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,666
How is that possible?

64
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,208
How should I know?

65
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,500
Maybe they've been preparing
for us... Not to worry.

66
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,333
Let's start out by finding
the strongest one.

67
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,833
[NAPPA] Hm.

68
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,791
[NAPPA] I just found
two of them.

69
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,875
They definitely have the
highest fighting power

70
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,333
on the planet.

71
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Really? Good then. This may
be interesting after all.

72
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,875
[caws]

73
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,250
[ANNOUNCER] To repeat...

74
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,416
An unknown force of
devastating power

75
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,250
has completely destroyed
all of East City.

76
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,125
Government officials have
ruled out the possibility

77
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,291
of foreign
acts of war.

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,666
There were no
earthquakes in the area,

79
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,166
but noted physicists
have said

80
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
that the bright white light
that surrounded the city

81
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,291
could have been caused by
a multi-dimensional shift.

82
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,458
Well, the day has
finally arrived.

83
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,083
C'mon, let's go
help the others.

84
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,291
I can tell you
where they are!

85
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,041
What? Are you crazy?
What are we going to do?

86
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,333
[BULMA] Oolong!
You're such a coward!

87
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,041
Yeah! We're
going to help!

88
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,166
You just tell us what to do,
Master Roshi, and we'll do it!

89
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Sorry, gang.
Oolong's right.

90
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,041
--[OOLONG] Huh?
--[BULMA] What?!

91
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,875
I'm afraid
it's true.

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,333
This sort of battle is just
way out of our league.

93
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,208
We'd only get in the
way of the others'

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,208
if we were there
with them.

95
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,333
Yeah, I guess so.

96
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,500
[OOLONG]
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

97

Oh my goodness!

do it! Hold on!

Heh! Amazing! This
planet's weak gravity

103
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,375
makes me feel like a kid
again. I'm invincible!

104
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,541
It's time!
Man are they movin'!

105
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,333
All right! Well, at that speed
it won't take them very long

106
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,416
to get to Piccolo
and Gohan!

107
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,041
Goku, you better
hurry up and get back!

108
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,125
You know how much I hate
fighting without you.

headed straight for us!

you just stay here?

No way! I'm coming! I didn't
train so hard for nothing!

Besides, I'm
sticking with you!

[helicopter blades whir]

115
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,750
I can't believe it!
There's nothing left!

All right! Let's move it!

Say something, Ed!

118
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,708
[CREW MAN 1] It's reading a
little hot. It's safe though.

119
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,708
As you can see,
East City is gone.

120
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,916
Only a crater remains where
the great city once stood.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,083
How and why the city
vanished earlier today

122
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,750
remains a mystery...

Any guesses yet, Sir?

[INSPECTOR DOG]
I'm afraid not.

125
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,666
At this point, we're
completely baffled.

126

[YAJIROBE] Yeah, well
I know what happened!

to help fight 'em.

For the last time!

just who are they?

it somewhere else?

He said guys thought
you couldn't fight

255
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,750
because you
were so short.

Short, huh? Actually,
we were the same size.

growing and I stopped.

By the way.

from Namek all right.

hard time with him and Kakarot.

something before now!

and pointy ears

are a dead give away,
don't you think?

So, I'm from the planet Namek!

same time, I know it's true!

about the Dragon Balls!

Where are they?

where they are!

Not for a whole year!

That's enough. We know
the balls are down here!

Make no mistake!

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,625
We will find them with you
alive or with you dead!

310
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,958
It's your decision!

Tell us where they are
or you will all be killed!

Because of you, I now know that
I come from the planet Namek.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,125
But, this is
my planet now!

315
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,375
And no one is going to tell
me what to do with it!

316
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,833
So, back off! We're not here
to bow down to your demands!

317
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,500
We're here to fight!

318
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,833
So go ahead and do whatever
it is you came here to do!

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Are you okay?

320
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,666
Yes... I'm fine,
Mr. Popo.

321
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,625
For the first time in my life
I have heard about my origin.

322
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:15,375
Now I know the reason why I
have always had special powers.

323
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,666
You see, they just
said I'm from space...

324
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,500
A place
called Namek.

325
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,208
It all makes sense.

326
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,625
When I created the Dragon Balls
I fulfilled a deep yearning.

327
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,041
The blueprints for the balls
existed in my mind and heart

328
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,416
long before I was
able to give them form.

329
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,666
When I finally succeeded, I
felt as if I had made it home.

330
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,791
Or rather, as if
a piece of home,

331
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,708
had found its
way to me.

332
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,666
[helicopter blades whir]

333
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,958
Huh?

334
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
[NAPPA yells]

335
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,041
[CAMERA MAN]
Let's get out of here!

336
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
[VEGETA] I guess they're
not going to tell us

337
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,333
where the Dragon
Balls are, Nappa.

338
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,041
[NAPPA]
You wanna bet?

339
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,166
Alright! Let's see how
strong you really are!

340
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,958
[beeping]

341
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,750
[NAPPA] The kid's
at a thousand.

342
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,791
The Namek is at
fourteen hundred,

343
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,833
and the midget's
at eleven hundred.

344
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,333
You fools! Do you really
think you can beat us

345
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,375
with such puny
power levels?

346
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,500
Hey, Nappa...

347
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,208
Take your
Scouter off.

348
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,458
[NAPPA] What?

349
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,458
It seems they know how
to concentrate energy

350
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,291
and raise their
fighting powers.

351
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,416
These figures
are most unreliable.

352
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,583
Hey, right, good call!
Now I remember.

353
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,875
That pathetic loser, Raditz, 
let himself be fooled

354
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,625
by all of their
power readings.

355
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,625
You two be
ready for them!

356
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,083
Wait, Piccolo, if they're
stronger than Raditz,

357
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,416
and Goku isn't here,

358
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,208
how can you expect to
defeat them with just us?

359
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,750
[grunts]

360
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh, well, guys...
Let's just do it.

361
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Nappa, I believe it's time
we have a little fun with them.

362
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,500
Better yet, get
those Saibamen out.

363
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,166
There should be six of
them left... They'll do.

364
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,708
You're too much! You really
know how to have fun!

365
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,125
Huh? Saibamen?

366
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,041
I don't see
any men.

367
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,875
You're right,
there are six.

368
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,041
Maybe the Saibamen
can persuade them

369
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,791
to tell us where the Dragon
Balls are, huh, Nappa?

370
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,333
[NAPPA laughs]

371
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,125
Oh, I think they
can arrange that.

372
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,500
Uh, okay, what
are they doing?

373
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,416
[PICCOLO] I think we're
about to find out.

374
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,666
There.

375
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,833
Ah!

376
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,333
[VEGETA laughs]

377
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,750
[NAPPA chuckles]

378
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Well, at least...
they're shorter than I am!

379
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:29,458
[SAIBAMEN growl]

380
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,916
[snarling]

381
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,416
[snarling]

382
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
[snarling]

383
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,666
They're brainless,
crazy monsters!

384
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,666
They're strong, too.

385
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,375
This should be a
pretty good match up.

386
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,041
These Saibamen
seem spunky.

387
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,458
[KRILLIN] I'll take
the two on the left!

388
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,541
[PICCOLO] I've got
the two in the middle.

389
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,208
The two on the
right are yours, Gohan!

390
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,208
[GOHAN] Okay!

391
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,916
[NARRATOR] Will these
sprouted Saiyan spawn

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
prove to be more than
our heroes can handle?

393
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,791
Or will they somehow
be able to withstand

394
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,833
the onslaught long enough
for Goku to return?

395
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,000
With the fate of the entire
world in the balance,

396
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,958
Goku's help can't
come fast enough...

397
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:55,000
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
