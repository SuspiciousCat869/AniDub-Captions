00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,041
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,791
Goku was stranded
on the planet Namek

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,500
when it exploded and
was blown to smithereens!

5
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,416
[NARRATOR]
But Bulma wasn't worried,

6
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
because she found out that
the Dragon Balls from Namek

7
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,708
possessed certain
advantages that

8
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,541
the Earth's
Dragon Balls didn't have!

9
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,166
Goku, Krillin, and Chiaotzu
can all be wished back!

10
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,041
[NARRATOR] King Kai, however,
was less than enthusiastic.

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,958
[KING KAI] Using the Nameks'
Dragon Balls is a great idea,

12
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,750
but I'm afraid it won't
help Goku and Krillin.

13
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,083
[YAMCHA and CHIAOTZU] Huh?

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,083
He brings them back to
the place where they died!

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
Goku and Krillin died on Namek.

16
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,333
They would materialize in space.

17
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,083
Right where Namek used to be!

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,958
[NARRATOR] Is there any hope
to bring our heros back?

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,250
Find out, today!

20

[birds chirping]

21
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,625
[BULMA] Gosh, Goku...

22
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,458
Hey, there's got to be a way.

23
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,708
We just can't give up.
Whadda ya think?

24
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
[BULMA] I don't know, Gohan.

25
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,750
King Kai was
pretty clear on the matter.

26
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,333
It's no problem
to wish Chiaotzu back

27
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,250
because he died on Earth.

28
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,458
But I'm afraid it's a
completely different matter

29
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,916
with your dad and Krillin.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,083
There's no nest
to lay the eggs in!

31
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,916
Hey, that's a good analogy!

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, sure.

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,333
[BULMA] Your dad
and Krillin are the eggs

34
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,750
and the Dragon is the hen,

35
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,750
but there's no nest
for her to lay her eggs in!

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,916
And since there's not
a cozy space for the eggs,

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,291
they get cold and crack,

38
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,333
and the little chickies
end up dying.

39
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,125
That's awful. Gosh!

40
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,208
[BULMA] I'm sorry, Gohan.
I know it's hard.

41
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,250
Your dad's a really good egg.

42
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,166
--[VEGETA] Shut up!
--[BULMA] Wha--?!

ridiculous babble!

[gasps]

45
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
If you want Kakarot back,
then listen.

46
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,333
The Earth has a Check-in
Station to the spirit realm.

47
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,916
Wish him back there first.
Then wish him back to life.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,833
Hey! That might work!

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,208
[BULMA] Man, Vegeta! What a
great idea! I'm impressed!

[BULMA] This is awesome!

52
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
We need to gather
the Dragon Balls!

I'm not interested
in helping Kakarot.

00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,833
I want to know how
he became a Super Saiyan,

62
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,708
so I can do it too!

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
[MOORI]
Excuse me, Miss Bulma.

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,916
We have a request
we'd like to make.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We plan to use our Dragon Balls
to relocate to another planet.

66
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,291
But finding a suitable
home is going to take time.

67
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,125
Do you know of a place
where we can stay temporarily

68
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,958
until we can make
other arrangements.

00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
[BULMA] Gosh...

00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,916
Hey, I know! Just stay with me!

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,833
No. We mustn't impose.

00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,375
Aw, hey,
it's really no biggie.

73
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,291
It's the least
I can do for you all.

74
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,333
Besides, you need a major
credit card to stay in a hotel.

Huh?

[BULMA] Hey, no worries.
My dad's compound is huge.

There's enough room
for everyone.

It's not like you guys
have a lot of options.

All right, gang,
everything is a go!

Now remember,
when you first take-off

One hundred and thirty days

160
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,916
seemed to pass by very quickly,

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,958
and it was time to summon
the Eternal Dragon once again.

162
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,750
Gosh, are you guys ever lucky.

163
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,875
Our Dragon Balls take a
whole year to regenerate.

164
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,375
Ours too. We Nameks just have
shorter year than you all do.

165
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,833
Oh. Gotcha! Well,
what do you guys think?

166
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,916
I say we should we call
upon the Eternal Dragon

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,250
while we're still young.

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,750
Are you up to it?

169
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,750
Sure, why not?!
But... where's... Gohan?

170
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,541
[CHICHI]
Hey! Hold on! Wait for us!

171

Hey! What's up, kid?

172
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,041
[GOHAN] Not a lot!

173
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,041
Sorry we're late.
I had to finish my homework.

[BULMA] Don't sweat it, kid.

You're fashionably late
and that's okay.

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,750
Gohan's been hitting
the books a lot lately.

177
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,000
He's almost caught up
on all the work he missed

Because he is alive.

he would die.

00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,458
I'll bet he cheated.

321
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey, Dende. Yamcha's our man.

322
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,416
[speaking Namekian]

323
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,833
[PORUNGA growls]

324
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,833
So be it.

325
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,541
[PORUNGA] It is done.
Your wish has been granted.

326
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,708
It has? But where is he?

327
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,375
[PORUNGA] I have
fulfilled three wishes.

328
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,333
I am finished here.

329
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,583
Uh, no! Wait! Please!

330
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,208
[growls]

331
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh man! Bummer...!

332
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
The Dragon short-changed us!

333
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
No he didn't! I'm over here!

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,625
[chuckles nervously]

335
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,500
Ribbit, ribbit!

336
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,958
Yamcha! I missed you!

337
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,500
[laughs]

338
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,375
Puar, easy!

339
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,541
[PUAR]
You're really back!

340
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,083
[BULMA] Yamcha...?

341
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,708
Hey! Wow! You're looking
better than ever, Bulma!

342
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,541
I missed you a lot!

343
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,416
[NARRATOR] One hundred
and thirty days later,

344
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,166
on a sunny afternoon,

345
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,333
a peculiar darkness
overtook the sky once again!

346
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,458
The first wish was
used to bring back

347
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,958
the young Emperor, Chiaotzu.

348
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,208
[cheering and laughing]

349
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:51,041
[NARRATOR] With the next wish,
Tien was brought back.

350
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Huh?

351
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,666
Are we, uh...?

352
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
Mm.

353
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,208
[CHIAOTZU] Oh, Tien! I can't
believe it! We're home!

354
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,208
[sobbing]

355
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,708
[clapping and cheering]

356
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,291
[growls]

357
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,333
[giggles]

358
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,958
Well, Dende...

359
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,125
It's time to say good-bye.

360
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,708
[DENDE] Yes, sir.

361
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,708
Good-bye, friends.
We love each of you.

362
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,458
Gosh! You're so sweet.

363
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,916
Gohan. I'm sorry, but I
have to say good-bye now.

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,708
Gosh, Dende.

365
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,791
I promise, I'll never
forget you, Gohan.

366
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,375
All right.
Let's have it already.

367
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,625
[DENDE speaking Namekian]

368
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,750
See ya!

369
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,041
Yeah, see ya!

370
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,958
Gohan...

371
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,666
Bye!

372
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,916
Dende!

373
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,041
[NARRATOR]
And so the star-voyagers

374
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,416
from the planet Namek
left the Earth

375
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
to begin life a new
somewhere deep in space!

376
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,083
[OX-KING] ChiChi, is that
meat loaf I smell?

377
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,958
[CHICHI] Yes, Dad.
It's meat loaf.

378
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,125
Mmm! Yummy! I love meat loaf!

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,708
[PICCOLO] If you ever
need me, Gohan...

380
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll be there for you, kid.

381
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,791
[NARRATOR] At long last,
life returned to normal

382
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,708
for Gohan and his family.

383
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,458
Except that every night,

384
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,375
they would go out and
look at the stars together,

385
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,791
and wonder when the one they
loved would finally return!
