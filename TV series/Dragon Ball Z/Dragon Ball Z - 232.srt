00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,916
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,208
energy clashed against energy

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,166
in the remote
fighting ground where

4
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,416
Goku and Vegeta
continued their duel,

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,875
a battle that had brewed
in the Saiyan Prince

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,958
for nearly a decade.

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,458
Vegeta, I don't understand.

8
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,791
You've never allowed anyone to
help you before in your life.

9
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,625
Why start now? Why Babidi?

10
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,083
[NARRATOR] And Vegeta revealed
he'd intentionally fallen

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,333
under Babidi's spell.

12
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,583
Just to gain more strength.

13
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,250
I was the perfect warrior!
Cold and ruthless!

14
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:52,000
I lived by my strength alone!
Uninhibited by foolish emotion!

15
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,166
Huh?!

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,125
[VEGATA roars]

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,833
[NARRATOR] And so the
struggle wages forward

18
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,833
with Vegeta's rampage of hate

19
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,291
perhaps too strong
for even Goku to stop.

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,875
[NARRATOR] But the fight
between the Saiyans

21
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,625
has left unexpected
consequences.

22
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,708
[NARRATOR]
Absorbing the enormous energy

23
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,708
that Goku had lost
in his fight...

24
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,875
The seal around
Buu was finally broken.

25
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,166
[NARRATOR] And unless
Gohan can act quickly,

26
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,250
the Supreme Kai's careful
plan will end in failure.

27
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:35,375
Ooo! It's really happening!
Majin Buu is at full power!

28
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,541
[laughs]

29
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,291
[NARRATOR]
Because now, the magic creature

30
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,000
that nearly destroyed
the universe

31
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:44,083
centuries ago is ready
for a second try.

32
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:05,125
[rythmic pulse sound]

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,625
[hysteric laughter]

34
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,125
[laughs]

35
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:13,583
[BABIDI chuckles]

36
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,083
Dabura, he's coming
out! It's really real!

37
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,833
Yes, Master!

38
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,250
He's going to come
out and when he does,

39
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,666
Everybody's going to run
around and suffer 'til they die!

40
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,958
My father will be avenged
by his own creation,

41
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,166
and I'm the one who
made it all possible!

42
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, you do him a great honor.

43
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,541
You have no idea how long
I've waited for this!

44
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,500
Counting down minutes
for centuries!

45
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:46,208
[BABIDI giggles]

46
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,250
Ahh! Ohhh! Ahhh!

47
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,833
[grunts]

48
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,416
[GOHAN thinking] Dad's energy
has gone beyond Super Saiyan.

49
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,166
Guess he had to do
it to stop Vegeta.

50
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,208
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

51
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,208
[GOHAN thinking]
But their stupid fighting

52
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,000
is gonna make this
Buu thing hatch!

53
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,791
Too late we must
retreat and quickly.

54
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,375
Huh?

55
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,375
We have no choice,
Run when I signal!

56
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,208
Wait! We've got to try and stop
this thing before it hatches

57
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,625
and starts hurting people!

58
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,041
There must be a way!

59
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,125
I mean, you are the Supreme Kai
for goodness sakes!

60
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,541
Yes, and unlike you I've
seen what Buu is capable of!

61
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,166
And it's more than
our present state can handle!

62
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,583
This is a time for strategy,
Gohan, not blind heroics!

63
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,416
We must regroup and
wait for a better opportunity!

64
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,250
We have to wait!

65
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,333
I'm sorry, but
I still have to try.

66
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,791
Please listen to me Gohan!
We need you alive!

67
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,666
But there's people I care about!

68
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,958
Gohan!

69
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,625
[growls]

70
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,125
And this time around,

71
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm not going to just stand by
and let them all get hurt.

72
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:11,833
Hyaaaaagh!!

73
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,541
There's no stopping him!

74
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,541
Now what do you
suppose got into that one?

75
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,875
Fool!

76
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:33,625
Well at least I'll make
them work for it Ka-me...

77
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,791
[GOHAN]
...ha-me..

78
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,291
Haaa!

79
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,041
[gasps]

80
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,333
No!

81
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:19,166
Ka-me-ha-me HA!

82
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,875
Amazing!

83
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,083
Hold on Trunks! Hold on!

84
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,791
Huh? What, Goten?

85
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,791
[GOTEN] Something over
there feels really weird...

86
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,833
Do you think that could be
where the grown-ups are at?

87
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,416
[TRUNKS]
Yeah, but that's weird.

88
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,625
I still feel something from up
ahead of us, too. Don't you?

89
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,875
Uh-huh.

90
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,750
So which way is right?

91
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,166
Man! I wish they would have
left us some directions!

92
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:11,000
[GOTEN]
Whoa! Birdies! [laughs]

93
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,333
Why so many?

94
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,875
They sound kind
of frightened to me.

95
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,666
I don't know what
scared birds sound like

96
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,375
but I bet they're coming
from some kind of trouble.

97
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,666
Oh...

98
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,166
[TRUNKS] And that means
we know which way to go.

99
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:33,291
[frightened screams]

100
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,666
Why are they all running away?

101
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,875
Well...

102
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,708
[MR. SATAN]
Don't they know I'm here?

103
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,750
Well you didn't
exactly stop that guy

104
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,916
from blowing up
the arena earlier.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,208
But...

106
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,166
Yeah it's a pity things had to
end like this sort of a downer.

107
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,375
I mean we didn't even have time
to give you the prize money.

108
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,708
Hey! Cheer up!

109
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,666
I say we continue the ceremonies
to keep up the morale!

110
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,166
Start by giving me the money!

111
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,291
Well I would but no one's
paying attention right now.

112
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,000
Hey! Everybody!

113
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,416
If you're looking
for a safe place,

114
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,166
then you're running
in the wrong direction!

115
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,625
You're under the
watchful eye of Mr. Satan!

116
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,375
Proven champion for all that
is good! Guardian of the world!

117
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,333
That's right! It's Mr. Satan!

118
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:41,708
[cheering]

119
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:58,041
[MR. SATAN]
Yaaaaah!! Haha!

120
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,375
[MR. SATAN thinking]
That's better.

121
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,916
Now I can get my cash
and hurry back home.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,250
It's dangerous around here.

123
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:11,458
Hmmm... I'm feeling very strange
disturbances in the distance.

124
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,500
Can't tell what it is, exactly,
but it doesn't belong.

125
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,916
If things are wrong

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,208
then I just know Goku and
Gohan are mixed up in it!

127
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,916
And my little Goten
is missing too

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,083
and nobody can tell me anything!

129
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,000
What is going on?

130
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,916
This isn't helping, ChiChi!

131
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,125
Curse that boy.

132
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,583
Master, we must stop
this interference

133
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,583
before he ruins the hatching.

134
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,708
Oh, let him have
his fun, Dabura!

135
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:20,416
That level of attack is like
a flea bite to Majin Buu!

136
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:31,458
There! You see?! All that and
he can't even budge it one bit!

137
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,291
Haaaaaa!

138
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,541
Ah!

139
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,416
Hmm?

140
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,208
Oh!

141
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,583
Uh...

142
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,750
Here goes.

143
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,000
Ka-me-ha-me HAA!

144
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,916
Oooh! We did it!
He's really alive!

145
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,041
Our time has come.

146
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,416
It's empty!

147
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,083
Huh?

148
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:08,166
But... how? I did
everything correctly...

149
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,958
Followed every step...
Said every word...

150
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,166
Come out! Yes, come out
and destroy them all, Buu!

151
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,250
We're all waiting!

152
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:31,416
[SUPREME KAI laughs]

153
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
All your efforts, for nothing!

154
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,041
You've made a
fatal mistake, Babidi!

155
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,583
Just like your father!
Fooled by overconfidence!

156
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,250
Underestimated
your opponents!

157
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,083
And so this Earthling has
destroyed your sacred Buu!

158
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,791
Years of captivity in that shell
must have made him defenseless.

159
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:55,625
And not even the energy from
this planet could revive him!

160
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,541
Now.. the story of
Buu finally comes to an end.

161
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,500
Don't let that old
fool discourage you Babidi

162
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:08,208
even without Buu we can
still continue our plan.

163
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,416
And I'm sure that
with a little persuasion

164
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
the Saiyan Prince
could be put

165
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,458
more completely
under your control.

166
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,916
Oh it's no use!
Don't you understand?

167
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,791
There isn't any
plan without Buu!

168
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,500
To think I'd see the great
wizard of evil brought to tears!

169
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,458
Hahahahahaha!

170
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,583
Well galactic
domination may be ruled out

171
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,000
but what do you say we get rid
of this annoying Supreme Kai?

172
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,500
Sure. [chuckles]

173
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,708
[SUPREME KAI] All right
Gohan, let's work together

174
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,333
and put an end to this entire
ordeal as quickly as we can.

175
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,625
I'll get Babidi
to the ground

176
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,583
and prevent him from
casting his spells.

177
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,541
That way you can fight
Dabura without distraction.

178
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,291
I hope you realize the
significance of this day, Gohan!

179
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,083
You've released
your full powers

180
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,250
just like your father said
and now look what its done!

181
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,375
We're only one battle away

182
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,625
from bringing everything
back to normal!

183
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,708
No, Supreme Kai... We're not.

184
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,875
Huh?!

185
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,041
My last attack still
wasn't strong enough

186
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,000
to destroy the energy
I felt in there.

187
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,416
There's something... Huh?!

188
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:23,250
But, I don't sense
anything, Gohan! It can't be!

189
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,833
All I know is that something
did come out of that shell

190
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,166
and it's up there now!

191
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,500
Dabura...
What is the boy looking at?

192
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,791
[DABURA] Clouds...
No, it's some kind of smoke.

193
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,250
I can't feel anything
from it but emptiness.

194
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,583
[SUPREME KAI]
But what is it?

195
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,166
Hyaaargh!

196
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,833
[GOKU thinking]
His moves are incredible!

197
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,416
[VEGETA thinking] Finally,
I'm going to rip him apart!

198
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,583
Hyaaaaaa!

199
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,458
Ugh!!

200
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,375
[snickers]

201
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,500
[GOKU chuckles]

202
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,750
I'm getting a terrible feeling.

203
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,458
Hey look!
Something's forming!

204
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,416
I'm beginning to detect...

205
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,875
Aaah!

206
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Buu!

207
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,791
Awww...

208
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:18,500
Tell me, Master. Is this the...
the great Majin Buu?

209
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,708
[BABIDI]
Well...

210
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,791
To tell you the truth
I'm not quite sure.

211
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,791
See. The only person
who's actually seen Buu

212
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,708
is that annoying rat,
Kai, over there.

213
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,041
So, what's the
verdict, Supreme Kai?

214
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,250
Is this the guy
you're so afraid of?

215
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,250
Yes, that's Bibidi's
creation without a doubt.

216
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,333
I could never forget that
disgusting creature's face.

217
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,375
[gasps]

218
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:50,375
Oooh! Look how scared
the Kai is! It must be him!

219
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,083
Are you positive?

220
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,750
Hey! Majin Buu! Come to me!

221
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,541
[GOHAN] Strange...
The way you talked

222
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,166
I thought he'd be much larger.

223
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,500
[SUPREME KAI] I can't bear to
look at him! We have to retreat!

224
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm not so sure about that.

225
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,875
You may have been
right about him weakening

226
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,583
from his years in captivity.

227
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,000
He's obviously tough, but
I don't think he's unbeatable.

228
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,708
Wha... But don't you sense
his power? His strength?!

229
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,500
Yeah... But I'm also
well aware of what I can do.

230
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,166
[gasps]

231
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,333
Buu!

232
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,583
Buu!

233
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,791
[BUU giggles]

234
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, ho haha. Woop.

235
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:14,166
[BUU hums]

236
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,958
Ohhhh...

237
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,333
That's right Buu,
come to your master!

238
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,500
[giggles]

239
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,500
Uh...

240
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,041
[BABIDI]
Hey... Where are you going?

241
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:39,666
[pants]

242
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,750
[grunts] Hyaargh!

243
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,583
Hey! Wait a second!

244
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,458
[VEGETA]
Huh?!

245
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,208
I just felt a
tremendous surge of energy!

246
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
While we've been
fighting each other,

247
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,041
that Buu creature must
have been hatched!

248
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,583
[pants]

249
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,333
[growls]

250
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,333
[BUU laughs]

251
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,083
Whooa! Woop. Woop. Woop.

252
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,083
Woooo....

253
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,458
Buu... Buu...

254
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,083
Buu! [laughs]

255
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,750
[NARRATOR]
At long last,

256
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,958
despite the heroic efforts
of the Z Fighters,

257
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,208
Buu has been unleashed!

258
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,083
But does this pudgy,
pink, infant-like creature

259
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,208
really have the power to
put the planet in jeopardy?

260
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:52,500
Don't miss the next
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

261
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,625
Buu!
