00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,291
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:22,750
Vegeta reduced Android 19
to scrap metal.

3
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,416
The advanced,
robotic humanoid

4
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,541
with artificial intelligence
was no match

5
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,291
for the Super Saiyan Prince.

6
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,083
Even the superior Android 20
model decided to run for cover

7
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,458
rather than fight
Vegeta head on.

8
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,791
[NARRATOR] Suddenly it was no
longer a battle of raw strength

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,375
but a tactical game
of hide and seek.

10
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,750
[VEGETA] Darn!
How could I?!

11
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,625
A mistake like that
is inexcusable!

12
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,333
[NARRATOR] Lurking just above,
but unable to be sensed,

13
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,875
was the crafty Android 20.

14
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,291
[ANDROID 20 chuckles]

15
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,875
His frustration
is apparent.

16
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,208
He's no longer the cool,
confident fighter

17
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,375
that he was before.

18
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,250
[NARRATOR] Though
outmatched in strength,

19
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,500
the diabolical Android 20
decided to stalk the others

20
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,166
and quietly take what he
needed from them.

21
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,500
[NARRATOR] Unaware
that the deadly predator

22
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,916
was watching them, Gohan,
Tien, Krillin and Piccolo

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,666
continued their search.

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,375
Little did they know, they were
walking right into an ambush.

25
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,625
I will steal the energy from
these pathetic fools one by one!

26
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,875
Then Vegeta is mine!

victims to choose from.

it's you guys, huh?

36

Oh, man! I'm too tense...

37
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,583
[thinking] Where
the heck did he go?!

38
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,250
Oh, man...

39
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,541
With my luck, I'll be
the one that finds him.

40
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,000
Just watch...

41
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,416

hurt if I'm not careful!

Uhh, namely me...

47
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,291
I'm really on edge.

48
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,416
I'd rather just fight
and get it over with!

49

[ANDROID 20 chuckles]

54
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,125
[ANDROID 20] Piccolo is the
strongest next to Vegeta!

55
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,833
Perfect! He is
definitely the one.

56
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,791
Ah, yes, victory
will soon be mine!

57

me all the energy I need.
