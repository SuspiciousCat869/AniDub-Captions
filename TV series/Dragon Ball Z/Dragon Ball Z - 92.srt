1
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,458
[GOKU yells]

2
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,250
Goku had mounted
what looked like

4
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,166
a final assault against Frieza.

5
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,375
[GOKU] Mark my words,
I'm going to win this fight!

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,500
So get ready, Frieza,

7
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,208
'cause this time,
you're going down!

8
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,625
[NARRATOR] Firing up his
Twenty Times Kaio-Ken,

9
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,375
Goku turned into a
Saiyan cannon ball,

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,083
aimed directly at Frieza!

11
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,041
[NARRATOR] A quick
jab with the left...

12
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,708
A mean hook
with the right...

13
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,041
[GOKU] Kamehame-Haa!

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,125
[NARRATOR] And Goku threw
Frieza against the ropes

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,291
with his powerful Kamehameha.

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,583
[NARRATOR] Frieza tried his
hardest to stop the blast,

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,958
but not even he could keep
this bomb from going off.

18
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,708
[NARRATOR] At last,
the evil lizard

19
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,791
had a taste of his own medicine.

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,541
[NARRATOR] For a moment,
it looked as if Goku

21
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,666
had actually destroyed
Frieza, once and for all.

22
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,416
[NARRATOR] The universe
was safe again.

23
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,416
[NARRATOR] But when
the smoke cleared,

24
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,208
Frieza was still standing,
virtually untouched!

25
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:42,250
[NARRATOR] Another round between
Goku and Frieza begins... today!

26
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,208
[KRILLIN] Oh no...

27
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,333
The Twenty Times
Kaio-Ken didn't work!

28
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,000
[GOKU] This can't be!

29
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,208
I-I didn't even scratch him!

30
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,333
I... guess that means Frieza
wasn't lying about his power...

31
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,291
Which means he is
the strongest fighter

32
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,833
in the universe and
I don't stand a chance.

33
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,291
[BULMA groans]

34
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,500
Wh-Where in the
world am I...?

35
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,458
Ah...

36
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,500
'Kay... Let me think...

37
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,625
There was that frog...

38
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,666
Or was I a frog?

39
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,958
Uhhh...

40
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,416
I remember seeing
Krillin and Gohan...

41
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,666
[BULMA screams]

42
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,500
This is all crazy!

43
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,958
I just can't sit
here and wait!

44
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,458
I've got to take the
bull by the horns

45
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,166
and go fight that
stupid alien.

46
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,083
And if something
happens to me...

47
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:58,166
[GINYU grunting]

48
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,666
[GINYU sighs]

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,333
I gotcha!

50
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,625
You're the slime-ball
who got me into this mess!

51
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,041
[GINYU whimpers]

52
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,333
What's goin' on here?

53
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,250
Goku's Kamehameha attack was
awesome, but nothing happened!

54
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,791
Yeah...

55
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,958
[KRILLIN] How is it possible

56
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,166
that it had no
effect on Frieza?

57
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,083
[GOHAN] I guess my Dad
is losing his power again...

58
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,333
[KRILLIN] Well, then I guess
it's true. Frieza is invincible!

59
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,541
[PICCOLO] The fight
is over for Goku.

60
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,666
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?

61
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,708
King Kai was
right all along.

62
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,166
Before this even started,

63
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,083
he warned us to avoid
Frieza at all cost.

64
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,666
[thinking] Something is
strange about this warrior.

65
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,958
How does a Saiyan have
such incredible power?

66
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,375
They are after all
inferior creatures...

67
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,083
I've never met a fighter
with that kind of strength.

68
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,458
[FRIEZA growls]

69
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,791
[thinking] I must
take him out now!

70
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,041
[FRIEZA growls]

71
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,958
Prepare for battle!

72
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,750
It is time...

73
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
...for your demise.

74
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,500
[FRIEZA growls]

75
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,083
It's all over, Saiyan!

76
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,333
[FRIEZA yells]

77
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,791
[GOKU screams]

78
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,208
I'm coming, Dad!

79
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,666
[GOHAN growls]

80
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,625
[PICCOLO growls]

81
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,333
You weakling.

82
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,916
[GOKU yells]

83
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,791
[GOKU grunts]

84
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,250
[FRIEZA giggles]

85
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,083
[GOKU yells]

86
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,541
[GOKU grunts]

87
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:16,500
[GOKU coughs]

88
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,125
[GOKU grunts]

89
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,375
Well, the
choice is yours.

90
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,125
Are you ready to surrender?

91
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,833
[FRIEZA snarls]

92
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,000
[YAMCHA] King Kai!
What's going on down there?!

93
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,208
[KING KAI] It seems that our
friend has been defeated.

94
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
That's just not possible!

95
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,750
Th-There is nothing
we can do now.

96
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
As I suspected,

97
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,166
there is no being alive that can
bring down the almighty Frieza!

98
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,291
[GOKU grunts]

99
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,416
Well, my friend...

100
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,708
I hope that slapped a
little sense into you.

101
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,291
[FRIEZA] I guess I was mistaken
when I thought you'd be the one

102
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,458
smart enough to join me.

103
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,708
Oh well, just one less
Saiyan to worry about.

104
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,333
[FRIEZA giggles]

105
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,500
[thinking] My energy is
starting to fade fast...

106
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,083
And I don't know if I have
anything left to attack with.

107
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,875
This doesn't look good...

108
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,583
I realize all you Saiyans
want to do is fight,

109
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,166
but fighting is useless.

110
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,500
Unless, of course, you
are superior like me.

111
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:54,000
And that is why I took the
liberty of wiping out your kind.

112
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,708
[VEGETA] Kakarot! Listen to me!

113
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,916
Is that all the power you have?

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,541
Where's your Saiyan pride?!

115
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,041
But... But I never
was a Saiyan...

116
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,583
[VEGETA] Nonsense! What
are you talking about?!

117
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,833
You can't deny your heritage!

118
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,000
Vegeta...

119
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,333
Right now it doesn't
matter what I am...

120
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,416
Forget about it!

121
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
[GOKU gasps]

122
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,166
You must listen to me.

123
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,500
We both that know you
have Saiyan blood

124
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,625
running through your veins.

125
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,750
I feel your pain.

126
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,750
But you must never
forget one thing:

127
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:54,500
It was Frieza who destroyed our
birthplace, the Planet Vegeta.

128
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,541
And now that you are
the only Saiyan left,

129
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,625
it is up to you to
avenge our race!

130
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,708
Th-The pride... of my people.

131
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,291
Think back, Kakarot!

132
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:11,375
Remember your
father... My father...

133
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,791
There's no one
left except for you.

134
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,958
[BARDOCK] My...
son... lives on...

135
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:23,000
[KING VEGETA groans]

136
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,833
So while you may
deny who you are...

137
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,208
[VEGETA] You are
the very last hope

138
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,541
for a lost race of
brave warriors!

139
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,208
Ask yourself this:

140
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,333
Why does Frieza want
you destroyed so badly?

141
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,208
He's afraid a
Super Saiyan will rise up.

142
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,666
The strongest of all!

143
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,875
Destroy him...

144
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,875
Destroy him for the
entire Saiyan race.

145
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,333
Destroy him, for you have
the power within you!

146
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,666
[VEGETA] Now go,
Kakarot, it is time.

147
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,875
Do all that is within your
power to bring down Frieza!

148
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,125
[FRIEZA] Excuse me, I hate
to interrupt your daydream,

149
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,083
but I've got a job to finish.

150
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,708
Good Riddance,
you sniffling...

151
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,291
SAIYAN!

152
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,666
[GOKU yells]

153
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,708
[FRIEZA giggles]

154
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
[FRIEZA] I had you
scared, didn't I?

155
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,000
So now, I say we
have a little fun.

156
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,458
Vegeta...

157
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:55,375
I grew up on planet Earth,
I don't know how to be a Saiyan!

158
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,458
But...

159
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,500
I share in your
disgust for Frieza!

160
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,583
Is your brave,
little speech over?

161
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,791
I must win!

162
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,000
I will not let you beat me!

163
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,416
No! You lose!

00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,375

00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,750
[GOKU] Haah!

00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,208

171
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,750
[FRIEZA] What the--?!

172
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:48,541
[grunting continues]

173
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,666
[FRIEZA yells]

174
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,583
[FRIEZA] I see you've got
some of your energy back.

175
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,416
Or was that all you had left?

176
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,625
[GOKU groans]

177
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:16,500
[FRIEZA] My guess is that
you're all out of gas.

178
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:24,541
[FRIEZA] You see, I can read
you like a book, my friend.

179
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,416
And it's time to finish the
last chapter with a bang...

180
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,750
[FRIEZA giggles]

181
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,208
[GOKU yells]

00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,416

[GOKU grunting]

184
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,291
You can do it, Dad...

185
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,416
[GOKU grunting]

186
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,791

[GOKU yells]

188
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,208
[FRIEZA] Let's see you
get out of this one.

189
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,583
[FRIEZA] I must say
I'm impressed.

190
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,666
Said the spider
to the fly.

191
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,791
[KING KAI growls]

192
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,583
[BUBBLES chatters]

193
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,375
[KING KAI] Huh?!

194
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,375
Listen! What's going on?

195
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,875
It sounds
like Bubbles.

196
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,166
And it's coming from
inside the house.

197
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,875
[BUBBLES chattering excitedly]

198
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:19,166
[BUBBLES groaning]

199
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,166
[GREGORY groans]

200
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,250
[YAMCHA] What
happened, Bubbles?!

201
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,375
[CHIAOTZU] Gregory...

202
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,166
[BUBBLES chatters excitedly]

203
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,625
[TIEN] It looks like
there's somebody in there...

204
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:44,958
[multiple voice mumbling]

205
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:45,875
Hey, you!

206
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,291
Who are you guys?!

207
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,250
Recoome!

208
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,916
Burter!

209
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,541
I'm Jeice!

210
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,875
Guldo!

211
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,833
All of us together are...

212
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,416
the one and only Ginyu Force!

213
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,583
[JIECE] That wasn't very good!

214
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:28,375
[ALL muttering]

215
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,375
All of us together are...

216
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,791
the one and only Ginyu Force!

217
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,083
[GULDO] We stink
without our leader.

218
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,083
[BURTER] Not to mention
we're out of practice!

219
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,958
[RECOOME] Let's give
'em some Ginyu Spirit!

220
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,625
[BURTER] Yeah!
That's what we need!

221
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,750
Ginyu Spirit!

222
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,125
[JEICE] Then let's do it again!

223
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

224
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,583
Who... are they...?

225
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,125
They're whacko.

226
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,458
[GOHAN growls]

227
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,458
I've had enough of this!

228
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,333
I'm going to help him!

229
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,750
No, wait!

230
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't!

231
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,458
My dad's getting
destroyed out there!

232
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,958
Be patient!

233
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,708
Goku isn't finished yet!

234
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:22,041
[PICCOLO] If my guess is right,
Frieza is in for a big surprise.

235
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,208
[FRIEZA] What?

236
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,791
What is he doing?

237
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,291
That's the
Spirit Bomb!

238
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,791
What? "Spirit Bomb"?

239
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,750
The ultimate attack...

240
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,625
Goku was personally trained by
the master himself, King Kai.

241
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,166
It actually draws
energy from the planet

242
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,833
and everything on it.

243
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,833
From mountains and
trees, animals, people...

244
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,000
Right down to the smallest
micro-organisms.

245
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,666
[KRILLIN] And when the
force is strong enough,

246
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,958
it's released in one
massive ball of energy.

247
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,291
Really...?

248
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,958
Maybe Freiza won't have
the last laugh after all.

249
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,166
But, will the energy
ball be strong enough

250
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,833
to take out Frieza?

251
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,541
Because there are hardly any
living things on this planet

252
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,500
to draw energy from!

253
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,416
I can see that!

254
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,583
But we have to trust in
Goku's instincts, Gohan!

255
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,500
It's our only defense
against that monster Frieza!

256
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,125
It's all we have left...

257
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,166
[thinking] This planet
doesn't have near the energy

258
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,708
I need to defeat him.

259
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,125
But if I concentrate, maybe
there's a chance I can draw

260
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,500
what I need from the
stars of Planet Namek.

261
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,750
[thinking] I know I shouldn't
use the Spirit Bomb Attack...

262
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,458
its force could wipe
out this entire planet.

263
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,708
[thinking] But if I
don't, Frieza could

264
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,833
destroy the Universe, so I
really don't have a choice!

265
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,875
[thinking] Get
ready, Frieza!

266
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,750
It's time to take out
the heavy artillery!

267
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,125
[FRIEZA]
Oh, look. How cute...

268
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,041
The little Saiyan is
trying to scare me

269
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,125
with pathetic water tricks.

270
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,583
[FRIEZA] Pity...
He tries so hard.

271
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,541
C'mon...

272
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,833
You just gotta come
through for us!

273
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,291
Give it your best shot!

274
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,708
[KRILLIN gasps]

275
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,541
[PICCOLO gasps]

276
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,333
Wh-What was that?!

277
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,166
C'mon, tell me!

278
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,750
I... don't know...

279
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,458
[GOHAN yells]

280
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,416
[GOHAN] Hey! Look!

281
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,916
Look at that!

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,541
There, up in the sky!

283
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,916
Huh?!

284
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,375
[KRILLIN gasps]

285
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,458
That's...

286
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,000
That's the Spirit Bomb!

287
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,833
And it's about
to detonate!

288
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,708
[NARRATOR] Is Goku truly strong
enough to stop Frieza,

289
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,958
the ultimate fighting machine?

290
