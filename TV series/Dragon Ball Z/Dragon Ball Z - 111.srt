[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,916
it looked like the whole
gang was getting together

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,625
for a Black Water Mist party!

4
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,333
[MARON screams]

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,291
[NARRATOR] Even Piccolo
showed up to take part

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,791
in all of the fun!

7
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,458
But somebody forgot to tell
him that the Spice Boys

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,333
were planning on serving
him as the hors d'oeuvres!

[groaning]

12
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
[NARRATOR] Gohan and his
friends were headed straight

13
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,125
for Kami's Lookout,

14
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,458
to reverse the effects
of the Black Water Mist,

15
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,166
but they were cut off by
Piccolo and his new allies!

16
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,416
[GOHAN]
Piccolo!

17
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,541
[SPICE]
What took you two so long?

18
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,083
[SALT] We've been waiting
for you! So has he!

19
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,000
Man!

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,000
This isn't looking good!

21
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,500
[NARRATOR]
Friends become enemies, today!

[PICCOLO growls]

23
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,000
[SPICE] Well boys, what do
you think of Piccolo now?

24
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,916
He's all set to
serve Garlic Jr.!

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,833
That's because he's
become part of our family!

26
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,125
He's one of us, kid,
just like your mother is!

27
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,208
[GARLIC JR.] Ah, I see the
son of Goku has arrived.

28
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,750
I believe your name
is Gohan, right?

29
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,791
Welcome here, my friend.

30
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,500
I hope you don't mind but,

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,500
I have a question for you!

32
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

33
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,333
I want to know where
your father is!

34
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,041
My father?!

35
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,083
Precisely! I must
find him in order

36
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,291
to carry out my revenge!

37
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,916
Once that is accomplished,
then both you and he...

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,791
will pay double for
your failed attempt

39
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,000
to defeat me!

40
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
No!

41
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,500
Even though I now
rule the Earth,

42
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,916
that isn't good enough
until I exact my revenge

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,166
upon you two!

44
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
[PICCOLO growls]

00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,583

[PICCOLO growling]

47
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,958
So, young Gohan, tell me where

48
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,625
your dear father is hiding.

49
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,708
And I warn you,
don't try to be smart!

50
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,750
My dad would never hide
from the likes of you,

51
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,208
and besides, where he is,

52
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,833
he doesn't even know
your evil kind exist!

53
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,833
Where he is...
What do you mean by that?

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,708
I'll never tell!

55
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,208
Huh?

56
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:17,125
So don't bother to...
ask me that question again!

57
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,125

[GARLIC JR.]
Have it your way, kid!

59
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,583
[GARLIC JR.] Once Goku
realizes that you're here,

60
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,791
it's only a matter of time
before he shows up!

[GARLIC JR. growling]

65
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,875
[GARLIC JR.] Now I remember!
That little kid has the ability

66
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,916
to nullify my power!

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,458
But I can't let
that happen again!

68

You pest!

69
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,375

00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,041
Huh?

80
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,416
Go ahead and take
your best shot!

81
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,541
But if you shoot me,
then you'll also have

82
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
roasted Kami under glass!

Ooh, Master Garlic,
I was wondering,

95
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,416
can we play with our
newfound buddies?

96
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,375
Wait a second!

97
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,541
[GARLIC JR.] All right then, you
both may have sport with them

98
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,250
until Goku shows up!

99
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,791
However...

100

Hm?

101
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,166
[GARLIC JR.]
The coup de grace is all mine,

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,291
so be careful not to go
too far with them!

103
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,166
Yes!

104
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,416
All right, you heard him!
Why don't we get started!

105
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000

Hey!

Don't whoop him too bad!
Save some for me!

109
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,000
But two against one
wouldn't be fair!

110

Ah, like they say, all's
is fair in love and war!

was a little tougher than this!

I'll ever understand

how you chicks can
exercise so much!

you is making me

I must say,

this girl doesn't
have a whole lot

has a name you know

hurt for you to

00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:45,875
show a little respect!

166
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,291
Whatever! If it makes you happy!

167
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,291
[KORIN groans]

168
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,416
All that working out's
making me hungry!

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,125
Why don't you make me something?

170
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,958
--Huh?
--What? Make you something?

171
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,708
[MARON] Would you hurry it up
already! My body needs fuel!

172
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:05,541
Uh, but we've never cooked
anything before, right?

173
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,750
[nervous laughter]

174
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,500
For me, please?

175
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,875
[nervous laughter]

176
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,041
Ah, sure...

177
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,625
Okay!

178
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,875
[KORIN]
We were talking the talk,

179
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,666
now we have to walk the walk!

180
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,041
[YAJIROBI]
Yeah, and like they say,

181
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,416
the way to a woman's heart
is through her stomach!

182
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,458
[KORIN] What? Oh, I guess
that pretty much explains

183
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,833
your strikeout record
with the women!

184
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,833
You know, I think Maron
is taking a shine to me!

185
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,583
[KORIN]
Ah, but once she tastes my

186
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:54,791
Coconut Cream Shrimp Casserole,
she'll be all over me!

187
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,250
[YAJIROBI]
In your dreams, catnip breath!

188
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,458
[MARON]
Oh boys, could you please hurry!

189
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,958
I'm simply starving!

190
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,250
C-coming my precious!

191
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
Poor cat's headed straight
for heartbreak city!

192
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,250
[KRILLIN yelling]

193
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
[SALT cackling]

194
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,916
[KRILLIN yells]

195
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
Krillin!

196
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,750
[GOHAN]
Wake up, Krillin! Wake up!

197
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:40,250
It's okay Gohan,
don't worry about me.

198
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,375
[KRILLIN] There're others
who need your help

199
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,250
a lot more right now!

200
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,166
B-but Krillin!

201
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,458
Go Gohan.
Go before it's too late!

202
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:54,583
Do it for your mother and Bulma!

203
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,416
[PICCOLO growls]

204
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,333
[KRILLIN]
Do it for Piccolo!

205
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:05,375
You see, you haven't breathed in
the Black Water Mist yet, so...

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,708
[cackling]

207
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666

[VEGETA grunting]

210
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,458
Curses! Even with
all of my power,

211
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,958
Kakarot would
easily defeat me!

212
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,166
His power makes mine
seem insignificant!

213
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,791
[VEGETA]
How much more do I have to train

214
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,375
to become a true Super Saiyan?

215
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,750
Tell me!

216
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,791
[VEGETA panting]

217
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,625
[VEGETA gasps]

218
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,958
What the? What was that?

219
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,791
What's going on down there?

220
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,708
Kakarot?

221
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,000
[VEGETA]
Kakarot! He must be back!

222
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,375
I knew it!

223
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,958
[VEGETA]
I just knew it was him!

224
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,583
What?

225
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,416
[VEGETA grunts]

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,916
[VEGETA yells]

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,958
Come and get it!

228
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Now, where did he disappear to?

229
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,833
Oh, now I understand!

230
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,083
[VEGETA] The answers were right
before my eyes all along!

231
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,875
But I was my blinded
by my own ambition!

232
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,000
[VEGETA cackles]

233
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,083
And now that I hold
the key to the secret,

234
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,125
soon I too will
possess the power!

235
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,583
The time has come,

236
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,750
for me to finally
meet my destiny!

237
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:12,708
Beware, Kakarot. Because I too
will become a Super Saiyan!

238
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,625
[GARLIC JR.] That kid's
building up his strength again!

239
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
But this time I'll be prepared!

240
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
[GOHAN grunting]

241
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,416
[GOHAN yells]

242
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,833
That kid's sure
gotta lot of moxy!

243
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,375
You're not kidding,
he's on fire!

244
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
[SALT] Well, I think you should
have first crack at him, okay?

245
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,208
[MUSTARD]
Remember what he did last time?

246
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,250
I say two against one is
our only option against him!

247

[grunting, cackling]

248
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,333

Why you rotten rugrat!

264
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,416
Let me at him!

265
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,791
Save some for me!

[GARLIC JR. cackling]

00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,791
Yes, my pet. Destroy him!

274
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,125
Then the entire universe
will be under my command!

275

[NARRATOR]
Is this "lights out" for Gohan?

278
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,583
And what's keeping our hero,
Goku from saving the day?!

279
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,958
The universe won't rest
