[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,333
A mysterious stranger named
Trunks arrived from the future

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,958
with a warning for
Goku and his friends.

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,833
In three years time, an evil
scientist named Dr. Gero

5
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,916
will unleash two deadly
androids upon the Earth.

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,833
And if events leading up to
the attack are not changed,

7
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,291
the consequences will be
tragic for all of them.

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,916
Trunks left to fight the two
deadly androids in his own time,

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,041
leaving Goku and the others to
prepare themselves for the peril

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,291
that most certainly lie ahead.

11
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,083
It will require long hours
of training and discipline

12
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,083
to get their bodies
into the fighting shape

13
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,375
necessary to defeat
this unseen lethal foe.

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,250
But that's nothing new
to someone like Vegeta.

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,083
While the others
look toward a future

16
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
that has already been written,

17
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,500
Goku faces the daunting
task of leading them all

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,541
on a quest to change
the fate of the world.

19
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,083
Will they be ready to meet this
new Android threat head on?

20
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,083
Can Goku prevent Trunks' dark
predictions from coming to pass?

21
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,458
Only time will tell,
on Dragon Ball Z!

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
Well, I'll show him
that he's not half

28
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,875
as tough as he pretends to be!

29
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,083
I'll show him that I can
be just as tough as he is!

The only thing he hasn't
bruised is his eyebrows.

someday you will be

the strongest Saiyan
in the universe.

[KING VEGETA] Those ships
are headed to distant galaxies.

00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,291
From the day we are born,

230
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:10,041
we Saiyans are examined
for our power and leadership.

231
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,708
The weakest of our people
are sent to planets far away

232
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,958
where they face no
threat from our enemies!

Goodbye, pests!

Vegeta! You come from
a strong blood line

236
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
and you possess
the potential power

237
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,583
to join the super elite
of all Saiyans!

238
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,208
Never forget where you're from
and train very hard, my son!

239
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,000
Because if you have
proven yourself worthy,

240
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,666
perhaps someday you will
become a Super Saiyan!

what you said, Father!

Stop it, Vegeta!

You are in no condition
to be doing this right now!

want to believe it,

but you are made
of flesh and blood!

You know I'm right!

keep quiet and do as I say!

Well, that's good!

267
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,291
Now go back to bed
and get some rest!

268
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,541
Not yet! I do have
something to say!

269
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,583
Huh? Uh... What?
Is something wrong?

270
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,666
Or maybe you're finally
going to apologize to me.

271
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,166
If that's the case,
then let's hear it!

[NARRATOR] Goku and his friends
have only three short years

276

to prepare themselves
for the arrival

277
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,083
of Dr. Gero's evil androids.

278
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,666
And they plan to use
every minute of it!

279
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,541
But will these
powerful new enemies

280
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,750
still be too much
for them to handle?

281
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,208
Not if Vegeta has
anything to say about it.
