[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:21,083
Piccolo went one on one with
the diabolical Android 20!

3
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,541
Brave as ever, Piccolo stood
firm in the face of danger,

4
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,958
even as the evil Android
unleashed a powerful attack!

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,875
But Piccolo was ready
with an attack of his own!

6
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,041
Try as he might, Android 20
seemed incapable

7
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,583
of penetrating
Piccolo's defenses!

[NARRATOR] Outnumbered
and obviously outmatched,

13
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,500
Android 20's chances for
survival were growing slim!

14
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,750
His only option:
a hasty retreat!

15
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,458
[ANDROID 20 thinking] It
would be wise for me to return

16
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,875
to the lab at once!

17
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Trunks
raced to the scene,

18
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,166
and when he arrived,
the young Saiyan

19
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,666
made a startling revelation.

20
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,333
[TRUNKS] Yeah. Even though
I've never seen him before...

21
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,208
I can tell that he's one
of Dr. Gero's creations!

22
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,125
[NARRATOR] Vegeta couldn't
believe his ears.

23
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,541
And neither could anyone else!

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,416
[GOHAN] Wha?

25
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,125
Yeah, no doubt...

26
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,833
[NARRATOR] Incredible as it
may seem, the two Androids

27
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,541
that Vegeta and Piccolo have
fought so hard to defeat

28
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,375
are not the same Androids that
plague Trunks' future world!

29
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,083
But if this mechanical menace
isn't one of the Androids

30
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,458
Trunks had warned
about, who is he?

40
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,875
I'm glad I wasn't here to see
whatever made a mess like that!

41
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,125
Look! I think I can
see them up there.

42
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,416
We'd better go down there and
see if those guys need our help.

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,416
There's no way we're
going down there!

44

[BULMA] Don't worry
so much, Yajirobe!

Goku won't let
anything happen to us!

46

If you go down any
further, I'll...

47
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,333
I'll throw Trunks
out the window!

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,958
Oh? Really?

49
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't think Vegeta
would like you talking

50
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,833
about his son like that.

never, eh... I was gonna, uh...

54
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,708
I think, uh...

55
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,458
Let's just go.

56
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,208
[BULMA] That's more like it.

57
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,500
No... Nonsense...

58
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,916
If that's not the android
you warned us about,

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,375
then who is it?!

60
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,083
Hey, Vegeta, cut the kid a
little slack, would ya'?

61
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,291
So a few of the things he
told us about changed.

62
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,833
Maybe this did too.

63
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,500
We found two androids
just like he said we would.

64
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,625
Does it really matter that
they don't look the same?

65
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,833
Hmm?

66
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,541

returned to the laboratory.

But if I try to
fly through them,

69
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,500
they are bound to capture me.

70
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,583
I must hasten my retreat!

71
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,041
If I do not repair myself
soon, I will be finished!

72

still down there!

Well, it was an easy
mistake, Vegeta.

162
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,958
What?!

163
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,375
[BULMA] With all of the
modifications Dr. Gero

164
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,708
made to himself, it's hard
to tell he was ever human.

165
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,541
It's really amazing
what he's done!

166
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,250
Too bad I read
he's such a jerk.

167
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,708
Now, now...

168
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,625
You told us a pack of lies!

169
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,166
Curse you, boy!

170
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,416
You said Dr. Gero was destroyed
by the Androids he created!

171
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,791
You didn't tell us he'd
turned himself into one!

172
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,916
[TRUNKS] The timeline as
I know it must have shifted

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,291
when I traveled here
from the future!

174
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,583
Oh, man...

175
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:38,166
I was afraid that this
might happen, but...

176
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,291
But it was a calculated
risk that I had to take!

177
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,458
[PICCOLO] Dr. Gero mentioned
two more Androids on the way.

178
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,375
They could be the
ones you told us about

179
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,833
the last time you were here.

180
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,125
[GOHAN] Huh?

181
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,250
But this time, I think
it would be a good idea

182
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,250
for you to tell us
what they look like!

183
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,291
We don't want to make
the same mistake twice.

184
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,958
[TRUNKS] The androids that I
know were created by Dr. Gero,

185
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,166
to be sure. But unlike the
clumsy androids you met today,

186
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,416
these two are
sleek and graceful.

187
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,000
Android 18 is designed to look
like a beautiful young girl.

188
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,041
Android 17 is a young boy
who wears a red scarf

189
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,666
and has long, dark hair.

190
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,958
But they both have the
same cruel, lifeless eyes.

191
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,041
Yes, it's their eyes that
will haunt me the most.

192
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,041
Man, these things
sound pretty mean!

193
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,708
Well, that's one
way of putting it.

194
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,375
These Androids are ruthless!

195
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,875
They seek only
to hurt and destroy!

196
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,416
Do they absorb energy
like the first two?

197
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,583
Huh?!

198
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,708
No. These two don't need to.

199
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,875
Their energy, it
lasts... forever...

[VEGETA] What?!

isn't here right now?

Well, he came down with
that weird heart virus.

207
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,208
He went home for the
antidote that you gave him.

mention it,

that Dr. Gero's lab

was hidden in a cave somewhere
just outside North City...

He's probably long gone!

Maybe not! Nobody saw
him fly away, did they?!

Huh...?

243
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,375
Uh... So what're you saying?

244
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,333
I'm saying that android
is trying to escape on foot!

245
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,166
Which means he probably
hasn't gotten very far!

246
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,958
If that's the case, then we
might just have a chance

to find this lab and destroy
the other two androids

316
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,916
And ask him to hurry here
as soon as he gets better!

317
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,541
I would, but it looks
like I'm stuck here!

318
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,875
That android totalled my plane!

319
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,416
Well, I think it would be best
if you took Bulma home, Gohan.

320
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,791
We should be able to handle
the androids without you.

321
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,000
O-Okay. But be careful...

322
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,208
[PICCOLO] All right,
guys! Let's go!

323
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,333
We're really going to
have to move fast!

324
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,791
--Right.
--Right!

325
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,083
Well, we'd better get going.

326
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,250
Not too fast.

327
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,208
We have a baby on board.

328
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,916
[YAJIROBE] Hey!
What about me?!

329
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,083
Huh...?

330
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,791
[YAJIROBE] I could
use a hand here!

331
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,708
Come on! Hurry!

332
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,750
[ANDROID 20 thinking]
I have run far enough.

333
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,458
I should be able
to fly at this point

334
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,708
without any fear of being seen.

335
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,541
--[ANDROID 20 chuckles]
--[beeping]

336
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,000
[ANDROID 20] Huh?!

337
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,416
[ANDROID 20 growls]

338
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,750
[thinking] Vegeta!

339
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,708
[ANDROID 20 growls]

340
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,583
[ANDROID 20 thinking] But how
did he follow me this far?!

341
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,750
Hmm...?

342
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,625
[ANDROID 20 thinking]
They both followed me!

343
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,166
How did they know
which way I was going?

344
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,500
Wait...

345
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,500
Is it possible they are
headed for my laboratory?

346
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,541
No, it must be a coincidence!

347
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,791
Yes, it has to be
coincidence!

348
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,458
There is no way they could
know the location of my lab!

349
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:50,708
Only a few scientists in the
world possess that information.

350
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,166
Wait!

351
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,500
[ANDROID 20 thinking]
That girl! Bulma!

352
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,583
She is the
daughter of Dr. Brief,

353
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,250
the president of
Capsule Corporation!

354
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,166
She may have learned
of me from her father!

355
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,625
Huh?

356
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,541
[ANDROID 20 gasps]

357
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,625
[thinking] They ARE heading
for my laboratory!

358
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,333
I should never have told
them about 17 and 18.

359
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,125
If they find my androids
before I activate them,

360
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,583
they will try to
destroy them!

361
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,291
No! I cannot let that happen!

362
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,041
Fortunately, even
Dr. Brief does not know

363
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,958
the precise
location of my lab.

364
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,083
I may still get there
before they find it!

365
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,416
[BULMA] Gohan...? I, uhh...

366
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,541
I think it's safe if you
want to go a little faster?

367
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,458
[TRUNKS growls]

368
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
Your father, Trunks?

369
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,708
Well, he was a man
of amazing talents.

370
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:21,416
You wouldn't believe some of the
incredible things he could do.

371
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,750
[BULMA sighs]

372
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,375
[BULMA] But he was a proud man,

373
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,625
and sort of a hard
man to know...

374
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,083
And he never showed any
affection to anyone; even me.

375
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:34,333
That man never once told
me he cared about me...

376
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,041
But... I could tell...

377
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,333
[TRUNKS growls]

378
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,208
So, you think you
can keep up, boy?

379
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:48,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

380
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's see...

381
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,458
[VEGETA yells]

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,375
[TRUNKS growls]

383
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,500
[thinking] It's still
hard for me to believe

384
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,333
that he could be a
Super Saiyan at his age.

385
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,916
But then again, he is my son!

386
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,875
[birds cawing]

387
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:34,375
[GOHAN grunting]

388
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,708
Darn it!

389
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,000
You're weighing
us down, Yajirobe!

390
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,458
Shut up!

391
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,083
[NARRATOR] While Gohan struggles
with his heavy load,

392
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,750
the rest of our heroes
are headed straight

393
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,416
for Dr. Gero's lab.

394
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,708
But what new evils
await them there?

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
